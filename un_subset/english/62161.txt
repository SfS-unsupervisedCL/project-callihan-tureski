attitudes and practices, which in turn generate more poverty, "Expressing concern that the current economic and financial crisis and its consequences on poverty and unemployment may have further contributed to the rise of extremist political parties, movements and groups and exacerbated identity-related issues, and that in this period of economic crisis, non-citizens, members of minorities,

Reaffirms the relevant provisions of the Durban Declaration and of the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, in which States condemned the persistence and resurgence of neo-Nazism, neo-Fascism and violent nationalist ideologies based on racial and national prejudice and stated that those phenomena could never be justified in any instance or in any circumstances; 2.

commitment to the eradication of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including by mobilizing political will at the national, regional and international levels, with a view to achieving concrete results, Recalling further the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted on 22 September 2011, which reaffirmed the political commitment to the full and effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, and their follow-up processes at the national, regional and international levels, Recalling its resolution 66/144, in which it encouraged the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent to develop a programme of action, including a theme, for adoption by the Human Rights Council, with a view to proclaiming the decade starting in 2013 the Decade for People of African Descent, Taking note of Human Rights Council decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006, by which, heeding the decision and instruction of the World Conference, the Council established the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards, Underlining the importance of Human Rights Council resolution 6/22 of 28 September 2007, in which the Council deplored the lack of political will to translate the Durban commitments into concrete action and tangible results, Bearing in mind the responsibility and commitments of the Human Rights Council emanating from the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races, Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance manifest themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple forms of discrimination, Underlining the primacy of political will, international cooperation and adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Stressing the importance of a

the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large as a result, inter alia, of the resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters and the persistent use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies, Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,

the main victims of violence and attacks perpetrated or incited by extremist political parties, movements and groups that have a xenophobic and racist agenda, Acknowledging the central role of resource mobilization, effective global partnership and international cooperation in the context of paragraphs 157 and 158 of the Durban Programme of Action for the successful realization of the primary objectives and commitments undertaken at the World Conference, Expressing grave concern that the principal objective of combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance has not been attained, in particular owing to the lack of progress made in the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, in particular key paragraphs 157 to 159 thereof, and that countless human beings continue to be victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Recognizing that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion and economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practices, which in turn generate more poverty, Expressing concern that the current economic and financial crisis and its consequences with respect to poverty and unemployment may have further contributed to the rise of extremist political parties, movements and groups and exacerbated identity-related issues, and that in this period of economic crisis, noncitizens, members of minorities,

against them, Welcoming the continued commitment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to profiling and increasing the visibility of the struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and recognizing the need for the High Commissioner to make this a cross-cutting issue in the activities and programmes of her Office, Expressing concern at manifestations of intolerance based on religion or belief that can generate hatred and violence among individuals composing different nations, and in this regard emphasizing the importance of respect for religious and cultural diversity, as well as interfaith and intercultural dialogue, which contribute to promoting a culture of tolerance and respect among individuals, societies and nations, Taking note of the work done and the progress made during the ninth and tenth sessions of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, held from 17 to 28 October 2011 and from 8 to 19 October 2012, and the fourth session of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards, held from 10 to 12
