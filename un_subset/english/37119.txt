GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS OF CCW/GGE/XV/WP.3 THE STATES PARTIES TO THE CONVENTION 6 October 2006 ON PROHIBITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CERTAIN CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS WHICH MAY BE DEEMED TO BE EXCESSIVELY INJURIOUS OR TO HAVE INDISCRIMINATE EFFECTS Original: ENGLISH Fifteenth Session Geneva, 28 August - 6 September 2006 Item 10 of the Agenda Third Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects PROPOSAL FOR A MANDATE ON EXPLOSIVE REMNANTS OF WAR (ERW) Presented by the European Union The European Union is in favour of continuing the further work in the CCW beyond the Review Conference on munitions which may become ERW, in particular on the implementation of existing IHL and on possible preventive technical measures. The European Union therefore proposes, with a view to further consultation, that as a minimum the mandate of the Working Group on Explosive Remnants of War be extended at the Review Conference for the year 2007, as follows: "To continue to consider, including through participation of legal experts, the implementation of existing principles of International Humanitarian Law and to further study, on an open-ended basis, with particular emphasis on meetings of military and technical experts, possible preventive measures aimed at improving the design of certain specific types of munitions, including sub-munitions, with a view to minimising the humanitarian risk of these munitions becoming explosive remnants of war. Exchange of information, assistance and co-operation would be part of this work. The Group will report on the work done to the next Meeting of the States Parties."
