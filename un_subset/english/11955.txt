CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT ENGLISH Original: RUSSIAN LETTER DATED 25 APRIL 2000 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARYGENERAL OF THE CONFERENCE TRANSMITTING THE TEXT OF A STATEMENT MADE ON 21 APRIL 2000 BY THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RATIFICATION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TESTBAN TREATY BY THE STATE DUMA OF THE FEDERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION I have the honour to transmit herewith a statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation on 21 April 2000 in connection with the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear TestBan Treaty by the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. I should be grateful if this statement could be issued as an official document of the Conference on Disarmament and distributed to the delegations of all member States of the Conference and nonmember States participating in its work. (Signed): Vasily Sidorov Ambassador Permanent Representative Head of the delegation of the Russian Federation to the Conference on Disarmament GE.00-61098 (E) THE COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TESTBAN TREATY BY THE STATE On 21 April 2000, the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation adopted, by an overwhelming majority, a Federal Act on ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear TestBan Treaty (CTBT). Ratification by the State Duma of CTBT is yet another confirmation of the steady progress made by our country towards strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime, disarmament and strategic stability in the world. The community of nations has come a long way to reach the comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. The journey from the 1963 Moscow Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water to CTBT has taken nearly 40 years. Alongside the recent endorsement of the START-II Treaty by both houses of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, our country, as a great nuclear Power, by ratifying CTBT is demonstrating its sense of responsibility before the international community and its commitment to fulfilment of its obligations in the area of strengthening strategic stability, arms reduction and disarmament, including in the framework of the NonProliferation Treaty (NPT). As the NPT Review Conference draws near, particular stress must be laid on the role of CTBT as a vital factor in strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation regime. We are convinced that both the national interests of the Russian Federation and, to an equal extent, those of humankind as a whole are served by the earliest possible entry into force of CTBT and by making the Treaty universal in its extent. A comprehensive ban on nuclear tests and the signing up of all States with a nuclearweapon potential to this ban would pose an insurmountable obstacle to any attempts aiming at the proliferation and qualitative improvement of these weapons. Once again we call on all countries which have yet to sign or to ratify CTBT to do so as soon as possible, so that the goals proclaimed in the Treaty can be realized in the immediate future.
