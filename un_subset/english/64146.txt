The representative of the United States of America stated that her delegation was not prepared to go along with closure of the application, and acknowledged that there was no consensus. The representative of Morocco stated that the procedure had begun with the letter containing objections, which was sent to the organization in accordance with article 15 in resolution 1996/31, that the Committee should take a decision based on the response, and that it was not a matter of asking new questions. The representative of the United States replied that her delegation reluctantly joined consensus on sending a letter, but it in no way represented the first step towards closure. The representative of Belgium stated that the representative of Morocco had to call for action or ask a new question. The representative of Pakistan proposed that the Committee take more time, or, if there was consensus, he was ready to close. The Chair requested that a question be asked or action be taken, and stated that the application could not remain on the deferred list. The representative of India proposed that the application be deferred. The Committee deferred the application to the next session. 7. At its 22nd meeting, on 23 May 2012, the Committee reviewed the application of the organization Islamic African Relief Agency. The representative of the United States of America called for the closure of the application of the organization, and he recalled that it had been initially removed from status by consensus at the regular session in 2006, due to its ties to terrorism. He stated that the organization violated the most basic tenets of the Charter of the United Nations and would tarnish the credibility of this institution, as it had supported and provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaida, and other terrorist groups. He added that ties to terrorism must be a permanent bar to a non-governmental organization receiving Economic and Social Council status. 8. The representative of the Sudan stated that fighting terrorism was the only field of cooperation between the Sudan and the United States. He added that the Sudan would be the first to ask for the withdrawal of status of that nongovernmental organization if there were any clue indicating its involvement. He stated, however, that the fact is that the organization has no link with such terrorist activities claimed by the delegation of the United States. He regretted that the unjust and hasty decision of the Committee in the resumed session of 2006 did not give the organization enough time to respond to the allegations of the United States. He added that the Committee had voted to reconsider the withdrawal of the application, and decided not to reconsider by only 9 to 8 votes, showing a clear division among the members of the Committee on that decision. He stated that he expected the United States to provide new information or evidence and not to try to punish the organization twice for the same allegations and the accusations of one State, as the delegation of the Sudan in the Committee always works constructively to facilitate the work of the NGOs and not to block them without grounds. He added that the Sudan had not found any thread of evidence that the NGO has any other activities than humanitarian work, and that the organization carries out a wide range of humanitarian and peacebuilding activities in Africa. He also requested to give the organization the right of reply, in accordance with article 15 of resolution 1996/31. 9. The representative of the United States of America stated that the activities of the organization cannot be viewed as having a statute of limitation and recalled that the Committee had acted similarly at the previous session to close consideration of the application of a Swiss organization, when India had indicated that the leaders of the organization were civilian aircraft hijackers of 30 years earlier. He said the organization had already provided replies to questions posed by the Committee. 10. The representative of the Sudan asked not to use the "allergic reaction" to AlQaida and terrorism and questioned whether an organization could be deprived of consultative status forever. He also asked if the status would be withdrawn because the Sudan is a small African country unlike the United States, while the Sudan has very few non-governmental organizations. 11. The representative of the United States of America stated that his delegation had submitted a formal motion to close consideration of the application. However, the representative of the Sudan called for a no-action motion in order to give the organization time to respond to the objections, in accordance with article 15 of resolution 1996/31. The Chair, citing a legal opinion of the Office of Legal Affairs noted that although there is a practice of the Committee to send a letter informing the organizations of objections, there are precedents when no such notification was sent, despite requests of some members, as in the case of Human Rights Foundation in 2008. 12. At its 23rd meeting, also on 23 May 2012, the Committee resumed its consideration of the application. The Chair stated that the representative of the Sudan had moved to adjourn the debate in accordance with rule 50 of the rules of procedures of the Economic and Social Council, in order to give the organization an opportunity to respond to the objections in the Committee. She added that the motion would have precedence, in accordance with rule 52. 13. The representatives of Cuba and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) spoke in support of the no-action motion, in order to obtain more information. The representative of the United States of America spoke in opposition of the motion and was interrupted five times when the representative of the Sudan requested the floor on procedural grounds. He stated that the decision was about whether ties with terrorism could be tolerated and he called on the Committee to take its responsibility seriously. He recalled that his delegation had stated in the previous session its intention to close the application, but agreed to wait for the current session in order to allow the organization to respond. He added that the representative of the Sudan had then noted that the willingness of the United States of America to defer the decision confirmed article 15 of resolution 1996/31. The representative of Belgium also spoke in opposition of the no-action motion, stating that every motion should be considered on its own merit. 14. The no-action motion was carried by a roll-call vote of 9 to 5, with 2 abstentions. Of the 19 members of the Committee, 16 were present and voting. The voting was as follows: In favour: China, Cuba, Morocco, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Senegal, Sudan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). Against: Belgium, Bulgaria, Israel, Peru, United States of America. Abstaining: India, Kyrgyzstan. Absent: Burundi, Mozambique, Turkey. 15. After the vote, the Chair stated that the concerns of the Committee would be conveyed to the organization. The representative of the Sudan expressed his expectation that the Committee would grant status at the next session after the organization had waited for the stipulated three years, especially in the absence of new evidence. The representative of the United States of America stated that the United States would use every means at their disposal to prevent that organization from being accredited again. 16. The representatives of Cuba, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), and Morocco condemned terrorism and stated that terrorist organizations and organizations that supported, financed, or were linked to terrorism could not have consultative status. They requested more information to determine if the organization was involved in terrorism. Applications closed without prejudice 17. At its 30th meeting, on 30 May, the Committee decided to close without prejudice consideration of the applications of 22 non-governmental organizations that had not responded to the questions of the Committee despite three reminders sent to the organizations over the course of two consecutive sessions of the Committee (see chap. I, draft decision I (e)). B. New applications for consultative status and new requests for reclassification 18. The Committee considered item 3 (b) of its agenda, New applications for consultative status and new requests for reclassification at its 18th through 30th meetings, on 21 to 30 May. The Committee considered a total of 119 new applications for consultative status. New applications recommended 19. Of the 119 organizations whose new applications had been received, the Committee recommended that the following 70 organizations should be granted consultative status with the Council (see chap. I, draft decision I, para. (a)): Alzheimer's Disease International -- International Federation of Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Societies Oidhaco, Bureau international des droits humains -- action Colombie 20. At its 30th meeting, on 30 May 2012, the Committee heard a statement made by the representative of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, who spoke as an observer. He requested to officially register the protest of his Government against the application of the organization Khmer Kampuchea-Krom Federation, which was recommended for special consultative status by the Committee. He stated that the organization violated the spirit, purposes, and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as paragraphs 2 and 57 of resolution 1996/31 by advocating and promoting secession in the territory of Viet Nam, as revealed in the official website of the organization and in the statements of its leaders. He added that the organization was a foreign-based organization that did not in any way represent the ethnic Khmer people in Viet Nam and has carried out many politically motivated acts, such as slandering, inciting, and undermining the national unity of the State of Viet Nam. He emphasized that 54 ethnic groups in Viet Nam had been living together for generations in one whole territory in unity and mutual assistance in the cause of national construction and defence. He also stressed that the State implemented policies to improve the conditions of life of ethnic minority groups and in fact, the life of all ethnic groups, including that of the Khmers, had been constantly enhanced. The representatives of Pakistan, Cuba, the Russian Federation, India, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Nicaragua regretted that these facts were not available to the Committee during its deliberations on the application, supported bringing the matter to consideration by the Council, and noted the importance of exchanging information with Observer States while considering applications. The representative of the United States of America stated that her delegation would not support overturning the consensus decision of the Committee to recommend granting special consultative status to the organization in the Council. She also pointed out that her delegation had looked very closely at the information presented by the organization before joining the consensus. New applications deferred 21. The Committee deferred its consideration of the applications of the following 49 organizations pending receipt of questions posed by the Committee to the organizations during its 2012 resumed session: 350.org Acronym Institute African Refugee Development Center Alternatives, réseau d'action et communication pour le développement international American Library Association Anchor of Salvation International Ministries Asociación Española para el Derecho Internacional de los Derechos Humanos Association Tierra Incógnita Canadian Shooting Sports Association Care Continuum Alliance Casa Generalizia della Società del Sacro Cuore Centre pour les droits civils et politiques Conservation International Foundation Deutsches Komitee für UN Women Educació per a l'Acció Crítica Environmental Justice Foundation Charitable Trust Equal Rights Trust Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights FN Forbundet Fondation Alkarama Fondation pour les études et recherches sur le developpement international Friends of ISTAR Fundación DARA Internacional Geneva Institute for Human Rights Helping Hands International Foundation Human Rights Foundation Institute for Human Rights and Business Institute for Practical Idealism International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience International Family Forestry Alliance Jewish Voice Ministries International Negev Coexistence Forum Organisation pour la femme et le développement Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine Réseau international des droits humains Rokpa International Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung -- Gesellschaftsanalyse und Politische Bildung Simons Foundation Sisters Inside Society for the Policing of Cyberspace Solar Energy Industries Association Stichting Global Human Rights Defence Stichting Justitia et Pax Nederland Un Ponte Per... Under The Same Sun Fund United Sikhs World Faith World Pulse Voices Requests for reclassification 22. At its 25th meeting, on 24 May 2012, and at its 29th meeting, on 29 May 2012, the Committee considered five requests for reclassification of consultative status, which included one new request for reclassification, contained in document E/C.2/2012/R.3/Add.1, and four deferred requests for reclassification, contained in document E/C.2/2012/CRP.7. It decided to recommend reclassification of status for one organization from special to general consultative status (see chap. I, draft decision I, subpara. (b)). 23. At the same meetings, the Committee decided to defer its consideration of the application for reclassification of status of the following four organizations: Geriatrics Care Foundation of Pakistan International Federation of Consular Corps and Associations International Institute of Administrative Sciences World Council for Curriculum and Instruction Requests for name change 24. At its 27th meeting, on 25 May 2012, the Committee considered seven requests for name change by organizations in consultative status, contained in document E/C.2/2012/CRP.8. At its 28th meeting, also on 25 May 2012, it decided to take note of all seven changes of names (see chap. I, draft decision I, subpara. (c)). III. Quadrennial reports submitted by non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Council A. Quadrennial reports submitted by non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Council that had been deferred at the resumed session 25. At its 26th meeting, on 25 May, the Committee had before it a memorandum by the Secretary-General containing a compilation of quadrennial reports submitted by non-governmental organizations in general and special consultative status with the Council on their activities during the period from 1998 to 2010, which had been deferred from previous sessions of the Committee (see E/C.2/2012/CRP.6). Of the 21 reports, the Committee took note of the following report of one organization (included in chap. I, draft decision I, subpara. (d)): 26. Following the decision, the representative of Cuba stated that her delegation disassociated itself from the decision to take note of that quadrennial report. She stated that the actions of the organization were very far from meeting the standards and principles NGOs must respect when in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council, which are clearly stated in resolution 1996/31. She added that the organization carried out politically motivated destabilizing actions against legitimate governments, particularly of developing countries. She explained that that NGO is not independent and that its annual budget is $1.5 billion, funded mostly by the United States Government and its agencies. She stressed among those actions the submission of manipulated and malicious reports against Cuba, attempting to promote international rejection of the Cuban Revolution. She also stressed that some of the representatives of the organization had clear links with terrorists. The delegations of Nicaragua, the Sudan and Venezuela also disassociated themselves from the decision and supported the statement by the representative of Cuba. 27. The Committee decided to defer further consideration of the following 20 deferred quadrennial reports from 16 organizations: Armenian Assembly of America (2007-2010) Asociatia Pro Democratia (2007-2010) Centrist Democrat International (1998-2001) (2002-2005) (2006-2009) France libertés: Fondation Danielle Mitterrand (2007-2010) Freedom House (2007-2010) Human Rights First (2007-2010) Human Rights Watch (2005-2008) International Federation of Journalists (2005-2008) International PEN (2006-2009) International Press Institute (2001-2004) (2005-2008) International Union of Socialist Youth (2005-2008) National Council of Women of Thailand (2000-2003) Reporters sans frontières international (2005-2008) Society for Threatened Peoples (2001-2004) (2005-2008) Syriac Universal Alliance (2007-2010) Ukrainian World Congress (2003-2006) B.

At its 26th meeting, on 25 May 2012, the Committee considered agenda item 4 (b), Review of quadrennial reports submitted by non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Council.

The Committee decided to defer consideration of one report of the following organization: Ukrainian World Congress (2007-2010) 29.

Suspension of consultative status of organizations that have failed to submit their quadrennial reports for one or more consecutive reporting periods 30. At its 27th meeting, on 25 May 2012, the Committee considered agenda item 6 (c). The Secretariat informed the Committee that it had sent three notifications to non-governmental organizations that had not fulfilled the requirement to submit quadrennial reports in 2011, pursuant to Council resolution 2008/4. The Secretariat had also sought assistance from the permanent missions to the United Nations of the countries where the non-governmental organizations had their headquarters. 31. In this regard, the Committee adopted a draft decision recommending that the Council suspend, for a period of one year, the consultative status of 202 non-governmental organizations that had failed to submit quadrennial reports, in accordance with the guidelines set out in Council resolution 2008/4 (see chap.

The Committee further requested the Secretariat to advise the concerned organizations of the suspension of their consultative status and to inform the permanent missions to the United Nations of the countries where the non-governmental organizations had their headquarters. D. Reinstatement of consultative status of non-governmental organizations that had been previously suspended due to non-submission of their quadrennial reports 32. At its 27th meeting, on 25 May, in accordance with Council resolution 2008/4 and Council decision 2011/230, the Committee decided to recommend reinstatement of the consultative status of 27 organizations upon receipt of their pending quadrennial reports prior to the termination of the suspension period (see chap.

The Secretariat informed the Committee that it had also sought assistance from the permanent missions to the United Nations of the countries where the non-governmental organizations had their headquarters. 34. Accordingly, the Committee decided to recommend that the Council withdraw the consultative status of the 75 non-governmental organizations with continued outstanding quadrennial reports, in accordance with the guidelines set out in Council resolution 2008/4 and recalling decision 2011/230 (see chap. I, draft decision V). The Committee further requested the Secretary-General to advise the concerned organizations of the withdrawal of their consultative status and to inform the permanent missions to the United Nations of the countries where the non-governmental organizations had their headquarters. IV. Strengthening of the Non-Governmental Organizations Branch of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat 35.

The Branch highlighted the challenges facing both the Committee on NGOs and the NGO Branch in connection with rapidly increasing workloads, in particular with regard to new applications, and emphasized the need for resources to provide much-needed support to the paperless system, with a focus on maximizing its efficiency in meeting the increased workload of the Committee. V. Review of the methods of work of the Committee: implementation of Council resolution 1996/31, including the process of accreditation of representatives of non-governmental organizations, and Council decision 1995/304 37. Delegations requested more time to consider issues that could contribute to improve the working methods of the Committee, including the procedure for reviewing the quadrennial reports of non-governmental organizations. Informal consultations would be held to address those at a later stage. At its 26th meeting, on 25 May, the representative of India requested that in the future the Secretariat present to the Committee the name change applications along with accompanying documentation.

Consideration of special reports and complaints by Member States Ma'arij Foundation for Peace and Development 39. On 11 May 2012, the Non-Governmental Organizations Branch received a letter of complaint from the Permanent Mission of Israel to the United Nations concerning a violation of resolution 1996/31 by an organization with special consultative status with the Council, Ma'arij Foundation for Peace and Development. At its 18th meeting, on 21 May 2012, the Committee took note of the letter (see annex I). Interfaith International 40. At its 18th meeting, on 21 May 2012, the Committee heard a complaint by the representative of Pakistan, following a letter of complaint from the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the United Nations (see annex II), concerning the organization Interfaith International, which had its consultative status suspended by a consensus decision in 2010 for two years under Economic and Social Council decision 2010/215. The representative of Pakistan explained that the organization had violated its suspension by organizing events and distributing fliers at the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council, misrepresenting itself, including on its website, as an organization with consultative status. He added that the organization had also been reprimanded in the past by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for such behaviour. He requested that the consultative status of the organization be withdrawn for flagrantly violating Council decision 2010/215 and misleading the United Nations system, Member States, and civil society. The Chief of the NGO Branch of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs confirmed that the organization had violated the terms of its suspension. 41. The representative of Belgium called on the Committee to give the organization the opportunity to respond, in accordance with article 15 of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31, and expressed a preference to move for suspension again. The representatives of China, the Sudan, Senegal, Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Morocco, Turkey and Burundi supported the proposal by Pakistan. The representative of the United States of America, supported by Peru and Israel, requested more time to consider the complaint, hear from the organization, and take action during this session. The representative of Switzerland, speaking as an Observer State, also noted that article 56 of Council resolution 1996/31 granted the organization the right to reply. The representative of Pakistan stated that although there were no provisions for such a right of reply in Council resolution 1996/31, in order to satisfy the principles of transparency and due process, he was ready for a decision by the Committee after considering the reply of the concerned NGO. 42. At is 19th meeting, also on 21 May 2012, the Committee decided to convey a letter to the organization, and seek its response by 24 May 2012, inquiring why it had used a logo identifying itself as an organization with consultative status; if it had participated and organized side events at the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council; to explain how it had participated and organized these activities while its status had been suspended; why its website continued to show that the organization was in consultative status while it was suspended; and if it considered these activities and acts to be in conformity with Council decision 2010/215 and resolution 1996/31. 43. At its 27th meeting, on 25 May 2012, the Committee resumed its consideration of the complaint by Pakistan. It had reviewed the response from the organization on its inquiry. The representative of Pakistan stated that the organization's response confirmed that it had clearly violated the terms of its suspension. Therefore, in order to respect the decisions of the Committee and to ensure that the activities of all non-governmental organizations with consultative status are in accordance with the rules of procedure, he called upon the Committee to withdraw the consultative status of the NGO in accordance with Council resolution 1996/31. 44. The Committee, by a consensus decision, recommended that the Council withdraw the status of the organization (see chap. I, draft decision II). 45. The representative of the United States of America stated that her delegation reluctantly joined consensus but that the United States did not believe the actions of the NGO justified that extreme measure. The representative of Belgium stated that they believed withdrawal to be a disproportionate sanction, but joined consensus in respect of the few rules of the Committee. Centre Europe-tiers monde 46. At its 18th meeting, on 21 May 2012, the Chair informed the Committee that the two-year suspension period of the consultative status of Centre Europe-tiers monde (Council decision 2010/221 of 19 July 2010) would expire in July 2012. 47. At the same meeting, the Committee heard a statement by the representative of Turkey, concerning Centre Europe-tiers monde (see annex III). He recalled the reasons for the consensus decision of the Committee suspending the consultative status of the organization; noted the letter of commitment from the organization submitted upon the request of the Committee; and also noted that the website of the organization continued to violate resolution 1996/31. He stated that Turkey would not object to reinstatement of status, but demanded that the organization immediately take the necessary action to ensure that the reasons that had led to the suspension would not be repeated. Finally, he underlined that Turkey would be following carefully the activities of Centre Europe-tiers monde, and if the non-governmental organization, after the reinstatement of status, were found to have acted contrary to its commitments, to violate its obligations and responsibilities, and to repeat, but not limited to, a similar pattern of acts before the suspension, Turkey reserved the right to seek withdrawal or another suspension of the consultative status of the organization. VII. Provisional agenda and documentation of the 2013 session of the Committee 48. At its 30th meeting, on 30 May 2012, the Committee considered item 9 of its agenda and had before it the draft provisional agenda for its 2013 session (E/C.2/2012/L.1). 49.

At its 30th meeting, on 30 May 2012, the Committee had before it a draft report and authorized the Rapporteur to finalize the report with the support of the Secretariat and in consultation with the members of the Committee, as appropriate, with a view to its submission to the Economic and Social Council for appropriate action. 56. At its 31st meeting, on 8 June 2012, the Committee adopted the present report. I write to alert you about a very disturbing event held by the Ma'arij Foundation for Peace and Development -- an organization that received its United Nations accreditation through the NGO Committee. On 19 March 2012, the Ma'arij Foundation hosted a side event at the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva that featured Ismail al-Ashqar, a senior member of Hamas, which is recognized as a terrorist organization by numerous States. Hamas systematically kills and tortures political opponents; uses children as human shields and suicide bombers; brutally subjugates women; and deliberately targets Israeli schools, synagogues and cities in continuous rocket attacks. The Hamas charter continues to call for the destruction of Israel -- a Member State of the United Nations -- and the genocide of the Jewish people. Giving Hamas this platform in Geneva, under United Nations auspices, made a complete mockery of the United Nations. By hosting this event, the Ma'arij Foundation violated its obligation, under Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31, to "conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment and nature of their consultative relations with the Council". The United Nations cannot serve as a platform to deliver messages of hate and incitement. In the face of the Ma'arij Foundation's flagrant breach of conduct, I kindly request that this official complaint be brought to the attention of the members of the United Nations Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations during the current session held between 21 and 30 May 2012. (Signed) Haim Waxman Ambassador Deputy Permanent Representative This is with reference to the upcoming resumed session of the NGO Committee from 21 to 30 May 2012. I would like to take this opportunity to convey that during this session the Government of Pakistan would like to submit a Special Report for the consideration of the Committee members concerning repeated misconduct by an NGO, "Interfaith International", under agenda item 7. In 2010, on the recommendation of the NGO Committee, Economic and Social Council had suspended the consultative status of Interfaith International for two years (Council decision 2010/215). It is important to recall that this decision was taken by consensus and one of the prime charges against this NGO were continued disregard for the United Nations rules and procedures for participation of nongovernmental organizations in United Nations activities. Unfortunately, however, this suspension did not have any impact on the NGO, which has regrettably continued with its uncalled-for activities. In March 2012, during the nineteenth session of the Human Rights Council, this NGO, in violation of the well-established rules for NGOs participation in the United Nations activities, organized side events within United Nations premises and in complete disregard of the Economic and Social Council decision, openly distributed flyers of these events showing itself as an NGO with Economic and Social Council consultative status. Mr. Graves, Secretary General of this NGO, even chaired and moderated one of these side events. Copies of the flyers of these events as well as the correspondence between the Pakistan Mission and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on this subject are attached for ready reference. As you are well aware, according to paragraph 67 of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31, participation in United Nations activities and use of its facilities is reserved for NGOs with consultative status. This NGO not only breached this well-established rule but also misled the United Nations system, Member States and the very community it belongs to, i.e., civil society, by portraying itself as an NGO with Economic and Social Council consultative status. This is not only a breach of existing United Nations rules of procedures for the participation of NGOs in its activities but a flagrant violation of the decision taken by the Economic and Social Council. Such misconduct cannot and should not be tolerated by the NGO Committee. We, therefore, would like to submit the case for the withdrawal of the consultative status of this NGO. Such a decision by this Committee must ensure respect and credibility of its decisions by the NGO Community as well as to ensure that participation of NGOs in United Nations activities are strictly regulated in accordance with the rules and procedures that have been laid down. I count on the wisdom of the respected members of the NGO Committee to wholeheartedly support this decision. My delegation remains at your and other Committee members' disposal to answer further queries and questions, if any. (Signed) Raza Bashir Tarar Acting Permanent Representative Statement delivered by the representative of Turkey at the 18th meeting, on 21 May 2012 Turkey appreciates the role and contributions of the NGOs in the field of human rights and welcomes the efforts of many NGOs to make positive and constructive contributions to the United Nations system. Turkey continues to extend its support to them in line with the importance it attaches to the promotion and protection of human rights since they further the cause of human rights at the national and international levels. It is with the same understanding and expectation that some principles have been laid down in conjunction with the work of the NGOs in the United Nations system, as stipulated in relevant paragraphs of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31 of 25 July 1996. In line with that resolution, the NGOs are unquestionably expected to observe the United Nations principles in their work. At the 28th meeting of its resumed session in May 2010, this august Committee decided by consensus to recommend suspension for a period of two years of the consultative status of the organization "Centre Europe-tiers monde", which failed to conform with these principles and the basic requirements set out in Council resolution 1996/31 by disrespecting the territorial integrity and political unity of Turkey; undertaking unsubstantiated and politically motivated allegations against Turkey; inciting and condoning acts of terrorism against States Members of the United Nations and by becoming a propaganda vehicle for the PKK/Kongra-Gel, a terrorist organization responsible for the death of tens of thousands of innocent people featuring on the lists of terrorist organizations of many countries and organizations. Furthermore, the Committee had also decided to request the organization to submit a letter to the Committee, stating that it will conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment and nature of its consultative relations with the Council, as stipulated in paragraph 55 of Council resolution 1996/31. The Committee was made aware of the submission of this letter during its regular session. We welcome the fact that by this consensus the Committee has clearly demonstrated its responsible and consistent attitude with regard to the crucial importance of conforming with the principles and the basic requirements set out in Council resolution 1996/31. We also take note of the fact that this organization sent a letter by which it pledged that it would respect and uphold the requirements stipulated under paragraph 55 of the resolution. We consider it a commitment for future undertakings. Unfortunately, despite this commitment, the website of this NGO continues to include materials in forms of statements or interventions, which had in fact led to the suspension of its status, disrespecting United Nations terminology; claiming unsubstantiated and politically motivated allegations against Turkey, and moreover defending terrorists and international narcotics traffickers as "human rights defenders". Turkey will not object this time to the restitution of the status of Centre Europe-tiers monde. Yet we expect it to abide by its formal commitment and take the necessary measures to ensure that the reasons that caused the suspension would not be repeated. Recalling its letter by which it states that it will conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment and nature of its consultative relations with the Council, we demand that it immediately undertake necessary changes and deletions in its website in line with United Nations terminology. Turkey will be following carefully Centre Europe-tiers monde activities and if that NGO, after the restitution of the status, is found to act contrary to its commitment as set forth in its letter, to violate its obligations and responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations and the basic requirements set out in resolution 1996/31, and to repeat, but not limited to, a similar pattern of acts before the suspension, the Turkish delegation reserves the right to seek the withdrawal of its status or another suspension of the NGO. Recalling lastly the function of the Committee to monitor that the NGOs and its representatives conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment and nature of its consultative relations with the Economic and Social Council, I request this statement be included in the official record of our meeting.
