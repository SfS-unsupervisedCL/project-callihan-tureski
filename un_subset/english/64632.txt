Tenth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names New York, 31 July-9 August 2012 Item 5 of the provisional agenda* Reports on the work of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names, its divisions, working groups and task teams since the Ninth Conference Activity of the French-speaking Division Summary** Since the last session of the Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN), the French-speaking Division's activity has been based mainly on its work programme, which includes: (a) Information-gathering, chiefly for the French exonyms database "Le tour du monde en fran√ßais" ("Around the world in French"); (b) Information dissemination, through the Division's website and the publication of a new toponymic newsletter, the Bulletin d'information toponymique; (c) Support for research and training, in particular through the holding of a symposium in France. In addition, the French-speaking Division has sought to link together UNGEGN and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in efforts to have geographical names recognized as part of the cultural heritage of nations. The Division has also begun reviewing the French content of the search site for resolutions of the United Nations Conferences on the Standardization of Geographical Names in French, a site set up by the UNGEGN Working Group on Evaluation and Implementation. * E/CONF.101/1. ** The full text, prepared by Pierre Jaillard, Chair of the French-speaking Division, and Marie-Eve Bisson, Secretary a.i., is available in the language of submission only from http://unstats.un.org/ unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/ungegnConf10.html.
