How long will our earth have to endure the countless acts of violence inflicted on women and girls? The World Union of Catholic Women's Organizations, active in more than 60 States, strongly condemns the violence suffered, from the beginning of time, by millions of women and girls. That impermissible assault on their personal integrity and dignity is a visible sign of the discrimination inflicted upon them, a discrimination that breaks and destroys women, who are the bearers of life. In combating such discrimination, our organization and its member organizations need all available skills and political, financial, human and social means: 路 To ensure that all women can enjoy fundamental rights, the right to life from conception to birth, the right to education, the right to work, the right to housing and the right to health; 路 To ensure that all women and girls are respected as human beings and that they can contribute to the well-being of their families and society; 路 To ensure that all women are freed from the yoke of male domination, which is linked to traditions that are contrary to the dignity of the person; 路 To participate in the decision-making process up to the highest level in order to promote legislation or improve existing laws. Our organization and its member organizations will focus on the struggle to abolish forced marriages, prevent the early sexualization of children, provide assistance to street children, combat poverty, combat the sexual exploitation of children and provide assistance to migrant populations. In dealing with such violence, solidarity between peoples is the bulwark that will ensure that the physical, moral and psychological integrity and full dignity of every woman and every girl is respected.
