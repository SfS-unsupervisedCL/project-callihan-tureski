Committee on Relations with the Host Country Letter dated 10 October 2000 from the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Committee I have the honour to address you to request the circulation of note verbale NV534 dated 10 October 2000 from the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the United States Mission to the United Nations (see annex) as an official document of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country. The attached note verbale refers to the issue of the late issuance, without justification, of the entry visa to Mr. José Rufino Menéndez, Cuban adviser in the First Committee of the General Assembly. (Signed) Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla Ambassador Permanent Representative The Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations presents its compliments to the United States Mission to the United Nations and has the honour to express the Cuban Government's deep concern over the late issuance, without justification, of the entry visa to José Rufino Menéndez, Cuban adviser in the First Committee of the General Assembly during its present session. Mr. Menéndez should have received his entry visa to the United States on 29 September 2000, according to the agreed terms for the issuance of visas. However, the visa was not issued until 3 October 2000, preventing Mr. Menéndez from attending four days of the first week's work of the First Committee of the General Assembly, as a result of all the rearrangements of his travel itinerary. New York, 10 October 2000
