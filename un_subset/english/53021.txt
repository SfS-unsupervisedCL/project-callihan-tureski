Sixty-fifth session Agenda item 115 Follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit Letter dated 15 September 2010 from the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to refer to the note verbale of 14 September 2010 from the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations, transmitting the third national report of Cuba on its progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (see annex). This publication provides an up-to-date and objective picture of Cuba’s progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, drawing on reliable information that has been consolidated and verified by the National Statistical Office of Cuba, and further substantiated by data furnished by all the Cuban ministries and institutions that have systematically conducted studies and monitored progress in this regard. The report concludes that Cuba has fully achieved many of the Millennium Development Goal targets before the deadline, and that it is working hard both to reach the other targets and to improve earlier its target indicators by 2015. I should be grateful if you would have the present report circulated as an official document of the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly under agenda item 115. (Signed) Pedro Nuñez Mosquera Ambassador Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations Annex [Original: English, French and Spanish]
