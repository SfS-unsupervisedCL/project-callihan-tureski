Summary of the Committee's activities during the reporting period 3. For 2000, the bureau consisted of Said Ben Mustapha (Tunisia) as Chairman, with the delegations of Jamaica and the Netherlands providing the two Vice-Chairmen. 4. At its 16th meeting, on 8 March 2000, the Committee reviewed, among other things, measures for enhancing the effective implementation of the arms embargo imposed by the Security Council in its resolution 733 (1992) with a view to curbing the continued flow of arms to Somalia. The Committee decided, in accordance with paragraph 12 of Security Council resolution 954 (1994), to seek the cooperation and assistance of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in the enforcement of the mandatory arms embargo against Somalia. Towards that end, the Chairman addressed letters dated 20 March 2000 to the Secretary-General of OAU and the Executive Secretary of IGAD respectively, appealing to both organizations to provide to the Committee, on a regular basis, any information they might have or come across relating to any violations or suspected violations of the arms embargo. 5. Following that meeting, on 13 March 2000, the Committee issued a press statement in which it gave publicity to its decision to remind Member States of their obligation to ensure the strict implementation of the arms embargo and to seek the cooperation of the above-mentioned regional groups. It further expressed its endorsement of a proposal to undertake a fact-finding mission to neighbouring countries by the Chairman to assess the difficulties being encountered in implementing the arms embargo and to encourage Member States in the region and regional organizations to cooperate actively with the Committee in the discharge of its mandate. 6. On 22 March 2000, the Chairman of the Committee addressed a note verbale (SCA/2/00(3)) to all Permanent Representatives/Permanent Observers to the United Nations reminding them of their obligations under resolutions 733 (1992) and 954 (1994) and requesting their assistance towards the effective implementation of the arms embargo. 7. In a note verbale dated 3 May 2000 addressed to the Chairman of the Committee, the Permanent Mission of Chile to the United Nations reported that, according to the records of the Department of Mobilization of the Ministry of National Defence of Chile, there was no record of any exports of military material to Somalia. 8. In a presidential statement (S/PRST/2000/22) issued on 29 June 2000, the Security Council reminded all States of their obligation to comply with the measures imposed by resolution 733 (1992) and urged them to take all necessary steps to ensure the full implementation and enforcement of the arms embargo. The Council further urged all States, the United Nations and other international organizations and entities to report to the Committee established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) information on possible violations of the arms embargo. III. Observations 9. The Committee does not have any specific monitoring mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of the arms embargo and would like to recall its previous observations that it relies solely on the cooperation of States and organizations in a position to provide information on violations of the arms embargo.
