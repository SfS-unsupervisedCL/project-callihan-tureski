UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1998/519 16 June 1998 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: FRENCH LETTER DATED 15 JUNE 1998 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL I have the honour to transmit herewith a statement on the situation in Burundi issued by the Presidency of the European Union. I should be grateful if you would have the text of this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) John WESTON Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations English Page Annex [Original: English and French] Statement on the situation in Burundi issued by the Presidency of the European Union The adoption on 4 June by the National Assembly of Burundi of a Constitutional Act and a political platform for transition is an important step towards peace and national reconciliation in Burundi. It is a significant gesture which offers hope that the Burundians will pursue the efforts which they have begun. This important step towards national reconciliation must be complemented by negotiations between all the Burundi parties without exception, from both inside and outside the country. At this crucial juncture for the future of Burundi, the European Union calls upon all the Burundi parties due to be in Arusha on 15 June in the framework of the regional peace initiative led by the former President of the United Republic of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, to assume the important responsibilities they have to the people of Burundi, who have already endured so much suffering and are hoping for peace. The Central and Eastern European countries and Cyprus associated with the European Union and the European Free Trade Association countries, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.
