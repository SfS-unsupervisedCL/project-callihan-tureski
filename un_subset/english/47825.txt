Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006) Note verbale dated 30 April 2008 from the Permanent Mission of Switzerland to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Committee The Permanent Mission of Switzerland to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006), and has the honour to transmit Switzerland's report on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1803 (2008) (see annex). [Original: French] Report submitted by Switzerland pursuant to Security Council resolution 1803 (2008) In paragraph 13 of resolution 1803 (2008) of 3 March 2008, the Security Council "calls upon all States to report to the Committee [established pursuant to resolution 1737 (2006)] within 60 days of the adoption of this resolution on the steps they have taken with a view to implementing effectively paragraphs 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 above". In keeping with this request, Switzerland hereby presents the steps it has taken in implementation of those paragraphs. As noted in its reports of 23 February 2007 (S/AC.50/2007/40) and 11 June 2007 (S/AC.50/2007/109), Switzerland implements the sanctions envisaged in resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007) primarily by means of the ordinance instituting measures against the Islamic Republic of Iran (hereinafter "the ordinance"), which was adopted on 14 February 2007. On 23 April 2008, the Federal Council (the Swiss Government) amended the ordinance in order to strengthen its coercive measures against Iran in accordance with resolution 1803 (2008). Paragraph 3 The names of the 13 natural persons listed in annex I to resolution 1803 (2008) have been added to annex 3 to the ordinance. Annex 3 contains the names of the persons whose entry into or transit through Switzerland must be notified to the Committee. Paragraph 5 The new article 3 (b) of the ordinance states that the entry into Switzerland or transit through Switzerland by the five individuals listed in annex 4 to the ordinance is prohibited. The five people in question are those mentioned in annex II to resolution 1803 (2008). Paragraph 7 The Federal Council has added to annex 3 to the ordinance the names of the 13 natural persons and 12 entities mentioned in annexes I and III to resolution 1803 (2008) respectively and in doing so has submitted them to the freezing of assets and economic resources provided for in article 2 of the ordinance. Paragraph 8 Article 1, paragraph 1, of the ordinance states that "the supply, sale and transfer to the Islamic Republic of Iran of the goods, including technology and software, listed in annex 1 are prohibited". One of the amendments made to the ordinance on 23 April 2008 was to include in annex 1 the nuclear-related dual-use equipment, materials and software listed in circular INFCIRC/254/Rev.7/Part 2, which is contained in document S/2006/814. Complete unmanned aerial vehicle systems having the characteristics described in item 19.A.3. of document S/2006/815 have also been added to annex 1. Paragraph 9 Switzerland does not offer any public-provided financial support to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Swiss Export Risk Insurance (SERV), for its part, consults the export-control authorities in each case before insuring an export to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Such preliminary checks prevent SERV from unintentionally participating in transactions prohibited by the ordinance. Paragraph 10 Paragraphs 3 and 4 of article 1 of the ordinance prohibit the provision of financial services, financial resources or investments related to the supply, sale, transfer, manufacture or use of the goods mentioned in annex 1 and of all other goods which are destined or could be destined, in whole or in part, to the activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the areas of uranium enrichment, nuclear-fuel reprocessing, heavy water and nuclear-weapon delivery systems development. In addition, on 20 March 2008 the Swiss authorities, acting in conformity with paragraph 10 of resolution 1803 (2008), called on all financial institutions to exercise vigilance during their transactions with all banks domiciled in Iran, in particular with Bank Melli and Bank Saderat, and their branches and subsidiaries abroad. Paragraph 11 The Swiss authorities are authorized by law to inspect any Iranian or other aircraft found at a Swiss airport that are in transit to or from the Islamic Republic of Iran and are suspected of transporting goods prohibited under the ordinance. Lastly, with regard to paragraph 17 of resolution 1803 (2008), Switzerland wishes to inform the Committee that it has added to the ordinance a new article 3 (a) prohibiting the settling of Iranian claims arising from contracts that can no longer be honoured owing to the sanctions imposed.
