Tenth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names New York, 31 July-9 August 2012 Item 4 of the provisional agenda* Reports by Governments on the situation in their countries and on the progress made in the standardization of geographical names since the Tenth Conference (for distribution only) National report of Burkina Faso Summary** Burkina Faso's National Commission on Geographical Names was established on 13 February 1986 under the Ministry of Territorial Administration, Decentralization and Security. The Commission has not, however, succeeded performing its functions because of the lack of interest of its members, who have very little sense of the advantages of standardizing the geographical names of a nation. Aware of the obstacles and taking advantage of territorial mapping projects that are under way, the Geographic Institute of Burkina Faso, which spearheads all place-name activity in the country, has undertaken to relaunch it by including other institutions as well that might bring their expertise to the Commission. Some activities that will constitute the essentials of its next programme have as of now been identified. They include: :: The elaboration of a guide officially establishing the transcription system, the instructions for collection of data and the control criteria; :: The elaboration of a place-name glossary; :: The elaboration of a national charter governing action at the national level.
