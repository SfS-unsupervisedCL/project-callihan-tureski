UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL A/53/535 S/1998/988 22 October 1998 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH GENERAL ASSEMBLY SECURITY COUNCIL Fifty-third session Fifty-third year Agenda item 62 QUESTION OF CYPRUS Letter dated 20 October 1998 from the Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Upon instructions from my Government and further to my letter dated 19 October 1998 (A/53/527-S/1998/979), I have the honour to draw your attention to a new violation of the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus and of the flight information region of Nicosia by the Turkish Air Force, recorded on 19 October 1998. On that day, one B-200 turboprop aircraft of the Turkish Air Force entered the northern part of the Nicosia flight information region, violating international air traffic regulations as well as the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus, flying over the area of Mesaoria and landing afterward at the illegal airport of Tymbou in the occupied area of the Republic of Cyprus. In the afternoon of the same day, the same aircraft returned to the Ankara flight information region following a reverse schedule. As stated in my previous letters, such unauthorized intrusions into the Nicosia flight information region and the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus are in violation of international air traffic rules and, at the same time, they are in contravention of the provisions of the Security Council resolutions on Cyprus, which state that such overflights increase tension on the island and undermine efforts towards achieving a final settlement. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, I wish to strongly protest these new provocative acts by Turkey against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, which constitute a blatant disregard of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant decisions of the Organization on the question of Cyprus. These continuing overflights by the Turkish Air Force, as well as the presence of the Turkish military occupation forces on the island, constitute the underlying causes of tension in Cyprus. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 62, and of the Security Council.
