ENGLISH Original: Geneva, 20 November-8 December 2006 SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 6th MEETING Held at the Palais des Nations, Geneva, on Tuesday, 28 November 2006, at 3 p.m. President: Mr. KHAN (Pakistan) CONTENTS PROGRESS REPORT 1. The PRESIDENT invited the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole to give an update on the Committee's work. 2. Mr. COSTEA (Romania), Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, said that the Committee had completed its first reading of the draft final declaration included in the unofficial document that had been distributed on 24 November, for which he was responsible. The informal group tasked with coordinating consultations on the section of the final declaration relating to article X of the Convention had not yet finished its work. He hoped that he would be in a position to submit a new version of the draft final declaration that took account of delegations' observations and proposals on the other articles of the Convention to the next meeting of the Committee of the Whole. 3. The PRESIDENT said that, in addition, the Conference still had to consider confidencebuilding measures, proposed plans of action and intersessional work in an informal plenary meeting on Wednesday, 29 November. On the latter point, the representative of Argentina, having consulted all delegations, would submit a text at that meeting on an implementation support unit, and the representative of Norway would do the same for intersessional work carried out between 2003 and 2005. The two texts would form part of the third section of the final document. 4. Mr. BAEIDI NEJAD (Islamic Republic of Iran) said he hoped that the new version of the draft final declaration to which the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole had referred would take ample account of delegations' positions, in order to be able to proceed directly to negotiations on a compromise text. He requested further information on the consultations regarding the implementation support unit and intersessional work mentioned by the President. 5. The PRESIDENT said he was confident that the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole would do his utmost to present a new draft that took into account all delegations' positions with a view to reaching a compromise on the final declaration of the Conference. He recalled that the consultations on intersessional work had taken place and would continue to take place during informal plenary meetings that were open to everyone. He invited the representative of Argentina to consult with the Iranian and any other delegations interested in the question of the implementation support unit before reporting back to the informal plenary meeting on Wednesday, 29 November. The meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.
