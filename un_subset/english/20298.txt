Letter dated 7 August 2002 from the Permanent Representative of Denmark addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to draw your attention to the statement on Burundi, issued on 5 August 2002 by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union (see annex). I should be grateful if the text of this letter and its annex could be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Ellen Margrethe LÃ¸j Permanent Representative of Denmark to the United Nations [Original: English and French] Statement on Burundi by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union The European Union condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the new outbreak of violence against the civil population and, in particular, the recent indiscriminate bombing of the capital, Bujumbura, by armed groups. It shares the suffering of the entire population, which is being severely tested. Confronted by this insane spiral of violence, it takes note with confidence of the announcement of talks in the United Republic of Tanzania between the Transitional Government and the armed groups on the conclusion of a ceasefire. It again urges the latter to return to the negotiating table and urgently calls on all parties to embark on this process with the firm resolve to give precedence to peace and stability. It calls on countries of the region to cease all support for the military activities of the armed groups involved in the Burundi conflict. The European Union finally repeats its support for South Africa's efforts at mediation and the regional initiative for Burundi. It supports the undertaking by the countries of the subregion, in particular by the United Republic of Tanzania, to bring an end to the violence and to achieve a ceasefire at the earliest possible date for the greatest good of Burundi and the whole region.
