Implementation of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem: supply reduction and related measures Outcome of the high-level International Conference on Alternative Development Report of the Executive Director Summary The present document contains information on the outcome of the high-level International Conference on Alternative Development and the international guiding principles on alternative development, including the deliberations and recommendations of the Conference, as requested by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in its resolution 55/4. The Conference was held in Lima from 14 to 16 November 2012 and adopted the Lima Declaration on Alternative Development, including the International Guiding Principles on Alternative Development, contained in the annex to the present document. In its resolution 53/6, entitled "Follow-up to the promotion of best practices and lessons learned for the sustainability and integrality of alternative development programmes and the proposal to organize an international workshop and conference on alternative development", the Commission on Narcotic Drugs welcomed the proposal of Peru and Thailand to jointly host an international workshop, to be held in Thailand back to back with an international conference on alternative development among all stakeholders, to be organized in close collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In its resolution 55/4, entitled "Follow-up on the proposal to organize an international workshop and conference on alternative development", the Commission welcomed the inputs for the draft international guiding principles on alternative development, which were unanimously agreed by participants at the International Seminar Workshop on Sustainable Alternative Development, held in the provinces of Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai, Thailand, from 6 to 11 November 2011. In the same resolution, the Commission requested the Executive Director of UNODC to report to the Commission at its fifty-sixth session on the outcome of the Conference and the international guiding principles on alternative development, including the deliberations and recommendations of the Conference. As the first part of the International Workshop and Conference on Alternative Development, the Government of Thailand organized the International Seminar Workshop on Sustainable Alternative Development, in association with the Government of Peru and in close collaboration with UNODC, in November 2011. The outcome of the International Workshop, including the draft inputs for the international guiding principles on alternative development, was reported to the Commission at its fifty-fifth session (E/CN.7/2012/8 and E/CN.7/2012/8/Add.1). As the second part of the International Workshop and Conference on Alternative Development, the Government of Peru organized a high-level international conference, in association with the Government of Thailand and in collaboration with UNODC. The International Conference on Alternative Development was held in Lima from 14 to 16 November 2012 and included a one-day excursion to visit alternative development projects in San Martin province. Member States attending the Conference unanimously adopted the Lima Declaration and the International Guiding Principles on Alternative Development, which are contained in the annex to the present document. The inputs for the draft International Guiding Principles on Alternative Development were based on the draft inputs from the International Workshop in Thailand and the subsequent multilateral negotiations in Vienna, which were brought to the attention of the high-level representatives at the International Conference on Alternative Development in Lima.

B. Opening ceremony The Conference was opened by the Executive President of the Peruvian National Commission for Development and Life Without Drugs (DEVIDA), the Ministers of Agriculture and Environment of Peru and the Secretary of the Andean Community. The Director of the Division for Operations of UNODC delivered the keynote address on behalf of the Executive Director of UNODC. Delegates thanked the Government of Peru for organizing the Conference, including a field trip to Tarapoto, San Martin province, which had provided insight into successful Peruvian alternative development programmes. Delegates described the drug problem as a cross-cutting issue and a challenge for development, security, peace and health, among other things, and reiterated that it should be addressed through both demand and supply reduction measures. The principle of common and shared responsibility and the importance of international cooperation and alliances such as the Paris Pact initiative were highlighted. Reference was made to the three international drug control conventions, as well as the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/182. Delegates also shared experiences and initiatives in the field of drug control and alternative development in their countries. Many delegates described alternative development as an instrument not only for drug supply reduction but also for poverty alleviation, rural development, environmental protection and strengthening of the rule of law, among other things. Delegates referred to specific issues that they considered crucial for successful alternative development, namely, community participation and empowerment of the affected communities; schemes for social control; entrepreneurship; market access for products of alternative development; land rights and land tenure; the participation of civil society; and the integration of alternative development into the broader development agenda. Many delegates underlined the importance of having a set of international guiding principles on alternative development for use in designing, implementing and monitoring alternative development programmes. Some delegates stressed the need for a global seal or label for certifying products stemming from alternative development projects, including preventive alternative development projects, with the aim of opening new market niches. Delegates reiterated the importance and advantages of preventive alternative development in countries and regions vulnerable to illicit crop cultivation. C. Panel discussions During the Conference, experts participated in four panel discussions covering the following topics: role of the state in alternative development; competitiveness and markets; alternative development and the environment; and new trends in international cooperation for alternative development. During the panel discussions, the drug problem was described as a cross-cutting issue by a number of participants. There was agreement that alternative development needed to be conducted through a comprehensive, interdisciplinary and multisectoral approach. Many participants indicated that alternative development programmes needed to be designed, planned and implemented with a focus beyond rural and agricultural development and that they should take into consideration complementary development objectives, including health, education, rule of law and infrastructure (e.g. roads, electricity and water). Some delegates described alternative development as being an integral part of the social and economic development of a country. Participants also agreed that alternative development should be seen as one element of a broader drug control strategy and that alternative development programmes should be an integral part of the drug control policies and strategies of countries affected by illicit crop cultivation. Participants referred to the principle of common and shared responsibility as a key concept for international cooperation when addressing the drug problem and alternative development. In that connection, South-South cooperation was identified as an important mechanism to share best practices and lessons learned and to establish strategic alliances, especially among neighbouring countries. Participants discussed the importance of the role of the state through the provision of the needed framework and enabling environment, referring to economic, political and security issues, as well as public services, health and education, among other things. Panellists also emphasized that alternative development programmes should address gender inequality and the problem of violence against women. It was reiterated by participants that alternative development should be seen as a long-term process which needed long-term commitment by all stakeholders, as well as sustainable investment, strong political will and well-defined and transparent strategies. Reference was made to the example of Peru, where it took 20 years to establish sustainable and successful alternative development initiatives. Participants concluded that alternative development should be coupled with a change in attitudes and behaviours. Key factors in the planning and monitoring of alternative development programmes that were identified by speakers included the participation of and ownership by the affected target community, promotion of the full participation of national and local authorities, and civil society organizations, taking into account vulnerable groups such as women and young people. One participant indicated that governments and institutions should act as facilitators when providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development, with the idea of handing over full ownership of the initiatives to the communities. Local wisdom, knowledge, know-how and skills of the target community had to be seen as assets and the basis for the design and implementation of alternative development projects. With regard to products stemming from alternative development projects, participants mentioned the importance of promoting value-added products (instead of raw materials) to increase income for small farmers. Furthermore, the importance of a market-driven approach was highlighted: producers of alternative development products should adapt to the current and prospective market demand or, if possible, create new market niches. Depending on local realities, the focus should first be on local markets, and subsequently on international markets. In that sense, alternative development programmes should offer farmers and their organizations an opportunity to compete in the open market on the basis of product quality, rather than on the basis of charity or through a top-down approach. Participants agreed on the importance of understanding market dynamics and consumer demands when bringing alternative development products to the open market. It was highlighted by many participants that quality, consistency and adequate volumes of production were key factors for market access of alternative development products. Maximum use should be made of local knowledge and the social, economic, cultural and environmental advantages of the target areas. In addition, market research, media and the Internet were mentioned as crucial for the development of successful marketing strategies for alternative development products. The importance of establishing a certification or global seal for products stemming from alternative development projects, including preventive alternative development projects, was identified as one potential mechanism for gaining market access and establishing new market niches. With regard to environmental aspects, speakers agreed on the fact that environmental threats were caused directly and indirectly by the cultivation of illicit crops. Ecosystem degradation, such as deforestation, degradation of soils through the uncontrolled use of herbicides and fungicides, and monoculture, was highlighted as one consequence of illicit crop cultivation. The environmental impact of drug production, such as the dumping of precursors used for the production of coca paste and cocaine into rivers and on land, was also mentioned. Speakers pointed out that alternative development programmes themselves could have an environmental impact, owing to the construction of infrastructure such as roads, irrigation systems and warehouses, as well as through the introduction of new crops, sometimes in large areas, which could have a negative impact on ecosystems. Participants stressed the importance of further linking environmental issues with alternative development and incorporating environmental prevention measures into alternative development programmes, including the preservation of forests, sustainable use of timber and non-timber products, land titling and the role of indigenous people. D. Field trip to project sites The Conference included a one-day trip to Tarapoto, San Martin province, where the participants visited both a coffee cooperative and an agricultural research station. At the Oro Verde Coffee Cooperative, participants witnessed the coffee production chain. At the Institute for Tropical Crops, participants learned how laboratory research and development had been disseminated through farmer extension activities. In formal recognition of the strong cooperation between Peru and Thailand, a tree was planted by the Director for Promotion and Monitoring of DEVIDA and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board of Thailand. III. Outcome of the Conference Lima Declaration on Alternative Development The high-level International Conference on Alternative Development concluded with the adoption of the Lima Declaration on Alternative Development, including the International Guiding Principles on Alternative Development. The Conference requested the Executive Director of UNODC to include the Lima Declaration, including the International Guiding Principles, in his report to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its fifty-sixth session. The Lima Declaration may be found as an annex to the present document, with the International Guiding Principles on Alternative Development as an appendix thereto.

International Guiding Principles on Alternative Development A. General provisions 1. Alternative development policies are an important component of enhancing development in states affected by, or in some cases at risk of, the illicit cultivation of crops used for illicit drug production and manufacture, and play an important role in national, regional and international development policies and in comprehensive policies of poverty reduction and cooperation. 2. Alternative development, as an integral component of policies and programmes for reducing drug production, is an important, viable and sustainable option for preventing, eliminating or significantly and measurably reducing the illicit cultivation of crops used for the production and manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances through tackling poverty and providing livelihood opportunities. 3. Alternative development, including in some cases preventive alternative development, constitutes an international policy founded on the principle of shared and common responsibility that seeks to discourage the cultivation of illicit crops in countries affected by that problem and in those countries which are vulnerable to illicit activities. 4. Alternative development, which includes, as appropriate, preventive alternative development strategies and programmes, should be formulated and implemented by taking into account the vulnerability and specific needs of the communities and groups affected by illicit cultivation of crops used for drug production and manufacture, within the broader framework of national policies. 5. Effective alternative development strategies and programmes require, as appropriate, the strengthening of relevant governmental institutions at the national, regional and local levels. Public policies should be supported to the extent possible by, inter alia, strengthening legal frameworks, involving local communities and relevant organizations, identifying and providing adequate financial support, technical assistance and increased investment, and recognizing and enforcing property rights, including access to land. 6. Local communities and relevant organizations should be involved in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all alternative development programmes in order to truly reflect the needs of targeted communities. 7. Civil society can contribute significantly to the formulation of effective and sustainable alternative development programmes, and its active participation should therefore be encouraged in all phases of alternative development programmes. 8. An integrated and complementary approach to alternative development programmes and strategies is crucial and should be implemented in concert with broader drug control policies, including demand reduction, law enforcement, illicit crop elimination and awareness-raising, taking into account demographic, cultural, social and geographic considerations, as appropriate, and in line with the three drug conventions. 9. States should ensure the proper and coordinated sequencing of development interventions when designing alternative development programmes, and in that regard should take into account issues related to the establishment of agreements and viable partnerships with small producers, favourable climatic conditions, strong political support and adequate market access. 10. Alternative development programmes in the areas where crops are cultivated for illicit drug production and manufacture should be undertaken with a clear understanding of the overall objectives, as appropriate, of eliminating or significantly and measurably reducing the supply of drugs while promoting comprehensive development and social inclusion, alleviating poverty and strengthening social development, the rule of law, security and stability at the country and regional levels, taking into account the promotion and protection of human rights. 11. Alternative development programmes should include measures to protect the environment at the local level, according to national and international law and policies, through the provision of incentives for conservation, proper education and awareness programmes so that the local communities can improve and preserve their livelihoods and mitigate negative environmental impacts. 12. Alternative development programmes, including, as appropriate, preventive alternative development programmes, should be designed to address subregional and regional needs and should be integrated, when circumstances require, into broader regional, subregional and bilateral treaties and arrangements. 13. International cooperation, coordination and stakeholder ownership are essential for the successful implementation and sustainability of alternative development programmes. Alternative development should be considered by all involved parties as a long-term commitment whose results may require time to attain. 14. International cooperation programmes aimed at alternative development should take into account the experiences of different countries, including with regard to South-South cooperation, should draw on best practices and lessons learned in alternative development programmes and projects and should take into account the available financial and technical support provided by donors. 15. Alternative development policies, as one of the tools available in the fight against the world drug problem, should be implemented alongside efforts made by States to strengthen the rule of law and promote health, safety and security so as to ensure a comprehensive approach to tackling the challenges that may be posed by the possible links between drug trafficking, corruption and different forms of organized crime and, in some cases, terrorism. 16. Alternative development can be an integral element of overall development strategy and should complement economic efforts in the fight against poverty. 17. The impact of alternative development programmes should be assessed by taking into account their contribution to the control of illicit crop cultivation, including the eradication of such crops, and through estimates based on human development indexes, socioeconomic and environmental indicators and impartial and accurate evaluations. B. Actions and implementation measures 18. Member States of the United Nations, international organizations, regional organizations, development agencies, donors and international financial institutions, as well as civil society, should apply their utmost efforts, as appropriate, to: (a) Target illicit cultivation and production of crops used for the production and manufacture of illicit drugs, and address related factors, by alleviating poverty, by strengthening the rule of law and institutional frameworks, as appropriate, and by promoting sustainable development aimed at enhancing the welfare of the population;

(j) Promote coordination and encourage alternative development programmes which contain complementary measures at the local, regional and national levels; (k) Ensure, when considering crop control measures, that small-farmer households have opportunities for viable and sustainable licit livelihoods so that the measures may be properly sequenced in a sustainable fashion and appropriately coordinated, taking into account the circumstances of the region, country or area concerned; (l) Ensure that programmes or projects related to alternative development effectively discourage the illicit cultivation of crops used for the illicit production and manufacture of drugs; (m) Also ensure that drug control programmes are implemented in a comprehensive and balanced manner, so as to avoid the shifting of illicit crop cultivation domestically, as well as from one country or region to another; (n) Respect the legitimate interests and specific needs of the local affected and, in some cases, vulnerable population when designing and implementing alternative development programmes; (o) Address basic human needs, in full conformity with the three drug conventions and relevant human rights instruments, in order to promote the welfare of targeted communities; (p) Integrate those communities which are in marginalized regions into the economic and political mainstream; as appropriate, such integration should involve supporting access to roads, schools, primary health-care services, electricity and other services and infrastructure; (q) Promote increased coordination and cooperation between relevant governmental agencies, when appropriate, and adopt an integrated approach to drug control that involves all relevant stakeholders; (r) Ensure that the implementation of alternative development programmes is conducted in a manner that helps enhance synergy and confidence among national governments, regional authorities and local administrations and communities with regard to building local ownership and coordination and cooperation; (s) Promote the strengthening of the justice and security sectors and social development, as well as institutional legal frameworks and anti-corruption measures, in a manner conducive to enhancing alternative development efforts; (t) Promote governance capabilities, when appropriate, in order to strengthen the rule of law, including at the local level; (u) Ensure that measures aimed at strengthening the rule of law are included in development-oriented drug control policies in order to, inter alia, support farmers in their efforts to stop, and in some cases prevent, the cultivation of illicit crops; (v) Apply, in addition to estimates of illicit cultivation and other illicit activities related to the world drug problem, indicators related to human development, socioeconomic conditions, rural development and the alleviation of poverty, as well as institutional and environmental indicators, when assessing alternative development programmes in order to ensure that the outcomes are in line with national and international development objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals, and that they reflect accountable use of donor funds and truly benefit the affected communities; (w) Utilize objective impact evaluations that examine a broad range of social, economic and environmental factors and incorporate the lessons learned from these evaluations in future projects to ensure that the design and implementation of alternative development programmes are based on a reliable and evidence-based evaluation and thorough analysis of local socioeconomic, geographical and cultural realities, as well as the assessment of benefits and risks; (x) Undertake further research and strengthen data collection with a view to providing a basis for more effective and evidence-based alternative development programmes, as well as conduct research to assess the factors leading to the illicit cultivation of drug crops used for the production and manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; (y) Utilize data and conduct analysis to identify areas, communities and affected populations that are vulnerable to illicit cultivation and its related illicit activities, and tailor the implementation of programmes and projects to address identified needs; (z) Encourage partners in cross-border alternative development activities to consider measures to support the implementation of alternative development strategies and programmes, which may include special preferential policies, protection of property rights and facilitation of the import and export of products, in accordance with relevant international law, including trade agreements; (aa) Enhance technical support, including exchange of expertise, best practices and resources, while seeking to secure long-term flexible funding for alternative development programmes in order to ensure their sustainability; (bb) Consider the possibility of creating an international fund for alternative development programmes that could be used to face major emergency situations, in order to ensure continuity; (cc) Recognize that international cooperation resources for the implementation of alternative development programmes should be used in consultation and in coordination with partner countries to support joint efforts to eliminate, reduce and, in some cases, prevent the cultivation of illicit crops through reducing poverty and enhancing rural development in areas affected by, or in some cases vulnerable to, illicit cultivation and engaging in effective law enforcement measures; (dd) Recognize that long-term cooperation, coordination and the commitment of multilevel and multisectoral stakeholders are essential to a holistic and integrated approach to the effectiveness and sustainability of alternative development programmes; (ee) Consider voluntary and pragmatic measures in appropriate forums, with a view to enabling alternative development products to gain easier access to international markets, in accordance with applicable multilateral trade rules and treaties and taking into consideration the ongoing negotiation processes in the framework of the World Trade Organization.
