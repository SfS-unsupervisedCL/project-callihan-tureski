98-33457 (E) 061198 United Nations A/C.5/53/29 General Assembly Distr.: General 3 November 1998 Original: English Fifty-third session Fifth Committee Agenda items 73 (c) and (d) and 113 Review of the implementation of the recommendations and decisions adopted by the General Assembly at its tenth special session: Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters; United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research Programme budget for the biennium 1998–1999 Request for a subvention to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research resulting from the recommendations of the Board of Trustees of the Institute on the work programme of the Institute for 1999 Note by the Secretary-General Summary In accordance with the provisions of the statute of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) (see General Assembly resolution 39/148 H, annex, art. VIII, para. 3), the recommendation of the Board of Trustees of UNIDIR for a subvention of $213,000 from the regular budget of the United Nations is hereby transmitted to the General Assembly for approval. A/C.5/53/29 1. The Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters, in its capacity as Board of Trustees of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR), upon adopting the work programme for 1999 (A/53/187, annex II) and the 1999 estimated expenditures of the Institute, noted that for several years the subvention received from the United Nations had not been adjusted for inflation although salaries had been adjusted. The estimates contained in the present request differ from those contained in the work programme because time has expired since its issuance and due to the need to reflect as accurately as possible the estimates provided to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions by UNIDIR on the question of the proposed programme of work and proposed budget for 1999. UNIDIR has reiterated its continuing efforts to increase the proportion of administrative costs in tied contributions despite the continued scarcity of non-earmarked funds. It has highlighted the importance of the United Nations subvention and agreed that the matter should be kept under review. It has repeated its concern about the need to strengthen its core staff so as to reinforce its internal research capacity as well as sustain research commissioned externally, hence it is attempting to ensure that the subvention returns to its previous level and is adjusted for inflation. 2. The General Assembly, by its resolution 52/221 of 22 December 1997, appropriated an amount of $426,000 under section 2B, Disarmament, of the programme budget of the United Nations for the biennium 1998–1999 representing the United Nations subvention to UNIDIR for 1998–1999. Notwithstanding the inclusion of the necessary provision in the programme budget for the biennium 1998–1999, a formal request for a subvention for 1999 of $213,000 is submitted to the General Assembly, in keeping with established procedure. 3. Should the General Assembly decide to approve the recommendation of the Board of Trustees of UNIDIR, no additional provision would be required under section 2B, Disarmament, of the programme budget for the biennium 1998–1999. 4. Under section IV of General Assembly resolution 44/201 B of 21 December 1989, entitled “Subvention from the regular budget to the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research”, the Secretary-General is required to report annually to the General Assembly on the situation of the Institute. In that connection, it should be noted that the financial situation of the Institute is as follows: (a) Funds available at the beginning of 1998 amounted to $289,600; (b) Total income estimated for 1998 voluntary contributions and public donations ($1,259,000), interest income ($30,000) and the subvention from the United Nations regular budget ($213,000) is estimated at $1,502,000. The estimates reflect an increase of $849,300 against the initial estimates for 1998, owing to an increase in voluntary contributions. The details of revised 1998 and estimated 1999 contributions are provided in annexes I and II; (c) Total 1998 revised estimated expenditure is $1,236,600, which includes a provision of $50,000 for programme support costs. Requirements for 1999 are estimated at $860,200, inclusive of $30,800 for programme support costs. The breakdown of 1998 revised estimated expenditures and the 1999 estimates is provided in annex III; (d) Available funds at the end of 1998 are estimated at $528,000, including an operating reserve of $157,600.
