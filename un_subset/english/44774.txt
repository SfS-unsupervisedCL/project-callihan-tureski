Sixty-third session Agenda item 104 (b) Elections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other elections: election of seven members of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission Letter dated 19 December 2008 from the Permanent Representative of Ghana to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to refer to my letter dated 10 July 2008, confirming the consensus reached among the top ten troop-contributing countries that the following five Member States will represent the troop-contributing country category on the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission during the third session of the Commission, namely, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Nigeria and Pakistan. It is now my understanding that the question of the allocation of regional seats in the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council in respect of the membership of the Organizational Committee has been resolved, thus paving the way for the election of new members from the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council by Monday, 22 December 2008. This, therefore, comes to inform you that it has been decided that the terms of the aforementioned five countries from the troop-contributing country category of membership will be from 1 January 2009 until 31 December 2010. (Signed) Leslie K. Christian Ambassador and Permanent Representative (Troop-contributing countries facilitator)
