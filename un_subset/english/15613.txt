Letter dated 29 March 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Eritrea to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to attach herewith a press release entitled "Ethiopian mines responsible for incident with United Nations vehicles in Tserona", issued today, 29 March 2001, by the State of Eritrea, Commission for Coordination with the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the text of the present letter and its annex issued as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Ahmed Tahir Baduri Ambassador Permanent Representative Ethiopian mines responsible for incident with United Nations vehicles in Tserona Investigations into last week's mine incidents around Tserona, in which three United Nations vehicles ran over mines, have confirmed that the mines were laid by Ethiopia. The mines, which resulted in the injury of a Canadian peacekeeper, were Belgium-made PRB-M3 plastic mines. These non-detectable mines have never been employed by the Eritrean Defence Forces and it has been confirmed that mines of these sort were found in Guluj in western Eritrea, following Ethiopia's withdrawal from the area. Mine experts have now confirmed that Ethiopia laid these mines. Grave as this incident is, the danger of more such incidents looms large. In fact mine incidents in and around the areas that came under Ethiopian occupation are on the increase, with young children losing limbs to toy-like booby traps, vital watering holes becoming inaccessible, farmers losing livestock to mines and roads becoming too dangerous to travel. The confirmation that Ethiopian mines were responsible for the accidents in Tserona comes as Ethiopia continues to reject appeals to provide minefield information to the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE).
