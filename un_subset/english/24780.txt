The meeting was chaired by the Foreign Minister of Mexico, Luis Ernesto Derbez. The organizations represented at the meeting were the African Union, the Organization of American States, the League of Arab States, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The Secretary-General of the United Nations participated in the meeting. The meeting provided a valuable opportunity to learn about the experience of each of the regional organizations represented at the event, in particular regarding specific capacities, instruments for early warning, prevention, management and resolution of conflicts and possibilities for the exchange of information. The following issues were raised at the meeting: :: The fact that we are at a crucial junction in the development of international relations, in which there is a prevailing feeling of global insecurity and an equally strong desire to build a peace and security framework based on the international rule of law :: The complexity of the challenges and threats to peace and security, such as their transnational and changing nature and the fact that they are often interrelated, requires a collective security system that is capable of responding swiftly and effectively to such challenges :: A wide range of old and new challenges was identified, with particular emphasis on the proliferation of armed conflicts; terrorism and international organized crime; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and trafficking in small arms :: The need to pay attention to the root causes of instability and threats to peace and security :: The urgent need to find new ways of cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and regional organizations in the maintenance of peace and security, in order to be able to respond to those challenges effectively :: While it was recognized that regional organizations played an increasingly important role in the maintenance of international peace and security, the primary responsibility of the United Nations and the Security Council in this respect was reaffirmed :: Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be based on the principle of complementarity, so as to make the best use of the comparative advantages of each organization :: Cooperation should take place within a flexible framework but one that is consistent with the Charter of the United Nations :: The importance of working in partnership :: The need to develop a comprehensive and integrated approach to conflict prevention, management and resolution :: The importance of further developing the exchange of information and best practices experience between the United Nations and regional organizations but also between regional organizations themselves :: Efforts made by the African Union, ECOWAS and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) to enhance their capacity in the maintenance of regional peace and security were welcomed. At the same time, emphasis was made on the importance of providing international support to those efforts through training programmes for personnel as well as technical and financial support The following proposals were made at the meeting: :: To carry out on a regular basis a high-level dialogue between the Security Council and regional organizations :: To improve the exchange of information between the United Nations and regional organizations, as well as between regional organizations themselves, by making it more systematic :: To establish a global system to deal with current challenges and threats to international peace and security, with the United Nations as its coordinating centre :: To promote early coordination between the Security Council and regional organizations, especially before decisions that may involve or affect them are taken :: To convene an international conference on international peace, under the auspices of the United Nations, and for this conference to be preceded by regional meetings on the same subject
