The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1401 (2002) for an initial period of 12 months. The mandate of the Mission was subsequently extended by the Security Council in its resolutions 1471 (2003), 1536 (2004), 1589 (2005), 1662 (2006), 1746 (2007), 1806 (2008), 1868 (2009) and 1917 (2010). Pursuant to its resolution 1974 (2011), the Council decided to extend the mandate of UNAMA until 23 March 2012. 2. Following the holding of the Kabul Conference in July 2010, which resulted in the Kabul Process, and the adoption in Lisbon in November 2010 of a framework for transition to Afghan security responsibility by 2014 (inteqal), the strategy of gradual transition towards greater Afghan leadership and ownership in all sectors (security, governance, and economic and social development) agreed to by the international community and the Afghan Government continued to be further defined and implemented in 2011. 3. The year 2011 has seen and will continue to see a dense political agenda and a number of significant events that will continue to shape the overall transition strategy, the role of the international community in Afghanistan and its partnership with the Afghan Government, developments on the ground and the operations of UNAMA for the remainder of the year and 2012. 4. In January 2011, Parliament was inaugurated following the September 2010 legislative elections. In March 2011, President Karzai announced the first group of areas for transition to Afghan responsibility over security to take place starting July 2011. The identification of further municipalities and provinces for transition continued throughout the year. The High Peace Council, established in 2010 to promote Afghan-led peace and reconciliation, continued its outreach activities in Afghanistan and the broader region, conducting visits to numerous provinces in Afghanistan and to neighbouring countries. Regional initiatives to promote cooperation in economic fields and on security efforts and a political process are plentiful, with the Istanbul Regional Conference on Afghanistan held in November, and the Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Kazakhstan in June. It is planned to hold an International Conference of Foreign Ministers on Afghanistan in December, in Bonn, Germany. 5. In line with its mandate and the transition strategy outlined above, UNAMA and the broader United Nations system have focused, in coordination with international stakeholders, on capacity-building and on supporting national reconciliation efforts and economic and social development, including the promotion of human rights, governance and rule of law, in line with Afghan programme priorities and plans. 6. In accordance with the priorities set out by the Security Council in its resolution 1974 (2011), UNAMA and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan, within their mandate and guided by the principle of reinforcing Afghan sovereignty, ownership and leadership, will continue to lead the international civilian efforts in accordance with the London and Kabul Conference communiqu√©s and with a particular focus on the priorities set out below: (a) Promote, as co-chair of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board, more coherent support by the international community to the development and governance priorities of the Government of Afghanistan, including through supporting the ongoing development of the new national priority programmes, the mobilization of resources, the coordination of international donors and organizations and direction of the contributions of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, in particular for counter-narcotics, reconstruction and development activities, and at the same time to support efforts to increase the proportion of development aid delivered through the Afghan Government, and support efforts to increase the transparency and effectiveness of the Afghan Government's use of such resources; (b) Strengthen cooperation with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the senior civilian representative of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at all levels and throughout the country in support of the transition to Afghan leadership agreed to at the Kabul and London Conferences and the Lisbon Summit, in a sustainable manner to ensure the protection and promotion of the rights of all Afghans, in accordance with their existing mandates, in order to improve civil-military coordination, to facilitate the timely exchange of information, and to ensure coherence between the activities of national and international security forces and of civilian actors in support of an Afghan-led development and stabilization process, including through engagement with provincial reconstruction teams and engagement with non-governmental organizations, in particular through its participation on the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board as an observer; (c) Provide outreach as well as good offices to support, if requested by the Afghan Government, the Afghan-led process of peace and reconciliation, including through the implementation of the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme, and proposing and supporting confidence-building measures within the framework of the Afghan Constitution and with full respect for the implementation of measures and application of the procedures introduced by the Security Council in its resolutions 1267 (1999), 1822 (2008) and 1904 (2009) and others; (d) Support, at the request of the Afghan authorities, the organization of future Afghan elections, as well as supporting work on the sustainability and integrity of the electoral process, as agreed at the London and Kabul Conferences, and provide capacity-building and technical assistance to the Afghan institutions involved in this process. 7. In addition, in its resolution 1974 (2011) the Security Council reaffirmed that UNAMA and the Special Representative would continue to lead international civilian efforts in the following priority areas: (a) Support regional cooperation to work towards a stable and prosperous Afghanistan, building on the achievements made; (b) Through a strengthened UNAMA presence, promote, in support of the Afghan Government's efforts, implementation of the Kabul Process throughout the country, including through enhanced cooperation with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and facilitate inclusion in and understanding of the Government's policies; (c) Support the efforts of the Afghan Government to improve governance and the rule of law, including transitional justice, budget execution and the fight against corruption, throughout the country in accordance with the Kabul Process, with a view to helping bring the benefits of peace and the delivery of services in a timely and sustainable manner; (d) Continue, with the support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), to cooperate with the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), to cooperate also with the Afghan Government and relevant international and local non-governmental organizations to monitor the situation of civilians, to coordinate efforts to ensure their protection, to promote accountability, and to assist in the full implementation of the fundamental freedoms and human rights provisions of the Afghan Constitution and international treaties to which Afghanistan is a State party, in particular those regarding the full enjoyment by women of their human rights; (e) Coordinate and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance, in support of the Afghan Government and in accordance with humanitarian principles, with a view to building the capacity of the Government so that it can assume the central and coordinating role in the future, including by providing effective support to national and local authorities in assisting and protecting internally displaced persons and to creating conditions conducive to the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons. Partnerships, country team coordination and mission integration 8. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan is the official responsible for dealing with the situation in Afghanistan in all its aspects. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General ensures that both the Mission and the specialized funds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations support and coordinate efforts with the representatives and envoys of the Secretary-General that have mandates for specific areas of United Nations activities, including human rights through OHCHR, children in armed conflict (the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict) and drugs and organized crime through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 9. In accordance with the guiding principles of integration, the United Nations system in Afghanistan has developed an integrated strategic framework, which provides a common set of priorities to ensure that the United Nations system in Afghanistan functions in a multidimensional, coherent and mutually supportive manner to promote "delivering as one" that is consistent with Afghan priorities. 10. The coordination of the humanitarian and development activities of the Mission and the United Nations specialized agencies, funds and programmes is led by the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General/Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator. The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for Afghanistan 2010-2013 provides the basis for strengthening the alignment and coordination of United Nations programming with the Afghan Government. UNDAF and the integrated strategic framework also receive support from the Office of the Resident Coordinator in the pursuit of harmonized strategies for results-based management, the provision of specialist support to the collection and analysis of data and the formulation of evidence-based policy. 11. UNAMA cooperates closely with the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia (UNRCCA), in terms of the Mission's efforts to facilitate dialogue and cooperation between Afghanistan and Central Asian countries. UNAMA also cooperates with the Organization of the Islamic Conference and Economic Cooperation Organization to support dialogue to assist Afghan-led reconciliation efforts, counter-narcotics and socio-economic development with other member States within the region. 12. At Headquarters, the Integrated Mission Task Force for Afghanistan ensures that integrated, coherent policy guidance and support are provided to UNAMA. This mechanism promotes coordination, collaboration and information-sharing among UNAMA, the Departments of Peacekeeping Operations, Field Support, and Safety and Security and the specialized agencies, funds and programmes on issues such as the preparation of the report of the Secretary-General, the development of the integrated strategic framework for Afghanistan, and other issues relevant to the implementation of the mandate of UNAMA. 13. In terms of Common Security Management/Integrated Security Services, a security management team (UNAMA, the Department of Safety and Security and the specialized funds, programmes and agencies) coordinates security arrangements on a cost-sharing basis. Common services agreements are in place between UNAMA and other agencies in the United Nations compounds in Herat, Ghor, Farah, Badghis, Maymana, Kunduz, Fayz Abad, Day Kundi, Gardez, Khost, Tirin Kot and Qalat, as well as in the United Nations Operations Centre in Afghanistan (UNOCA) (Kabul). 14. Annex III provides information on substantive activities in 2011 of the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes working on programmatic matters (integrated, when applicable) in collaboration with UNAMA. Results of the Mission's organizational restructuring undertaken in 2011 15. In the light of the prioritization of mandated tasks in 2011 (Security Council resolution 1917 (2011)), UNAMA identified four priority areas in support of the overall role of the United Nations to assist the Government and people of Afghanistan in laying the foundations for sustainable peace and development. These "three plus one" priorities were support to elections, reconciliation and reintegration, regional cooperation and aid coherence. As approved in the budget for 2011, UNAMA has undertaken to realign its structures to better implement its mandated tasks. The overall benefit of the Mission's restructuring was to enhance the integration within UNAMA and the United Nations system. It has also contributed to reducing organizational fragmentation through the abolishment of the Analysis Planning Unit (formerly the Joint Mission Analysis Cell), and empowered the respective Deputy Special Representatives in their individual areas of responsibility to deliver upon the Mission's priorities. 16. The realignment within the political component (pillar I) has proved successful in both supporting the immediate priorities and laying the foundations in support of the reconciliation processes and regional dialogue. The establishment of the Policy Analysis Unit, under the direction of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (pillar II), which focused on long-term analysis, has allowed the Political Affairs Division to use existing resources for issues linked to ongoing developments, such as the electoral process and the implementation of the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme. The transfer of the two liaison offices, in Tehran and Islamabad, to pillar I has contributed to improving the planning and analysis by the staff in the Political Affairs Division that focus on regional affairs, with the aim of supporting political outreach activities and engagement in various regional forums, including the "Kabul Silk Road" initiative. In addition, the restructuring has improved the quality of the Mission's support to efforts of the Government of Afghanistan and the efforts of the international community towards the Kabul Process. By centralizing the aid coordination functions within the Office of the Deputy Special Representative (Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator), the Mission has been able to engage more effectively in the Joint Coordination Monitoring Board and promote the aid coherence agenda. At the provincial level, tangible benefits from the increased emphasis on aid coherence and the transfer of the Field Coordination Unit to pillar II have also been achieved, as demonstrated by the provision of support to the "deliver as one" initiatives, for example in Day Kundi. The abolition of posts linked to counter-narcotics and humanitarian affairs eliminated duplicated structures and contributed towards broader United Nations integration within Afghanistan. 17. In its resolution 1974 (2011), the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to conduct a comprehensive review by the end of 2011 of the mandated activities of UNAMA and United Nations support in Afghanistan, including the Mission's presence throughout the country, in consultation with the Afghan Government and relevant international stakeholders, with the aim of strengthening national ownership and leadership consistent with the Kabul Process, taking into account the evolving nature of the international community's presence and the role of ISAF, and including first experiences with the transition (inteqal), with a view to informing the review by the Council of the mandate of UNAMA in March 2012. Security considerations and results of enhancements undertaken in 2011 18. In the light of security considerations and the changing requirements of the minimum operating security standards and minimum operating residential security standards, several unforeseen security projects were implemented throughout 2011. The major projects consisted of the installation of heavy-duty steel sliding gates in all UNAMA premises and the construction of a safe room in UNOCA (Kabul) to mitigate against intrusions. Most of the security construction work related to security enhancement and replacement of major equipment is expected to be completed by the end of 2011. 19. Required security enhancement projects approved for 2011, such as construction of secure compounds in Kandahar, Bamyan, Jalalabad and Mazar-e-Sharif, the construction of safe and secure additional accommodation units for staff in those locations, including Kabul, and the reinforcement of other security mitigation measures at all UNAMA facilities, have been successfully completed. 20. As recommended by the Department of Safety and Security, UNAMA will continue to ensure safety and security throughout the country and, in conjunction with the United Nations country team and Headquarters in New York, will continue to undertake security and programme criticality reviews with a view to developing appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures. The cost of security for the Mission in 2012 is set out in annex II. Priorities for 2012 21. In the light of the above-mentioned mandated tasks, UNAMA has identified three priority areas in the overall support role of the United Nations to assist the Government and people of Afghanistan in laying the foundation for sustainable peace and development. The three areas in which UNAMA has an added value and is uniquely positioned to provide support, while ensuring that the United Nations system in Afghanistan "delivers as one", are as follows: (a) Facilitate an Afghan-led process for peace and reconciliation, at the request of the Afghan Government, by supporting national efforts, proposing and supporting confidence-building measures, and assisting internationally supported efforts in this area, including by engaging regional actors; (b) Contribute to the protection and promotion of human rights, including the protection of civilians and the rights of women and children, and promote efforts with regard to access to essential social services as part of the broader efforts of the United Nations to reduce poverty and improve the life conditions of the Afghan people; (c) Advocate and promote coherence of efforts in support of the Kabul Process and, as co-chair of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board, to uphold socio-economic development and Afghan national capacity to provide good governance and promote the rule of law; provide support to the transition (inteqal) process through its observer role on the Joint Afghan-NATO Inteqal Board to strengthen the transfer of responsibilities to the Afghan National Security Forces. 22. Throughout 2011 and in 2012, the political situation in Afghanistan is expected to remain complex. The tensions that were observed among the executive, legislative and judiciary branches at several junctures in 2011 could be detrimental to the effectiveness and inclusiveness necessary for Afghan institutions to further the transition process. 23. Afghan security forces have begun to gradually assume security responsibility, as per the announcement made by President Karzai in March. To be sustainable and irreversible, this will need to be coupled with progress in the Kabul Process, including the development of national priority programmes, and efforts to increase governance, capacity, and economic and social development. It can therefore be assumed that the holistic transition strategy that was agreed in 2010 and further developed in 2011 will continue to guide the partnership between the Afghan Government and its international partners in 2012. 24. It is also assumed that the Government's efforts to engage non-State armed groups, in accordance with the outcomes of the Consultative Peace Jirga held in June 2010, will continue. The coming months will be decisive to build and maintain momentum on this topic. 25. As for the security environment, this will likely continue to be volatile. The first part of 2011 saw a rise in the number of reported security incidents. The insurgency remains both aggressive and resilient in many areas. It is expected that the nature of the security situation will remain fragile in 2012, in particular following the traditional spring offensive. 26. The threat levels for the United Nations have been increasing in 2011. This has led to frequent restrictions of movement of staff and of operations. Public sentiments can be exploited by those wishing to influence, distort and disrupt political processes and/or the role of the United Nations as an impartial actor. The volatile and unpredictable nature of the threats the United Nations faces in Afghanistan were evidenced by the attack on 1 April 2011 on the UNAMA office in Mazar-e-Sharif by demonstrators, during which three international staff and four international guards were killed. It can be assumed that this security environment for the United Nations will continue in 2012. 27. In line with standard United Nations policies and practices and the request of the Afghan Government, throughout 2012 the United Nations will continue to strengthen its efforts towards "delivering as one", including through the UNDAF reviews and the implementation of the integrated strategic framework, while also promoting other initiatives to ensure the coherence of the work of the United Nations system in support of Afghanistan's socio-economic development. The midterm review of UNDAF will help ensure greater United Nations alignment with national priority programmes and the overarching priorities contained in the Afghanistan National Development Strategy. 28. The Mission's mandate and its prioritized activities described above, the organizational structure of the Mission and the related resources requirements outlined below may be revised as a result of the recommendations emanating from the comprehensive review requested by the Security Council in its resolution 1974 (2011), the recommendations of planned and ongoing security reviews, and other major changes in the posture of the international community in Afghanistan and its relationship with the Afghan Government that could stimulate correspondent changes in the posture and role of UNAMA in 2012. 29. Mission Support remains committed to providing efficient administrative and logistical support to UNAMA at large. Furthermore, to the extent possible, Mission Support remains committed to reducing operational costs by entering into common services agreements with other United Nations agencies. Existing multi-agency compounds in Herat, Islamabad, Tehran, UNOCA in Kabul and the UNAMA Support Office co-located with the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) in Kuwait are evidence of such success. UNAMA will continue to explore such cost-cutting opportunities in 2012. 30. The main changes planned for 2012 are summarized as follows: (a) Ground fleet. The fleet would comprise 490 vehicles, including 60 light vehicles, 14 medium vehicles, 3 heavy vehicles, 384 armoured civilian vehicles, 10 pieces of material-handling equipment, 2 armoured delivery vans, 5 vehicle attachments, 1 piece of airfield equipment, 10 armoured ambulances and 1 armoured VIP vehicle. With the completion of the acquisition of the final batch of armoured vehicles during 2011, no further requirements for the acquisition of additional vehicles is foreseen during 2012, other than one additional bus for up to 30 passengers to be used at the Kabul airport and the replacement of one light vehicle (4 x 4) for the Tehran Liaison Office. For the foreseeable future, UNAMA must maintain an in-house capability to service and repair the vehicle fleet, as Afghanistan does not yet have sufficiently robust capability to allow for outsourcing of vehicle maintenance and repairs; (b) Air fleet. The fleet would comprise five fixed-wing and five rotary-wing aircraft to airlift personnel and cargo to and from the regions and provinces in Afghanistan. The proposed composition of the fleet includes the discontinuation of one rotary-wing aircraft, reflecting scheduling efficiencies of the remaining air assets; (c) Communications and information technology infrastructure. A major upgrade of the Mission's communications and information technology infrastructure was undertaken in 2010 and 2011 to support the full implementation of the standardization and modernization plans, including the implementation of a disaster recovery and business continuity plan in the Kuwait Joint Support Office; (d) Office and residential accommodations. Mission Support will remain committed to the "field first" policy introduced by the Mission in 2007, as well as the "duty of care" approach introduced in 2010, which focuses on improving the living and working conditions of staff deployed throughout Afghanistan; (e) Energy and water supply. Afghanistan remains underdeveloped in the area of reliable and stable sources of electrical power. For this reason, all UNAMA installations are required to be self-sufficient in power generation and electrical distribution as well as in water supply and to maintain fuel reserves for the Mission's air and ground fleets and for generators. In practice, this requires that all sites have a primary generator, a secondary backup and a full complement of spares and fuel. All sites are therefore required to have their own independent source of clean water and means of distribution throughout the compound. Mission Support takes into account dependence on costly generator-supplied electricity and will continue to explore the feasibility of utilizing comparatively economic municipal sources of electricity when they become reliably available; (f) Staffing levels. The approved staffing level for Mission Support is 527 positions for 2011, including 462 positions deployed to Kabul and 65 to Kuwait. As a result of the proposed changes for 2012, the staffing level for Mission Support would comprise 549 positions, including 485 positions deployed to Kabul and 64 to Kuwait; (g) Vacancy factors. Mission Support will remain committed to expediting the process of recruitment of international and national staff. Furthermore, it will extend its full support to continuing an aggressive recruitment campaign in order to lower the level of vacancies in the Mission. The following vacancy rates are being proposed as part of the estimates for salaries and related staff costs for 2012: 30 per cent for military personnel and civilian police; 22 per cent for international staff and 18 per cent for national staff deployed throughout Afghanistan; 10 per cent for international and national staff deployed to Kuwait; and 11 per cent for United Nations Volunteers; (h) Training of staff. A comprehensive selection of courses and seminars are proposed to be conducted either in-house or in locations outside the Mission area in 2012. Training opportunities will continue to have a direct impact on the implementation of the Mission's mandate and on the morale, welfare, personal growth and career advancement of Mission staff; (i) Logistical support to the physical presence of the Mission. Mission Support will continue to manage and support the presence and operations of UNAMA in 23 field offices throughout Afghanistan (8 regional and 15 provincial offices) in addition to Kabul headquarters, which comprises 7 premises. 31. The UNAMA Support Office in Kuwait, which became operational during the last quarter of 2010, has been renamed the Kuwait Joint Support Office. Paragraphs 34 and 35 of A/65/328/Add.4 describe the factors taken into account for its establishment. 32. In paragraphs 10 and 13 of part XIII of resolution 65/259, the General Assembly: (a) encouraged increased cooperation between and among missions operating in the same geographical location with a view to achieving efficiency and cost-effectiveness; and (b) noted the intention of the Secretary-General to establish a support office in Kuwait for UNAMA, and requested the Secretary-General to explore possibilities for cost-sharing between UNAMA and UNAMI and to report to the Assembly in the context of his proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013. 33. Support arrangements at the Kuwait Joint Support Office, housed with UNAMI, have been reviewed by a team led by the Department of Field Support. The review resulted in a number of recommendations to improve the synergy and merging of activities. UNAMA is committed to working in conjunction with UNAMI and the Department of Field Support to actualize the recommendations in order to deliver benefits consistent with the goals of the Organization's global field support strategy. Extrabudgetary resources 34. On 21 January 2011, UNAMA signed a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS) with regard to the Mission's activities in support of the national reconciliation process. UNAMA provides technical and support services assistance to Afghan authorities, including the High Peace Council. As needs emerge, it is expected that UNAMA will be required to facilitate the rapid deployment of consultants with specific skills and expertise in support of Afghan-led efforts. External funding was deemed the most appropriate mechanism to address specific requirements in a flexible and time-sensitive fashion. The current funding to UNOPS is provided by the Government of Denmark. II. Mission mandate and planned results Performance for 2011 Expected accomplishments Actual results with focus on major indicators of achievement for 2011 (a) The socio-political environment is increasingly conducive to sustainable peace and stability :: Government of Afghanistan continued with the implementation of the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Programme. With the aim of assisting the development and implementation of the Programme, UNAMA engaged on a regular basis with all stakeholders on policy issues, including contributing to reviewing projects of the Programme as member of the Technical Committee;

under the action plan, the Government committed to the prevention of underage recruitment into the security forces and to addressing issues of sexual violence against children by security forces; prior to this, also in January, the Committee on the Rights of the Child considered the initial report of Afghanistan on its implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; discussion focused on how to improve coordination and Government ownership of the many laws, policies, strategies and programmes related to children (d) Increased effectiveness of development assistance to Afghanistan and improvement of Afghan institutions :: The Afghan Government, together with UNAMA, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Embassies of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America have been working diligently in support of the establishment of the Monitoring and Evaluation Committee in accordance with provisions of the London and Kabul Conferences; the Monitoring and Evaluation Committee, which comprises both Afghan and international representatives, met for the first time in May 2011 and will be responsible for developing clear and objective benchmarks for transparency and accountability, monitoring and evaluating activities conducted against corruption, promoting international best practices and advising government institutions on their respective strategies :: In support of more effective, transparent and accountable government institutions, the Civil Service Commission and the Independent Directorate for Local Governance have worked together to convert the status of Deputy Governors and District Governors from political appointees to civil servants; the new and transparent merit-based mechanism for recruitments have been supported by UNAMA and the newly selected Deputy Provincial Governors and District Governors have been observed to be more qualified to address their roles and responsibilities :: The implementation of the subnational governance policy, which defines the roles and responsibilities of elected and non-elected provincial institutions, has not been implemented in accordance with the anticipated timeline; the policy was expected to be implemented in a piloted phase by January 2011, but progress has been limited; UNAMA has worked to coordinate donor support to the process and is working to ensure respect for its provisions at both the national and provincial levels :: At the subnational level, UNAMA offices continued to work closely with provincial development councils, the Ministry of Economy and line ministry-led working groups to support coordination of provincial development planning and aligned support from provincial reconstruction teams and donors; UNAMA field offices held workshops in Kapisa, Parwan and Wardak Provinces with provincial development councils and sector working groups to enhance understanding of respective functions and relationships in coordinating the planning and delivery of development :: The Performance Based Governors Fund, which was initiated to enhance the effectiveness of the efforts of Provincial Governors and ensure adequate support for their operational requirements, was successfully implemented in all 34 provinces;

This follows on the London Conference held in January 2010. Agreed commitments include 103 governance, security and development benchmarks. Of the envisioned 22 national priority programmes in support of the overall benchmarks, 2 were endorsed in 2010 and 10 are currently undergoing consultation. There is an expectation that all 22 national priority programmes will be endorsed by the end of 2011. The Government has set up a reporting and monitoring process for the national priority programmes, with two rounds of 100-day progress reporting already completed. Owing to political/ technical obstacles stemming from the Kabul Bank crisis and its impact on the International Monetary Fund Programme for Afghanistan, the meeting of the Joint Coordination Monitoring Board for 2011 was delayed and is expected to take place in June or July :: The monitoring and evaluation policy paper and the Ministry of Economy strategy paper have been drafted. These two documents will be key to the proper integration of monitoring and evaluation in national programme papers and will be finalized at the same time as those papers. Sector results frameworks, which are the basis for the implementation of the Afghan National Development Strategy, have been finalized for all ministries. Information management capacity assessments have been completed in two line ministries. Those assessments are comprehensive reviews of monitoring and evaluation practices in the line ministry being assessed. More ministries will be assessed, which will feed into the creation of the overall monitoring and evaluation national framework Performance assumptions for 2012 35. The UNAMA strategic framework is fully aligned with the goals set out by the Security Council in its resolution 1974 (2011). The overall objective of the Mission in 2012, promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan, remains the same as in 2011. The Mission plans to contribute to attainment of the objective by reaching a number of expected accomplishments and by focusing its resources on delivering key outputs. Of the five expected accomplishments of the Mission in 2012 four remain the same as in 2011, with the exception of (e), enhanced implementation of the Afghanistan Compact and the Afghanistan National Development Strategy benchmarks, which has been revised to reflect the commitments from the London and Kabul Conferences. Overall, the indicators of achievement and related performance measures have been realigned to reflect the outcomes of key events in 2010 which have shaped the role of the international community in Afghanistan and its partnership with the Afghan Government. These events include the Consultative Peace Jirga in June, the London and Kabul Conferences in January and July, which generated the Kabul Process of transition towards gradual ownership and leadership of the Government of Afghanistan in all sectors (security, governance, and economic and social development), and the adoption in Lisbon in November of a framework for transition to Afghan security responsibility by 2014 (inteqal). 36. The strategic framework prepared by UNAMA stresses the need to link outputs to the expected accomplishments and the overall objective of the Mission in accordance with Security Council resolution 1974 (2011) and does not involve additional financial implications or increased resource requirements for 2012. Performance assumptions for 2012 are based upon the expectation that the Government of Afghanistan and the international community will continue to build upon the frameworks established in 2010. The monitoring and evaluation of performance measures continue to be carried out on a monthly basis by the relevant UNAMA programme managers and are encapsulated in the quarterly reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on the situation in Afghanistan. 37. In its resolution 1974 (2011), the Security Council has requested the Secretary-General to undertake a comprehensive review of the activities of UNAMA and United Nations support in Afghanistan, including the Mission's presence throughout the country. This review should inform the Council's deliberations on the Mission's mandate in March 2012. 38. The security situation and the deterioration witnessed in the first half of 2011 remain a significant cause for concern in terms of the performance accomplishments expected in 2012. The ability of the Mission to conduct outreach activities and engage with counterparts to achieve the expected objectives remains contingent on the safety and security of staff and facilities from threats in an increasingly fragile and volatile security environment. Any additional resources requested for 2012 in the present report are related entirely to the evolving security situation in Afghanistan.

Monitoring and evaluation 45. The Mission has compiled a series of benchmarks every year for inclusion in the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council that were linked to the International Compact. However, given that the Kabul Process has essentially superseded the International Compact, this process is expected to be revised, but it is expected to be influenced by the outcomes of the Bonn Conference in December. 46. Internally, Mission sections are expected to maintain portfolios of evidence with regard to their performance measures and report on key developments on a quarterly basis through the report of the Secretary-General. In addition, as discussed previously, there are a number of other frameworks, such as the integrated strategic framework, that contain various monitoring and evaluation commitments covering the Mission's activities. III. Resource requirements A. Total resource requirements 47. The proposed resource requirements for UNAMA for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2012 are estimated at $241,533,500 net ($259,451,700 gross), representing a net decrease of $15,855,100, or 6.2 per cent, as compared with the resources approved for the Mission for 2011, as detailed in table 1. Table 1 Total resource requirements (net) (Thousands of United States dollars) 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011 Requirements for 2012 Variance analysis 2011-2012 Appropriations Estimated expenditures Estimated unencumbered balance Total Non-recurrent Approved budget 2011 Variance Category Military and police personnel costs Civilian personnel costs 48. The variance between the requirements for 2012 and the approved budget for 2011 reflects decreased resources under the following categories of expenditure: (a) Facilities and infrastructure ($16,373,300), owing mainly to the completion of major security enhancement projects in 2011, including post-blast assessment works and relocation of regional offices, that will require no further major investment; the final payment of the Mission's share of the security gap project during 2010 and 2011, that will require no further provisions; and fewer number of field defence supplies as most UNAMA premises have been upgraded to meet minimum operating security standards and minimum operating residential security standards requirements; (b) Communications ($9,710,800), owing mainly to the completion of the Mission's communications upgrade project in 2011, that will require no major capital investment in 2012; an adjustment based on current actual transponder charges that are significantly lower than those incurred in 2011; the exclusion of transponder link charges between Kuwait and the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy; and the inclusion of adjustments (credits) for recoveries of charges for personal calls from staff members and telephone lines used by other agencies; (c) Information technology ($8,218,600), owing mainly to the completion of the Mission's major information technology upgrading project in 2010-2011, that will require no further major capital investment; (d) Ground transportation ($4,162,500), owing mainly to the completion of the acquisition of the final batch of armoured vehicles during 2011. Other than 1 additional bus for up to 30 passengers to be used at the Kabul Airport and the replacement of 1 light vehicle (4 x 4) for the Tehran Liaison Office, no further acquisition of additional vehicles is required; (e) Air transportation ($1,330,400), owing mainly to the discontinuation of 1 rotary-wing aircraft and the entry into effect in 2012 of lower prices for the rental and operation of air assets; (f) Quick-impact projects ($760,000), owing mainly to the temporary discontinuation of such projects in 2012 in order to assess the impact of various projects undertaken by the Mission; (g) Official travel ($286,000), owing mainly to a decrease in travel of staff for external training, as more training was arranged and conducted in-house; (h) Military observers ($197,500), owing mainly to the application of a 30 per cent vacancy rate to estimates for mission subsistence allowance and related staff costs, as compared with 18 per cent budgeted for 2011; (i) Medical ($121,200), owing mainly to the completion in 2011 of the acquisition of additional medical equipment for all Mission locations, in compliance with security enhancements for the Mission in Afghanistan that will require no further investment in this area; (j) Consultants and experts ($37,700), owing mainly to the reduced need for international consultants to travel to the Mission to conduct in-house training of staff; (k) Civilian police ($31,600), owing mainly to the application of a 30 per cent vacancy rate to estimates for mission subsistence allowance and related staff costs, as compared with 25 per cent budgeted for 2011. 49. The above decreases would be partially offset by proposed increased resources under the following categories of expenditure: (a) National staff ($15,212,100), owing mainly to upward adjustment to the salary scales for national staff, i.e., 10.7 and 3.1 per cent for National Professional Officers and 7.8 and 22.1 per cent for Local level positions, effective 1 August 2010 and 1 March 2011, respectively; and the application of an 18 per cent vacancy rate for staff deployed throughout Afghanistan, as compared with 32 per cent applied in 2011; (b) International staff ($9,521,500), owing mainly to upward adjustment to the salary scales for international staff, effective 1 January 2011; application of a 22 per cent vacancy rate for staff deployed throughout Afghanistan, as compared with 32 per cent applied in 2011; and the inclusion of a provision to cover a special allowance resulting from the implementation of the harmonization of conditions of service of staff; (c) Other supplies, services and equipment ($452,300), owing mainly to anticipated increases in freight and related costs, including payments for demurrage resulting from delays in clearance of goods for the Mission from customs, and increases in the cost of shipment of equipment and armoured vehicles within the Mission area; (d) United Nations Volunteers ($188,600), owing mainly to an increase in entitlements for Volunteers, such as living allowance, settling-in grant and repatriation expenses; and the application of an 11 per cent vacancy rate, as compared with 20 per cent applied in 2011.

Staffing requirements Table 2 Overall staffing requirements Professional and higher categories Subtotal General Service and related categories Total inter-national National staff United Nations Volunteers USG ASG D-2 D-1 P-5 P-4 P-3 P-2 Field/ Security Service General Service National Professional Officer Local level Approved 2011 Proposed 2012 Change Proposed overall staffing requirements 50. The total proposed staffing for UNAMA for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2012 is 2,558 positions, which would include 526 international staff, comprising 321 positions in the Professional and 205 positions in the Field Service categories, and 1,952 national staff, including 291 National Professional Officers and 1,661 Local level staff, and 80 United Nations Volunteers, as shown in table 2. Table 3 provides details of approved and proposed positions by location. Proposed abolition of approved positions 51. (a) The proposed reduction in staffing is owing mainly to the abolition of 26 international positions (2 D-1, 10 P-4, 10 P-3, 4 P-2) in order to accommodate provisions for a special allowance resulting from the harmonization of conditions of service of staff effective 1 July 2011, as approved by the General Assembly in its resolutions 65/247 and 65/248. Details of the positions proposed for abolition are provided in table 4; (b) In its resolution 65/248, the General Assembly decided that additional costs arising from the changes in the conditions of service approved in that resolution were to be absorbed by the Organization from within existing resources, without affecting operational costs or undermining the implementation of mandated programmes and activities. In deciding which positions to abolish, the Mission took into consideration those which had been vacant for some time or recently vacated, vacancies for which programme managers had taken no action, and those for which recruitment was on hold because they were assigned to high-risk locations. This exercise led to the identification of 26 international positions; (c) The functions of the positions proposed for abolition will be absorbed by the remaining staff of the respective units. The proposed abolitions would therefore have no negative impact on programme delivery of the respective organizational units. Proposed redeployment of approved positions 52. The staffing requirements for 2012 would also include the proposed redeployment of 63 existing positions among several Mission locations throughout Afghanistan and Kuwait, including 14 international positions (9 Professional and 5 Field Service), 35 national positions (3 National Professional Officers and 32 Local level), and 14 United Nations Volunteers. Details of the positions proposed for redeployment are provided in table 5. In the case of proposed outward redeployments, the functions formerly assigned to the redeployed positions will be absorbed by the remaining staff of the respective units. The proposed redeployments would therefore have no negative impact on programme delivery of the respective organizational units. Proposed reclassification of one approved position 53. It is proposed to reclassify one existing position in the Conduct and Discipline Unit from the P-5 to the P-4 level. Details are provided under the respective organizational unit. Proposed staffing levels for field, support and liaison offices 54. The proposed staffing levels are as follows: (a) The staffing component of the Mission's field offices would include 1,473 positions deployed to 8 regional and 15 provincial offices, reflecting the proposed abolition of 15 international positions and the outward redeployment of 1 international position, 12 national positions, and 6 United Nations Volunteer positions; (b) The staffing component of the Mission's Kuwait Joint Support Office would include 66 positions, including 2 Security Service positions, reflecting the outward redeployment of 1 international position; (c) The staffing component of the Mission's two liaison offices would include 5 international and 6 national positions, comprising 1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1 P-3, 2 National Professional Officers and 2 Local level positions in Islamabad; and 1 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 National Professional Officer and 1 Local level positions in Tehran; (d) The proposed movements of approved positions in the field, support and liaison offices are taken into account in the overall numbers mentioned in paragraphs 51 and 52 above.

It is proposed to abolish one position at the P-3 level, as described in paragraph 51. 66. The Security Council, through its resolution 1974 (2011), expressed concern about the security situation in Afghanistan, in particular the increased violence and terrorist activities by various groups. It therefore mandated UNAMA to provide political outreach and good offices, if requested by the Government of Afghanistan, to support the implementation of the Afghan-led reconciliation and reintegration programme, including through proposing and supporting confidence-building measures within the framework of the Afghan Constitution and with full respect of the implementation measures introduced by the Council in the above-mentioned resolution and in other relevant resolutions of the Council. 67. It is also therefore proposed to redeploy one position at the P-5 level from the Mission Planning and Report Writing Unit to carry out duties in the Liaison Office in Islamabad to enhance the regional cooperation ability of the Office, particularly in view of the increasing significance of the Afghanistan/Pakistan regional relationship, namely, its linkages to both regional political and security stability and socio-economic development.

The Unit was established in 2006 to achieve long-term dedicated capacity to address conduct and discipline issues in UNAMA. It also provides coverage to the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). The conduct and discipline team is an essential resource to enable heads of mission to discharge their functions and maintain good order and discipline in missions. The Unit also maintains records on all misconduct allegations and cases relating to all categories of peacekeeping personnel in the Mission, and liaises with investigative offices and Headquarters on misconduct allegations and cases. 92. One position (P-4) was reclassified to the P-5 level in 2010. However, based on the caseload, it has been determined that the P-5 level is not warranted. It is therefore proposed to reclassify the position from the P-5 to the P-4 level. 93. The Language Unit will continue to perform the functions described in paragraphs 152 to 154 of document A/64/349/Add.4. 94.

The Communications and Information Technology Section will continue to perform the functions described in paragraphs 184 and 185 of document A/64/349/Add.4 and paragraphs 157 and 158 of document A/65/328/Add.4.

National staff: inward redeployment of 1 position 110. The Geographic Information Section will continue to perform the functions described in paragraphs 198 and 199 of document A/64/349/Add.4. 111. The Section is responsible for the production of maps for the use of security and substantive areas of the Mission to undertake their activities. The demand to produce various specialized maps has increased over the years, necessitating the increase of staff of the Section. It is therefore proposed to redeploy one National Professional Officer from the discontinued General Services Section. Property Management Section International staff: inward redeployment of 4 positions National staff: inward redeployment of 10 positions United Nations Volunteers: inward redeployment of 3 positions 112. It is proposed to establish the Property Management Section, which would comprise the Receiving and Inspection Unit, the Property Control and Inventory Unit, the Claims and Property Survey Unit, and the Property Disposal Unit under the overall supervision of the Chief of the Section. 113. The Section would be responsible for the management of the overall supply chain process of the Mission from requisition, receipt, utilization, maintenance, monitoring, oversight, control, setting stock levels, developing cost-benefit analyses on United Nations-owned equipment, pruning surplus stocks, calculating consumption rates and establishing replacement cycles in order to optimize the inventory management of the Mission, as well as property survey, assessment and disposal. 114. The Section would also be responsible for implementing policies and procedures concerning the management of all United Nations-owned equipment, providing specialized inventory management support to the Mission, consolidating strategic management of property and training all stakeholders in the Mission supply chain system on the management of United Nations-owned equipment. Furthermore, it would assist the Chief of Technical Services to focus on the global management of the Mission assets management programme. 115. It is also proposed to redeploy 17 existing positions (1 P-4, 3 Field Service, 10 Local level, 3 United Nations Volunteers) from the discontinued General Services Section to carry out the duties and responsibilities referred to above. Facility Management Unit International staff: inward redeployment of 1 position National staff: inward redeployment of 14 positions 116. Owing to the deteriorating security situation and incidents revealing that the Mission is the direct target of various security threats, it was decided in 2009 to move all UNAMA staff out of private guest houses in Kabul and to house them in more secured United Nations-provided accommodation. As a result, the number of staff accommodations and various Mission premises increased substantially, requiring a dedicated unit to manage maintenance, improvements and distribution of accommodation and office space to the increasing number of staff served. 117. The Mission currently operates 23 field offices throughout Afghanistan (8 regional and 15 provincial offices), in addition to headquarters in Kabul, which comprises 7 premises, including the Central Region office. These compounds require management service that could draw on and coordinate with the resources of the Engineering Section, the Communications and Information Technology Section, the Security Section and the Supply/Fuel Cell Section to establish a suitable working and living environment for the staff, thus maximizing their productive capacity. 118. It is therefore proposed to establish a Facility Management Unit to be responsible for all matters related to the management of United Nations-provided accommodations and office premises, including managing the accommodation units, office availability and residential room distribution. 119. It is also proposed to redeploy 21 existing positions from the Engineering Section (1 Field Service), the Human Resources Section (1 United Nations Volunteer), the Kandahar regional office (2 United Nations Volunteers, 3 Local level), the Jalalabad regional office (1 United Nations Volunteer), the Gardez regional office (1 United Nations Volunteer), the Mazar-e-Sharif regional office (1 United Nations Volunteer), the Herat regional office (2 Local level), the Bamyan regional office (2 Local level), the Kunar provincial office (3 Local level), the Uruzgan provincial office (2 Local level) and the discontinued General Services Section (2 Local level) to carry out the duties and responsibilities referred to above. Office of the Chief of Administrative Services 120. The Office of the Chief of Administrative Services will continue to perform the functions described in paragraph 166 of document A/65/328/Add.4. 121. It is proposed to redeploy one position (P-5) from the Kuwait Joint Support Office. United Nations Volunteers Support Unit United Nations Volunteers: outward redeployment of 1 position 122. The United Nations Volunteers Support Unit will continue to perform the functions described in paragraph 150 of document A/65/328/Add.4. 123.

The Human Resources Section will continue to perform the functions described in paragraphs 201 to 212 of document A/64/349/Add.4 and paragraphs 167 and 168 of document A/65/328/Add.4. 125.

The Finance Section will continue to perform the functions described in paragraphs 214 and 215 of document A/64/349/Add.4 and paragraphs 169 and 170 of document A/65/328/Add.4. Procurement Section 127. The Procurement Section will continue to perform the functions described in paragraphs 217 to 222 of document A/64/349/Add.4 and paragraphs 171 and 172 of document A/65/328/Add.4. Medical Services Section 128. The Medical Services Section will continue to perform the functions described in paragraphs 224 to 228 of document A/64/349/Add.4. General Services Section International staff: outward redeployment of 5 positions National staff: outward redeployment of 17 positions United Nations Volunteers: outward redeployment of 3 positions 129. Until 2011, the General Services Section was primarily responsible for diplomatic mail and pouch operations, archiving and registry, claims and property survey, property control and inventory, receipt and inspection of goods and services, as well as the disposal of Mission assets. In addition, the Section was responsible for the administration of United Nations-provided accommodation, cleaning services of Mission facilities at five UNAMA locations in Kabul, the UNAMA commissary, and the provision of services by catering providers. 130. In accordance with Department of Peacekeeping Operations policy directives, in the interest of providing better supportive service to the Mission as a whole and of updating and streamlining the services provided previously by the Section, it is proposed to discontinue the General Services Section and to divide and expand its functions into three separate units, namely the Property Management Section, the Facility Management Unit and the Information Management Unit. 131. It is also proposed to redeploy 25 positions (1 P-4, 4 Field Service, 1 National Professional Officer, 16 Local level, 3 United Nations Volunteers) to the Property Management Section (1 P-4, 3 Field Service, 3 United Nations Volunteers, 10 Local level), the Information Management Unit (1 Field Service, 4 Local level), the Geographic Information Section (1 National Professional Officer) and the Facility Management Unit (2 Local level), together with their respective functions. The proposed discontinuation of this Section and the outward redeployment of approved positions would therefore have no negative impact on programme delivery. Information Management Unit National staff: inward redeployment of 5 positions United Nations Volunteers: inward redeployment of 2 positions 132. The Mission's complex data management requirement and the introduction of such online data capturing systems as Roadmap, Scorecard and Dashboard resulted in the need to have a dedicated unit to manage the large amount of data generated by UNAMA in order to ensure compliance with and the security and integrity of Mission records. Data management includes systematic management of paper-based records held for finance, human resources and other administrative functions. 133. It is therefore proposed to establish an Information Management Unit that would be responsible for all matters related to the management of information produced at UNAMA, including the development and implementation of a comprehensive records management programme at the Mission, and the application and/or improvement of information management policies, procedures and tools to support the mandate of the Mission. Furthermore, the Unit would provide records/information management and mail and pouch services for the Mission in support of the offices and their mandated activities, and would concentrate its efforts on proper management of active files, implementation of the mission-wide file classification scheme, management and appraisal of inactive records, as well as their proper disposal in accordance with Department of Peacekeeping Operations guidelines. In addition, the Unit would provide guidance and advice on the management of electronic records and the implementation of the TRIM electronic record-keeping system. 134. It is also proposed to redeploy nine existing positions from the Human Resources Section (1 United Nations Volunteer), the Kandahar regional office (1 P-3), the Office of the Chief of Mission Support (1 Local level), the United Nations Volunteers Unit (1 United Nations Volunteer) and the discontinued General Services Section (1 Field Service, 4 Local level) to carry out the duties and responsibilities referred to above. Staff Counselling/Welfare Section International staff: outward redeployment of 3 positions National staff: outward redeployment of 2 positions United Nations Volunteers: outward redeployment of 2 positions 135. It is proposed to discontinue this dual section and to establish two separate units in view of the complexity and wide range of the services provided until now by the Section. The specific functions carried out in the Section are therefore also proposed to be redeployed to the new units, together with their respective approved positions. The proposed discontinuation of the Section and the outward redeployment of approved positions would therefore have no negative impact on programme delivery. Staff Counselling Unit National staff: inward redeployment of 3 positions 136. The Staff Counselling Unit would be responsible for supporting the psychosocial well-being of all UNAMA staff in Afghanistan, including the provision of individual and group counselling interventions, emergency psychological services and follow-up to staff exposed to critical incidents, managerial consultations to all heads of United Nations agencies and technical advice to United Nations offices on stress mitigation and prevention strategies, as well as the conduct of training activities and psychosocial education to staff and managers, and the supervision of peer helpers and their activities. 137. It is also proposed to redeploy inwardly seven existing positions from the Language Unit (1 National Professional Officer) and the Staff Counselling/Welfare Section (proposed to be discontinued) (1 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 National Professional Officer, 1 Local level, 2 United Nations Volunteers) to carry out the duties and responsibilities referred to above. Welfare Unit National staff: inward redeployment of 2 positions United Nations Volunteers: inward redeployment of 1 position 138. The Welfare Unit would be responsible for the development of the UNAMA staff welfare framework and workplan, including coordination of improvements, maintenance and sustenance of UNAMA welfare facilities and regular welfare activities for the welfare and well-being of UNAMA staff throughout Afghanistan; the preparation and submission of quarterly and biannual welfare reports for the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Under-Secretaries-General for Peacekeeping Operations and for Field Support on the Mission's implementation of the policy directive and standard operating procedure on welfare and recreation approved by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations; and support to the UNAMA Welfare and Recreation Committee and the Regional Welfare and Recreation Committees. 139. The Unit would ensure that activities sponsored by the UNAMA Welfare and Recreation Committee are undertaken in a manner that respects diversity, benefits all categories of UNAMA personnel and takes into consideration the security-related rules and procedures established by the Committee. 140. It is also proposed to redeploy five existing positions from the Air Safety Unit (1 P-4), the Staff Counselling/Welfare Section (proposed to be discontinued) (1 P-3), the Baghlan provincial office (1 United Nations Volunteer), the Political Affairs Division (1 Local level) and the Military Advisory Unit (1 Local level) to carry out the duties and responsibilities referred to above. 6. Kuwait Joint Support Office Table 7 Staffing requirements for the UNAMA Kuwait Joint Support Office 141. The UNAMA Kuwait Joint Support Office is co-located within the premises currently occupied by the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). The Office was established on 1 January 2011 and was staffed by redeploying 67 existing positions, including 39 international and 28 Local level positions, from other various UNAMA locations. The responsibilities of the Office encompass the areas of finance and personnel, as well as aspects of travel, training, procurement, claims, budget and security. In addition, a disaster recovery and business continuity system is installed in the Office, expressly to support the UNAMA offices remaining in Afghanistan, and possibly elements of the Communications and Information Technology Section, in particular with respect to database management. A training centre is also in place to provide UNAMA staff with access to third-party regional training expertise in a cost-effective manner. Moreover, the Office also includes temporary office space for possible evacuees from regional or provincial offices located in areas that are suddenly designated security level 4 and who cannot be accommodated elsewhere within the Mission area, or from Kabul, in extremis. The Office is supported by the Movement Control Unit to handle cargo and passengers in transit. 142. Other Mission Support sections remain in Afghanistan and continue to provide programme support. They include the Office of the Chief of Mission Support, the Office of the Chief of Technical Services, the Air Operations Section, the Air Safety Unit, most of the Movement Control Section, the Surface Transport Section, the Engineering Section, the Supply/Fuel Cell Section, the Geographic Information Section, most of the Communications and Information Technology Section, the Medical Services Section, the Staff Counselling/Welfare Section, and parts of the General Services Section, including the Property Control and Inventory Unit, the Receiving and Inspection Unit, and the Property Disposal Unit. Despite the relocation of international staff to the Support Office, all Mission Support sections maintain a portion of their operations and international staff in Afghanistan to ensure the ability to plan effectively, manage client services and maintain accountability, as well as to manage the performance of the national staff in Afghanistan. Periodic visits to Kabul/Kuwait to monitor operations are foreseen by Mission Support section chiefs. 143. Mission Support staff redeployed from Afghanistan to Kuwait, who serve under units of the administrative services in Kabul, report to their respective section chiefs. Staff redeployed to Kuwait, who serve under units of the technical services or under the Mission's Security Section and the Department of Safety and Security, will continue to report directly to their respective chiefs. Under this arrangement, the Finance, Human Resources and Procurement Sections in Kuwait report to the Chief of Administrative Services through the relevant section chief. 144. The position of Chief of Administrative Services was approved to be redeployed to Kuwait in order to establish the UNAMA Support Office in that location starting on 1 January 2011. It is anticipated that the office in Kuwait will be converted to a UNAMA-UNAMI joint support office. In this connection, while many administrative service responsibilities have been redeployed to Kuwait, other location-specific functions have been developed. It is therefore proposed to redeploy the position of Chief of Administrative Services back to Kabul to assist the Chief of Mission Support in carrying out all aspects of management in Afghanistan. The proposed redeployment would have no negative impact on programme delivery of the Kuwait Joint Support Office. 7. Field offices in regions and provinces 145. Under the Bonn Agreement of December 2001, eight regional offices, in Kabul (central regional office), Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalalabad, Kunduz, Bamyan and Gardez, and two provincial offices, in Faryab (Maymana) and Badakhshan (Fayz Abad), were established. During the following years, 13 additional provincial offices were established, in Zabul (Qalat), Nimroz (Zaranj), Uruzgan (Tirin Kot), Farah (Farah), Ghor (Chaghcharan), Badghis (Qala-e-Naw), Sari Pul (Sari Pul), Kunar (Asad Abad), Baghlan (Pul-i-Khumri), Day Kundi (Nili), Khost (Khost), Jawzjan (Shiberghan) and Takhar (Taloqan). 146. In 2012 the Mission will operate 23 field offices throughout Afghanistan, including 8 regional offices and 15 provincial offices. Table 8 details the approved 2011 and the proposed 2012 staffing structure of UNAMA field offices in the regions and provinces. 147. The deteriorating security situation has had a negative impact on the ability of a number of the Mission's field offices to implement their programmes. Based on past security assessments, four provincial offices, namely Ghazni, Hilmand, Bazarak and Sharan, approved for establishment in 2009 and 2010, have been postponed. The staffing approved for these offices was abolished in 2010. Table 8 Staffing requirements for regional and provincial officesa International staff: abolition of 15 positions; outward redeployment of 1 position National staff: outward redeployment of 12 positions United Nations Volunteers: outward redeployment of 6 positions a Includes 8 existing regional and 15 existing provincial offices. Regional offices 148. The Mission has regional offices in Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Jalalabad, Kunduz, Bamyan and Gardez, with a proposed total staffing strength of 818 positions, as detailed in table 9 below. Table 9 Staffing requirements for regional offices International staff: abolition of 10 positions outward redeployment of 1 position National staff: outward redeployment of 7 positions United Nations Volunteers: outward redeployment of 5 positions and related categories Professional Officer 149. The following tables provide details of the proposed staffing structure of each regional office, including proposed abolitions and outward redeployments. 150. It is proposed to abolish 10 international positions in regional offices (3 P-4, 6 P-3, 1 P-2) in order to cover the cost of a special allowance resulting from the harmonization of conditions of service of staff effective 1 July 2011, as approved by the General Assembly in resolutions 65/247 and 65/248. 151. It is also proposed to redeploy 13 positions in regional offices to the newly established Facility Management Unit (5 United Nations Volunteers, 7 Local level) and to the Information Management Unit (1 P-3). 152. As mentioned in paragraphs 51 and 52, the functions formerly assigned to the aforementioned positions within their respective regional offices would be absorbed by the remaining staff of those units. The proposed abolitions and redeployments would therefore have no negative impact on programme delivery of the respective regional offices. Kabul regional office -- central region and related categories Kandahar regional office -- southern region National staff: outward redeployment of 3 positions Herat regional office Mazar-e-Sharif regional office Jalalabad regional office Kunduz regional office Bamyan regional office Gardez regional office -- south-eastern region Provincial offices 153. The Mission has 15 provincial offices, in Badakhshan, Faryab, Badghis, Nimroz, Farah, Ghor, Day Kundi, Zabul, Uruzgan, Khost, Kunar, Sari Pul, Jawzjan, Takhar and Baghlan, with a proposed total staffing strength of 655 positions, as detailed in table 10 below. Table 10 Staff requirements for provincial offices International staff: abolition of 5 positions National staff: outward redeployment of 5 positions 154. The following tables provide details of the proposed staffing structure of each provincial office, including proposed abolitions and outward redeployments. 155. It is proposed to abolish five international positions in provincial offices (1 P-4, 1 P-3, 3 P-2) in order to cover the cost of a special allowance resulting from the harmonization of conditions of service of staff, effective 1 July 2011, as approved by the General Assembly in resolutions 65/247 and 65/248. 156. It is also proposed to redeploy six positions in provincial offices to the newly established Facility Management Unit (5 Local level) and to the Welfare Unit (1 United Nations Volunteer). 157. As referred to in paragraphs 51 and 52 above, the functions formerly assigned to the aforementioned positions within their respective provincial offices will be absorbed by the remaining staff of those units. The proposed abolitions and redeployments would therefore have no negative impact on programme delivery of the respective provincial offices. Zabul (Qalat) (under the Kandahar regional office/southern region) Nimroz (Zaranj) (under the Kandahar regional office/southern region) Uruzgan (Tirin Kot) (under the Kandahar regional office/southern region) Ghor (Chaghcharan) (under the Herat regional office/western region) Badghis (Qala-e-Naw) (under the Herat regional office/western region) Farah (Farah) (under the Herat regional office/western region) Faryab (Maymana) (under the Mazar-e-Sharif regional office/northern region) Sari Pul (Sari Pul) (under the Mazar-e-Sharif regional office/northern region) Jawzjan (Shiberghan) (under the Mazar-e-Sharif regional office/northern region) Kunar (Asad Abad) (under the Jalalabad regional office/eastern region) Badakhshan (Fayz Abad) (under the Kunduz regional office/north-eastern region) Baghlan (Pul-i-Khumri) (under the Kunduz regional office/north-eastern region) Takhar (Taloqan) (under the Kunduz regional office/north-eastern region) Day Kundi (Nili) (under the Bamyan regional office/central highlands region) Khost (Khost) (under the Gardez regional office/south-eastern region) IV.

Military and police personnel expenditures requirements Approved budget 2011 Military observers 158. The provision of $986,600 reflects requirements for the deployment of 1 military adviser and 27 military liaison officers with respect to: (a) Mission subsistence allowance, based on standard rates of $142 per day for the first 30 days of emplacement, and $108 per day for the remaining days of the year, including an estimated vacancy rate of 30 per cent ($792,600); (b) Travel costs for placement, rotation and repatriation, including commercial airfare, personal effects and terminal and ground expenses, at an average cost of $7,500 per person. Incoming travel is estimated at $4,500 for 20 emplacement trips and outgoing travel at $3,000 for 20 repatriation trips, taking into account an estimated vacancy rate of 30 per cent ($150,000); (c) Clothing allowance, based on a standard rate of $200 per person per year, taking into account an estimated vacancy rate of 30 per cent ($4,000); (d) Death and disability compensation, based on a standard rate applicable to military strength under 100 ($40,000). 159. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects the application of a 30 per cent vacancy rate to estimates for salaries and related staff costs, as compared to 18 per cent budgeted for 2011. 160. The anticipated unencumbered balance in 2010-2011 relates mainly to a lower than anticipated deployment of military liaison officers, which reflects a temporary ceiling implemented by the Mission for the deployment of officers until safe and secure accommodations were made available. The actual deployment of officers would result in an anticipated vacancy rate of 54 per cent, compared to the budgeted rate of 18 per cent. Civilian police 161. The provision of $312,700 reflects requirements for the deployment of eight Civilian Police Advisers with respect to: (a) Mission subsistence allowance, based on standard rates of $142 per day for the first 30 days of emplacement, and $108 per day for the remaining days of the year, including an estimated vacancy rate of 30 per cent ($226,500); (b) Travel costs for placement, rotation and repatriation, including commercial airfare, personal effects and terminal and ground expenses, at an average cost of $7,500 per person. Incoming travel is calculated at $4,500 for eight emplacement trips and outgoing travel is calculated at $3,000 for six repatriation trips, taking into account an estimated vacancy rate of 30 per cent ($45,000); (c) Clothing allowance, based on a standard rate of $200 per person per year, taking into account an estimated vacancy rate of 30 per cent ($1,200); 162. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects the application of a 30 per cent vacancy rate to estimates for salaries and related staff costs, as compared to 25 per cent budgeted for 2011. 163. The anticipated unencumbered balance in 2010-2011 relates mainly to a lower than anticipated deployment of civilian police advisers owing to the vacancy of the Chief of the Civilian Police Advisory Unit, who is responsible for recruiting the civilian police, for a long period, thus resulting in an anticipated vacancy rate of 69 per cent, compared to the budgeted rate of 25 per cent. B. Civilian personnel International staff 164. The provision of $74,229,800 reflects requirements for salaries ($25,412,200), common staff costs ($37,816,800), hazardous duty station allowances ($5,403,200) and a special allowance resulting from the harmonization of conditions of service of staff ($5,597,600) for 526 international positions, including 321 Professional and 205 Field Service staff. The cost estimates include a vacancy rate of 22 per cent for international staff deployed to all locations throughout Afghanistan (488 positions) and 10 per cent for staff deployed to the Kuwait Joint Support Office (38 positions). 165. The proposed international staffing for 2012 would include: (a) The proposed abolition of 26 positions, as detailed in table 4; (b) The proposed redeployment of 14 positions, including 9 international and 5 Field Service positions, as detailed in table 5; (c) The proposed downwards reclassification of one position from the P-5 to the P-4 level in the Conduct and Discipline Unit, as described in paragraph 92. 166. The provision for allowances also includes vacancy rates of 22 and 10 per cent, applicable to staff deployed to Afghanistan and Kuwait, respectively, and would cover: (a) Compensation for service under hazardous conditions budgeted at $1,365 per month per international staff for 10 months, taking into account the rest and recuperation entitlement during which entitlement to compensation for service is not payable to staff. This entitlement is not payable to international staff deployed to Kuwait; (b) Residential security measures to ensure compliance with the minimum operating security standards, which include two components, a one-time payment up to $3,000 per international staff for security installation and a recurrent reimbursement of 100 per cent of the cost of hiring security guards. It is estimated that a one-time payment of 30 security installations and the same number of recurrent monthly payments for security guards will be made by UNAMA to staff members in various regions and provinces; (c) Premiums for malicious acts insurance to provide coverage to international staff and consultants on official travel to the Mission area; (d) Special allowance resulting from the harmonization of conditions of service of staff, which includes new payments for second household allowance, additional hardship for non-family duty station, assignment grant and installation of dependants. 167. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget reflects mainly: (a) Increases in salary scales for international staff, effective 1 January 2011; (b) The application of a 22 per cent vacancy rate for staff deployed throughout Afghanistan, as compared to 32 per cent applied in 2011; (c) The inclusion of a provision to cover the cost of a special allowance resulting from the harmonization of conditions of service of staff, effective 1 July 2011. 168. The foregoing would be offset in part by the proposed abolition of 26 international positions in order to cover the cost of a special allowance resulting from the harmonization of conditions of service of staff, effective 1 July 2011, and decreased requirements for hazardous duty station allowance resulting from a change in rate from $2,000 to $1,365 per month. 169. The anticipated additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 relate to an increase in the salary scale for international staff, effective 1 January 2011, an anticipated average vacancy rate of 21 per cent compared to the budgeted rate of 32 per cent and changes in relation to common staff costs, that is, 86 per cent compared to the budgeted 65 per cent. The vacancy rate for international staff is expected to decrease further by 31 December 2011 and remain stable at that level throughout 2012 as a result of the completion of the construction of security enhanced staff accommodations and the introduction of the Field Central Review Board roster. 170. The provision of $47,089,400 reflects requirements for salaries ($30,779,800), common staff costs ($7,691,900), overtime ($339,200) and hazardous duty station allowance, including compensation for hazardous conditions, residential security allowance and malicious act insurance ($8,278,500) for 1,952 national staff positions, including 291 National Professional Officers and 1,661 Local level positions. The cost estimates include a vacancy rate of 18 per cent for national staff deployed to all locations in Afghanistan (1,924 positions, including 291 National Professional Officers and 1,633 Local level positions) and 10 per cent for staff deployed to Kuwait (28 Local level positions). 171. The national staffing for 2012 would include the proposed redeployment of 35 national positions throughout various Mission locations in Afghanistan, including 3 National Professional Officers and 32 Local level positions, as detailed in table 5. 172. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget reflects mainly increases in local salaries by 10.7 per cent for National Professional Officers and 7.8 per cent for Local level positions, effective 1 August 2010, and 3.1 per cent for National Professional Officers and 22.1 per cent for Local level positions, effective 1 March 2011, and the application of an 18 per cent vacancy rate for staff deployed throughout Afghanistan, as compared to 32 per cent applied in 2011. 173. The anticipated net additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 relate to: (a) Increases in local salaries by 10.7 per cent for National Professional Officers and 7.8 per cent for Local level positions, effective 1 August 2010, and 3.1 per cent for National Professional Officers and 22.1 per cent for Local level positions, effective 1 March 2011, and to anticipated average vacancy rates of 24 per cent and 9 per cent for National Professional Officers and Local level positions, respectively, compared to the estimated budgeted rate of 32 per cent for national staff deployed to Mission locations throughout Afghanistan. The vacancy rate for national staff is expected to further decrease by 31 December 2011 and remain stable at that level throughout 2012 as a result of the Mission's aggressive recruitment campaign undertaken in 2011; (b) A provision for overtime payable to national staff drivers who are expected to report to duty at least one hour prior to the commencement of business hours to pick up office staff and stay one hour after the close of business hours to drop them off. In addition, international staff members and senior managers who normally work or attend meetings beyond office hours must be accompanied by drivers, as Mission vehicles are not to be left unattended owing to the continued deterioration of the security situation in the country. 174. The foregoing would be offset in part by the anticipated net unencumbered balance related to hazardous duty station allowance. 175. The provision of $3,405,300 reflects requirements for the deployment of 80 United Nations Volunteers to cover monthly living allowance, settling-in grant, travel on assignment and repatriation, insurance and training as well as other entitlements. It also includes the programme support cost due to the United Nations Volunteers headquarters in Bonn, Germany, at the rate of 8 per cent of the total United Nations Volunteers costs. The cost estimates include a vacancy rate of 11 per cent. 176. The United Nations Volunteers staffing for 2012 would include the proposed redeployment of 14 Volunteers throughout various Mission locations in Afghanistan, as detailed in table 5. 177. The net variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget reflects mainly an increase in Volunteer entitlements, such as Volunteer living allowance, settling-in grant and repatriation expense, and the application of an 11 per cent vacancy rate as compared to 20 per cent applied in 2011, offset in part by a reduced rate for hazardous duty station allowance applicable to United Nations Volunteers, resulting from a change in the budgeted rate from $800 applied in 2011 to $546 applied for 2012. 178. The anticipated additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 relate to an anticipated vacancy rate of 19 per cent, compared to the budgeted rate of 20 per cent. Furthermore, as a new contractual requirement for United Nations Volunteers of 12 months is expected to result in less frequent movement of Volunteers, the vacancy rate for Volunteers would decrease further by 31 December 2011 and remain stable at that level throughout 2012. C. Operational costs Consultants and experts 179. The provision of $378,400 reflects requirements for consultancy services to undertake: (a) Non-training activities ($180,300) to assist: (i) The Mission's Strategic Communications and Spokesperson Unit to undertake short assignments in areas of the country that are out of reach for UNAMA staff owing to the continued deterioration of the security situation in the country; to carry out a qualitative survey sampling on Afghan perceptions of UNAMA in order to enable the United Nations to position itself and to help target public communications so as to contribute to a higher level of security for United Nations personnel and programmes in Afghan communities; and to carry out monitoring and evaluation of the Unit's outputs; (ii) The Mission to implement recommendations issued by the Kuwait review team in relation to the streamlining of work processes and synergies; (b) Training activities ($198,100), including courses in train the trainers, best practices, procurement, finance, transport, engineering, property management, communications and information technology, security, journalism, human rights, the rule of law, transitional justice and air safety operations, management, language skills and security awareness. The provision includes the training of international and national staff within and outside the Mission area. 180. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget reflects mainly the reduced engagement of international consultants to travel to the Mission to conduct in-house training of staff. 181. The anticipated additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 relate to the engagement of a higher number of consultants to conduct training activities for Mission staff. Official travel 182. The provision of $2,084,000 reflects requirements for official travel to undertake non-training ($1,446,200) and training activities ($637,800). 183. The proposed requirements for official travel of staff for non-training activities include travel within and outside the Mission area, as follows: (a) Travel within the Mission area includes travel of staff of Mission Support and of heads of regional offices, including the liaison offices in Islamabad and Tehran, to attend regular monthly meetings with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and senior management of the Mission. In addition, travel within the Mission area is required in order to provide essential technical support to regional and provincial offices and to ensure that regular programme consultation takes place among the various components of the Mission to achieve the efficient implementation of its mandate. Moreover, the provision would cover travel of staff between Kabul and the Kuwait Joint Support Office for consultations and support to meet the surge in activities in both locations; (b) Travel outside the Mission area includes official travel of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and members of his senior staff in connection with the implementation of the Mission's mandate and to visit and hold meetings with donor countries in their capital cities; official travel for consultations with political counterparts and the provision of briefings to the Security Council in New York; and the official travel of staff to conferences, seminars, workshops and consultations. 184. The proposed requirements for official travel of staff for training-related activities include travel to attend technical training outside the Mission area. 185. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects a lower level of travel for external training of staff, as more training would be arranged and conducted in-house. 186. The anticipated net unencumbered balance in the biennium 2010-2011 relates mainly to the reduced number of trips undertaken by staff to attend training-related activities, offset in part by projected additional requirements related to trips undertaken by the Mission's senior management and the relocation of staff to Kuwait. Facilities and infrastructure 187. The provision of $40,886,800 reflects requirements for facilities and infrastructure, including: (a) Acquisitions valued at $4,560,300, including freight charges, of: (i) Miscellaneous facilities and infrastructure, including engineering tools and equipment to construct, repair and maintain various engineering assets to be used by the Building Management Unit, the Generator Unit and for heating, ventilation and air conditioning. The provision includes the acquisition of two mobile aviation fuel filtration units to ensure the quality of fuel utilized in UNAMA aircraft ($461,400); (ii) Refrigeration equipment to enable the replacement of 249 units owing to normal wear and tear ($129,300); (iii) Generators to be used as backup ($175,100); (iv) Water and septic tanks ($64,700); (v) Accommodation equipment to furnish United Nations-provided accommodation units, including items identified by the Security Section to provide accommodation equipment to non-UNAMA security personnel, including the Afghan Protection Services and the International Armed Guards deployed to various Mission locations ($325,900); (vi) Fuel tanks to be installed in three field offices and fuel storage pumps to establish a local reserve capacity in all Mission locations in Kabul and selected field offices ($296,400); (vii) Office furniture to replace some existing furniture as a result of normal wear and tear ($395,400); (viii) Office equipment, including security-related items, to replace some existing equipment as a result of normal wear and tear ($350,300); (ix) Security and safety equipment to replace equipment that has reached the end of its economic life in all Mission locations throughout Afghanistan and the acquisition of additional closed-circuit television systems, ballistic vests and helmets, and luggage X-ray machines ($2,361,800); (b) Rental of premises, including at headquarters in Kabul, offices in eight regions and offices in the provinces of Zabul, Ghor, Faryab, Kunar, Badakshan, Day Kundi, Khost, Nimroz, Uruzgan, Baghlan, Badghis, Sari Pul, Ghazni, Farah, Jawzjan and Takhar; two liaison offices, one in Islamabad and the other in Tehran; and a logistics support office in Dubai, through a variety of contractual and/or cost-sharing agreements. Some of the offices are free of charge, including the offices in Kuwait, Jalalabad, Tirin Kot (Uruzgan), Khost, Kunar, Ghazni and Hilmand. Other premises are rented through a common services cost-sharing arrangement, such as the premises at the UNOCA complex and offices in Islamabad, Herat, Qalat and Tehran. The provision also covers the rental of buildings to provide office and residential accommodation to all international staff based in Kunduz, Pul-i-Khumri, Ghor, Badghis and Sari Pul, which are considered UNAMA-provided accommodation. In addition, the provision covers rental of plots where the Alpha compound is built and used for office and residential purposes ($4,095,100); (c) Utilities, which would cover water-supply requirements in the Nimroz provincial office, and city-supplied electricity for the Herat regional office, which is under a cost-sharing agreement, the Qallai Fatullah facility and the UNAMA airport terminal. Other Mission locations throughout the country do not incur this expense ($79,800); (d) Maintenance, cleaning and waste-disposal services, including hazardous waste, and the cost of casual labour of electricians and plumbers, and for sewage, cleaning and other building maintenance services for all Mission locations ($2,224,600). The provision would include: (i) The Mission's share of the cost (including rental) for the premises occupied by administrative offices in the UNOCA complex in Kabul, and by the Herat regional office, which are under a cost-sharing arrangement; (ii) Operational maintenance of the Alpha compound and the Kuwait Joint Support Office; (iii) Cleaning services and waste disposal for six premises in Kabul (UNOCA, compounds A, B and C, the airport terminal and the residence of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General), which are outsourced. Waste disposal services include oil, filters, tires, batteries and junk removal from all UNAMA offices in Kabul; (iv) Pest control and the extermination of mice and rats at all UNAMA premises. Pest control will reduce the risk of infection posed by the many vector-borne diseases endemic in the area, including leishmaniasis and malaria, and will result in the elimination of other insects. The insecticides to be used are deemed safe and will provide long-term solutions to pest problems with minimal impact on the environment. Pest control will be used in both residential and administrative settings; (e) Security services estimated at $12,671,600, including: (i) The Mission's share of the cost of the Afghan Protection Services unit deployed to secure various United Nations compounds in Kabul and throughout the regions. This is a Government-sponsored unit dedicated solely to the protection of United Nations staff and premises. The cost of the salaries of guards and supervisors is borne by the Government of Afghanistan. However, the Mission provides a meal allowance of $6.74 per day per guard and $9.70 per day per supervisor. The provision would also cover the Mission's share of the cost of the expenses of Afghan Protection Services guards country-wide, the Emergency Communication Room and an airport security assistant, payable to the Department of Safety and Security ($2,807,500); (ii) Deployment of International Armed Guards in Kabul and the central, western, southern, eastern, north-eastern and south-eastern regions of Afghanistan. International Armed Guards are deployed in teams composed of nine guards per provincial office. The deployment of these guards to the aforementioned areas, where the security situation is or is becoming volatile is deemed vital, as they are considered more reliable and better skilled than Afghan Protection Services guards for such environments ($7,786,200); (iii) Road missions, including meal allowance for armed escorts and the quick reaction force, and rental of escort vehicles from local vendors. Each road mission requires three vehicles to carry armed escorts, while Mission staff travel in United Nations vehicles. In view of the continued deterioration of the security situation in the central and eastern regions of the country, field offices in those locations require six escort vehicles during road missions. In addition, the quick reaction force provides an armed reaction force in support of UNAMA premises when required to cover the gaps left by the International Military/International Security Assistance Force after the transition ($1,501,000); (iv) Canine services, including dogs and dog handlers, based in Kabul, for deployment to the UNOCA compound, the Alpha compound, compound B and the UNAMA air terminal ($576,900); (f) Alteration and renovation services for various Mission locations at headquarters in Kabul and in all field offices, including minor construction of additional rooms, the realignment of offices and major maintenance projects, such as the re-roofing of older buildings and the maintenance of roads and footpaths ($544,300); (g) Construction services estimated at $6,645,000, including: (i) The third instalment payable for the construction of the Alpha compound. UNAMA is currently occupying the Alpha compound under an agreement by which it would pay $22 million over a period of seven years for the construction of the building. The building was occupied in 2010 and currently provides office and accommodation facilities for 60 international staff. The first two instalments of $3.2 million have been paid and the third is due in 2012 ($3.2 million); (ii) Construction and installation of a containerized sewage treatment plant, which is required in UNOCA to comply with the standing United Nations policy on environmental protection and preservation. As Afghanistan does not have an established sewage disposal system, it is necessary for the Mission to have its own plant ($445,000); (iii) Security upgrading works throughout the Mission, including replacement of existing doors and windows with heavy-duty steel doors/windows, external wall protection with concrete T-walls and Hesco bastions in 20 Mission locations; construction of radio rooms for the Security Operation Centre, wherever it is not possible to reinforce existing radio rooms (10 such Mission locations are considered); 120 modified sea containers with ablution for the Afghan Protection Services and United Nations Protection Unit/border police deployed to protect all UNAMA terminals, to replace existing wooden living accommodation for 823 staff of Afghan Protection Services/United Nations Protection Unit/border police; construction of 80 new accommodation units with brick masonry structures for the Afghan Protection Services/United Nations Protection Unit/border police to replace existing wooden living accommodation where the use of sea containers is not possible owing to space limitations; blast protection for Afghan Protection Services/United Nations Protection Unit/border police living accommodations and firing posts; blast protection and concertina wire around International Armed Guards accommodation units for 30 Mission locations and for fighting posts with Hesco bastions for 150 units at all Mission locations; fence gates at main roads and pedestrian accesses for all UNAMA offices and accommodation units ($2 million); (iv) Fire system to supply and install detectors, fire panels, reel hoses, sprinkler systems, emergency lights, signs, fire hydrants and sprinkler pumps at the following Mission locations: UNOCA compound; compounds B and C; Palace 7; and all field offices ($1 million); (h) Stationery and office supplies ($354,000); (i) Spare parts for the maintenance of accommodation units, office and miscellaneous equipment, and spare parts and toner for photocopiers, including freight costs ($603,900); (j) Maintenance supplies for Mission office locations and accommodation units in Kabul and the field offices ($948,000); (k) Field defence supplies required to maintain the safety and security of UNAMA premises and staff throughout the Mission area ($245,200); (l) Petrol, oil and lubricants for generators ($7,611,600); (m) Sanitation and cleaning materials and supplies for Mission offices and accommodation units in Kabul and the field offices ($303,400); 188. The net variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget reflects mainly: (a) The completion of major security enhancement projects in 2011, including post-blast assessment works and relocation of regional offices, requiring no further investment in 2012; (b) The payment of the balance of the UNAMA share of the security gap project during 2010 and 2011, requiring no further provision in 2012; (c) Fewer quantities of field defence supplies, as most UNAMA premises have been upgraded to meet minimum operating security standards and minimum operating residential security standards. 189. The foregoing would be offset in part by projected additional requirements related to: (a) Petrol, oil and lubricants, owing to the increased price of fuel, that is, $0.88 per litre applied in 2011 as compared to $1.36 per litre applied in 2012; (b) Rental, owing to additional payments required for compound B, which was previously provided to UNAMA free of cost, rental of a plot adjacent to the Alpha compound and the increased share of the Mission's rental of the Herat compound as a result of the increased UNAMA footprint; (c) Acquisition of additional miscellaneous facilities and infrastructure to accommodate two aviation fuel filtration units and the replacement and addition of engineering tools, which are rendered unusable owing to extensive utilization during 2010 and 2011; (d) Acquisition of additional fuel tanks and pumps to ensure proper handling of fuel at all Mission locations. 190. The anticipated net unencumbered balance relates mainly to: (a) Security services, owing to lower than planned requirements for the security gap project, the reduced number of road patrols, resulting in lower costs for road missions and rental of escort vehicles for road missions, and lower than planned deployment of International Armed Guards; (b) The acquisition of less security and safety equipment, owing to the incorporation of items through transfer from other Missions; (c) The acquisition of fewer field defence supplies, owing to sufficient quantities of materials and Hesco bastions in the inventory; (d) The acquisition of fewer miscellaneous facilities and infrastructure, owing to lower than anticipated requirements for engineering workshop tools and equipment; (e) Maintenance services, owing to lower than anticipated requirements for services to maintain the Alpha compound; (f) The acquisition of less office furniture and equipment, owing to the Mission's decision not to continue to expand further into additional regions in view of the continued deterioration of the security situation in the country; (g) Alteration and renovation services, owing to lower than anticipated requirements for routine alteration and renovation works; (h) Maintenance supplies, owing to lower than anticipated requirements for routine and preventive maintenance of the Mission's premises. 191. The foregoing would be offset in part by anticipated additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 related to: (a) Petrol, oil and lubricants, owing to increased prices; (b) Construction services, owing to the need to establish additional physical security for UNAMA premises in order to upgrade them to revised minimum operating security standards and minimum operating residential security standards; (c) Acquisition of additional prefabricated facilities to provide housing to International Armed Guards and Afghan Protection Services staff; (d) Additional spare parts and supplies, owing to the acquisition of a larger quantity of items for generators and air conditioners; (e) The acquisition of additional generators for installation in new and relocated offices; (f) The acquisition of additional accommodation equipment for installation at the UNOCA and Alpha compounds; (g) The acquisition of additional refrigeration equipment for installation in International Armed Guard houses, accommodation units in field offices and new units in the UNOCA and Alpha compounds. Appropriations 2010-2011 Estimated expenditures 2010-2011 Total requirements 2012 Ground transportation 192. The Mission ground transportation fleet is comprised of 490 vehicles, including 60 light vehicles, 14 medium vehicles, 3 heavy vehicles, 384 armoured civilian vehicles, 10 items of material handling equipment, 2 armoured delivery vans, 5 vehicle attachments, 1 item of airfield equipment, 10 armoured ambulances and 1 armoured VIP vehicle. 193. The provision of $2,174,200 reflects requirements for: (a) The acquisition of additional vehicles ($103,500), including one bus for up to 30 passengers to be used at the Kabul Airport; and the replacement of one light vehicle (4x4) to replace an existing vehicle in the Tehran Liaison Office. As to the requirement for the acquisition of a bus, Mission staff were previously allowed to board aircraft at the Kabul Airport from a dedicated UNAMA terminal. These arrangements, however, have been changed by aviation authorities who now require that UNAMA staff use the international terminal to board aircraft for international travel. Regarding the proposed replacement of one light vehicle for the Tehran Liaison Office, redeployment from the existing fleet was considered but found to be impractical, as the fleet consists of diesel-powered vehicles and the Tehran Office requires a gasoline-powered vehicle. In addition, the cost of shipping a vehicle from Afghanistan to Tehran would not be cost-effective owing to security and insurance costs; (b) The acquisition of additional workshop equipment and tools for the Mission's auto repair shops to replace tools that have been damaged and/or broken as a result of normal wear and tear, including vehicle lift, air conditioning recharging machines and air compressors. The upgrade of the Mission's auto repair shops has become critical, considering that the existing equipment is not fit to lift heavy armoured vehicles. This has become a safety issue both for staff working in the workshops and for the expensive armoured vehicles in the fleet, which could be damaged and could break down existing equipment more suitable for soft skin vehicles. The upgrade of workshops will comply with international safety standards and result in better maintenance of armoured vehicles in a safe manner ($201,700); (c) The rental of specialized vehicles and heavy equipment for engineering use, including front-end loaders, heavy-duty cranes and excavators, to be used in construction projects and regular maintenance work; and the rental of a station-wagon vehicle for the Liaison Office in Dubai ($74,900); (d) Insurance to cover third-party liability for a fleet of 486 vehicles ($22,100); (e) Spare parts and repairs and maintenance, including painting, body work, accident repair and specialized components repair, as well as routine replacement of worn-out or damaged parts ($1 million); (f) Petrol, oil and lubricants based on an estimated consumption of 757,000 litres per year for all UNAMA vehicles at a cost of $1.36 per litre, offset in part by off-the-road vehicles adjustments and recoveries from national staff for pick-up and drop-off services ($772,000). 194. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects: (a) The completion of the acquisition of the final batch of armoured vehicles during 2011, requiring no acquisition of additional vehicles in 2012, other than one bus for up to 30 passengers to be used at the Kabul Airport and the replacement of one light vehicle (4x4) for the Tehran Liaison Office; (b) A lower number of engineering projects planned for 2012, requiring a decreased provision for rental of construction and engineering equipment; (c) A lower consumption of petrol, oil and lubricants resulting from a reduction of road missions in view of the continued deterioration of the security situation in the country. 195. The foregoing would be offset in part by increased requirements for the acquisition of additional vehicle workshop equipment to upgrade the transport workshop in order to enable it to handle the inspection and maintenance of heavy armoured vehicles. 196. The anticipated net unencumbered balance relates mainly to the acquisition of fewer than budgeted armoured vehicles for field offices, as the Mission has not expanded and thus required no additional deployment of vehicles; and a lower than anticipated consumption of petrol, oil and lubricants, resulting from the continued restriction placed on ground movements caused by the continued deterioration of the security situation in the country. 197. The foregoing would be offset in part by anticipated additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 related to rental of vehicles owing to the additional use of heavy-duty engineering equipment to undertake new construction and security enhancement projects, and spare parts, repairs and maintenance for armoured vehicles. Variance 2011-2012 Air transportation 198. The Mission air fleet is comprised of 10 aircraft, including 5 fixed-wing and 5 rotary-wing aircraft, operating a total of 7,567 hours (3,506 hours for the fixed-wing and 4,061 hours for the rotary-wing aircraft). 199. The provision of $54,968,200 reflects requirements for: (a) Rental and operation of fixed-wing aircraft ($19,980,900); (b) Rental and operation of rotary-wing aircraft ($25,393,100); (c) Petrol, oil and lubricants for an estimated 5.6 million litres of aviation fuel, based on 7,567 flight hours, at a rate of $1.8 per litre, offset in part by anticipated recoveries from United Nations agencies for the use of UNAMA aircraft ($8,577,800); (d) Liability insurance ($97,200); (e) Landing fees and handling charges ($325,900); (f) Air safety equipment and supplies related to air safety and the maintenance of airfields and helipads, and for personal safety and maintenance of the UNAMA terminal ($13,600); (g) Aircrew subsistence allowance ($289,400); (h) Air transport services ($290,300), including: (i) The cost of air navigation charges for UNAMA flights from Kabul to Dubai and vice-versa, and airport charges in neighbouring countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and other European and Asian countries ($149,900); (ii) The cost of monthly aviation fuel tests/analysis for two tests per month at the rate of $1,500 per test ($36,000); (iii) Charges for air tracking services ($24,400); (iv) Charges for air tickets issued by the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service to transport UNAMA personnel within the Mission area and to Islamabad ($80,000). 200. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects the discontinuation of one rotary-wing aircraft from the Mission's air fleet as result of scheduling efficiencies of the remaining air assets, offset in part by increased costs for rental and operation of fixed-wing aircraft, and higher prices of fuel, that is, $1.70 per litre for 2012 as compared to $1.30 per litre for 2011. 201. The anticipated net additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 relate to the rental and operation of fixed-wing aircraft, resulting from an unforeseen change in contractual prices, and landing fees and ground handling charges in view of the increased frequency of flights and the increased rates applicable to the DHC-7 aircraft flights. 202. The foregoing would be offset in part by an anticipated unencumbered balance related to: (a) The rental and operation of rotary-wing aircraft, owing to a delayed deployment of helicopters; (b) Petrol, oil and lubricants, owing to a high level of recoveries related to charter costs of UNAMA air assets from other agencies; (c) Air crew subsistence allowance, owing to the lower than anticipated overnight stay outside the Mission area by aircrew members; (d) Services, owing to the lower than anticipated utilization of United Nations Humanitarian Air Service flights, as most staff travel has been undertaken on the Mission's own air assets. Communications 203. The provision of $7,680,600 reflects requirements for communications, including: (a) The acquisition of additional communications equipment, including additional VHF trunking hand-held radios for the completion of the Tetra project, consisting of the migration of VHF/UHF radio communication to digital radio systems, digital microwave links, transceiver VHF base air band and high-frequency radios, among others ($3,030,800); (b) Commercial communications, including transponder charges for the Mission at large; Brindisi leased lines/shared Internet access; local, Kuwait Joint Support Office and Islamabad/Tehran Liaison Offices Internet services; dedicated E1 connectivity to provincial offices; VSAT (very small aperture terminal) telephone charges for official calls; satellite phone call charges; BGAN/Inmarsat charges; local GSM phone charges; charges for official calls made to extensions at Headquarters; communications licences; post office box charges; global positioning system vehicle tracking charges; transponder charges for the VSAT link to Kuwait and for linking provincial offices to Kabul ($3,776,700); (c) Communications support services to cover centralized voice communication support at a rate of $25 per year per extension for 2,312 telephone extensions, which provide access by the Mission to the global PABX (private automated branch exchange) and Department of Peacekeeping Operations global support services ($57,800); (d) Spare parts and supplies ($280,000); (e) The acquisition of public information equipment, such as radio equipment, video cameras, external hard drives and photographic equipment (lens and body) ($17,300); (f) Public information services, including printed material, radio and television production and broadcasting, community outreach materials, photographic exhibits, electronic subscriptions to daily media monitoring service and graphic artist and translation services outsourcing, among others ($500,000); (g) Supplies and maintenance related to public information ($18,000). 204. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects the completion of the Mission's communications upgrade project in 2011, requiring no major capital investment in 2012; the utilization of current actual transponder charges, which are significantly lower than charges in 2011, and the exclusion of transponder link charges between Kuwait and the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy; and the inclusion of anticipated adjustments for recovery of personal calls from staff members and telephone lines used by other agencies. 205. The anticipated net unencumbered balance relates mainly to lower than anticipated transponder charges and United Nations Logistics Base leased line charges, the cancellation of BlackBerry services, dedicated E1 lines and the unused global positioning vehicle tracking system, as equipment and service have yet to materialize, and cancellation of transponder charges for the VSAT Kuwait-United Nations Logistics Base link; and public information services owing to a delay in implementation of planned activities. 206. The foregoing would be offset in part by anticipated additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 related to the acquisition of communications equipment owing to the additional procurement of Tetra equipment in order to upgrade the Mission's communications infrastructure to migrate from analogue to digital systems. Information technology 207. The provision of $3,322,100 reflects requirements for information technology, including: (a) The acquisition of additional information technology equipment, including additional and replacement laptop computers, monitors, printers, servers, network routers and switches, scanners and geographic information system equipment ($1,315,600); (b) The acquisition of various software packages, including Mission-specific information technology software, geographic information system satellite data and imagery for the production of maps, and geographic information system software maintenance ($405,300); (c) Information technology services required for the provision of centralized information technology services to Mission headquarters in Kabul and to all field offices, as well as centralized data storage services at the United Nations Logistics Base ($673,400); (d) Licences, fees and rental of software, centrally managed based on the number of desktop and laptop computers at the Mission ($627,800); (e) Spare parts and supplies ($300,000). 208. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects the completion of the Mission's major information technology upgrading project in 2010-2011 as a result of which significant capital investment is not required in 2012, offset in part by increased requirements for licences, fees and rental of software owing mainly to the need to support more information technology equipment and increased charges per computer. 209. The anticipated additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 relate to the acquisition of a spot satellite imagery system for the geographic information system and other software packages, and to the acquisition of additional toner for malfunctioning printers. Medical 210. The provision of $721,900 reflects requirements for the cost of medical services, including medical/casualty evacuations of Mission staff; medical evacuation using air ambulance from a locally contracted provider; airfare for out of country medical referrals when medical specialists are not available; and maintenance of medical equipment ($261,500); and medical supplies, including medicines and laboratory supplies ($460,400). 211. UNAMA provides medicines and consumables to its medical facilities/satellite clinics established in Mission premises, including the main medical clinic in Kabul and eight satellite clinics in the regions. Recoveries are anticipated from staff of various United Nations agencies, who visit the clinics and receive medical services on a cost recovery basis. 212. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects the completion in 2011 of the acquisition of additional life-saving medical equipment for all Mission locations, in compliance with security enhancements for the Mission in Afghanistan, requiring no further investment in 2012, offset in part by increased resources for medical services owing to the inclusion of one additional medical evacuation by air ambulance service. 213. The anticipated net unencumbered balance relates mainly to the high level of recoveries from staff of various United Nations agencies who visit the clinics and receive medical services on a cost recovery basis, offset in part by anticipated additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 related to the acquisition of supplementary medical equipment to comply with revised security requirements for the offices in Kabul and the regional clinics. Other supplies, services and equipment 214. The provision of $3,293,500 reflects requirements for other supplies, services and equipment, including: (a) The acquisition of equipment, including various types of office and residential equipment, such as air conditioners, air purifiers, fans, vacuum cleaners, drinking-water dispensers, vehicle first-aid kits, a luggage trolley, a weighing scale, archive boxes and a variety of other items required for new office and accommodation units or to replace existing equipment in Kabul and in the field offices ($463,100); (b) Welfare items for field offices, including gym equipment and other sports items; recreation and entertainment equipment and supplies, such as television sets, ping-pong tables and projectors; library items, such as books, magazines and DVDs; and other welfare items ($199,000); (c) Subscriptions, including the renewal of existing subscriptions to newspapers and magazines and the television satellite network, and television cable network cards and service for the UNOCA and Alpha compounds in Kabul, and for 7 regional and 15 provincial offices ($387,300); (d) Printing and reproduction of materials to be used at the UNAMA airport terminal, such as boarding cards for passengers of United Nations aircraft; and by the Movement Control Section, such as dangerous goods stickers and International Air Transport Association dangerous goods manuals required for use by staff handling dangerous goods; by the Surface Transport Section, for printing requirements related to the safe driving campaign and various forms used to record sundry activities of a routine nature, such as trip tickets, work orders, fuel coupons, car wash coupons and others; as well as by the Human Rights Unit, to continue its campaign during 2012 by using broadcast and print media, including posters, various printed reports and booklets promoting key messages of concern, and to develop posters and booklets to communicate short, clear human rights messages, and booklets on selected human rights issues that are sensitive to the level of literacy, which will be produced by Human Rights Unit staff and disseminated in conjunction with other outreach and advocacy initiatives ($50,000); (e) Uniforms, flags and decals for security, military and police personnel, including uniforms for local security guards and drivers; and safety and protective clothing items and footwear for staff in engineering, transport and supplies, and movement control areas ($278,200); (f) Training fees, supplies and services ($192,200); (g) Official functions at the rate of $1,000 per field office (23 offices), required to promote and implement an outreach strategy to facilitate, encourage and substantiate dialogue and cooperation between communities, villages, districts, provinces, interest groups, tribal structures, religious leaders, Government officials, elected representatives and political parties at the regional and provincial levels ($23,000); (h) Hospitality, for the use of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General in supporting their official interactions and those of their senior teams with other international stakeholders ($19,000); (i) General insurance to provide coverage for cash in transit and for the shipment of equipment and supplies to the Mission area ($52,200); (j) Bank charges paid to financial institutions in the various locations where the Mission maintains bank accounts, inclusive of charges for the delivery of funds to field offices, including the Kuwait Joint Support Office ($171,000); (k) Miscellaneous claims and adjustments to cover third-party claims for incidents caused by Mission staff in the course of the performance of their official duties and claims for the loss of personal effects ($33,200); (l) Freight costs, including mail and pouch services, including freight forwarding and related costs to cover the shipment of materials and supplies to field offices, to the Logistics Support Office in Dubai and to the Kuwait Joint Support Office; the shipment of equipment to and from the United Nations Logistics Base, as well as freight forwarding and related services; the cost of demurrage and storage while processing customs clearance documents; and the cost of mail and pouch services. The Mission utilizes the services of commercial freight companies for transporting materials and supplies to field offices ($1,233,500); (m) Rations, including the maintenance of the emergency stock of rations (meals ready to eat) in line with the minimum operating security standards for Afghanistan, and the supply of filtered water in the offices for the consumption of staff in view of the poor quality of tap water in the country ($191,800). 215. The variance between the 2012 requirements and the 2011 approved budget mainly reflects increased requirements for: (a) Other freight and related costs, resulting from an increased volume of official documents and material, and shipments to various Mission locations, including the Kuwait Joint Support Office; (b) Increased charges for demurrage and storage, owing to delays in processing custom clearance documents in Afghanistan; (c) Increased cost of shipping of equipment and supplies within Afghanistan, including armoured vehicles. 216. The foregoing would be offset in part by the completion in 2011 of the acquisition of satellite television network equipment for United Nations-provided accommodation in the UNOCA and Alpha compounds in Kabul and in field offices, including the acquisition of related equipment and supplies, and the acquisition of other equipment and supplies for the construction and maintenance of additional United Nations-provided accommodation in Kabul and in field offices. 217. The anticipated net additional requirements in the biennium 2010-2011 relate to: (a) The acquisition of supplementary equipment, including air conditioners for the additional staff accommodation units that have been constructed to provide accommodation for staff in comparatively safer and more secure locations in order to mitigate the threats arising from the continued deterioration of the security situation in the country; (b) Additional freight and related costs, including payments for demurrage resulting from delays in the clearance of goods for the Mission from customs, and the additional charges for the shipment of equipment and armoured vehicles within the Mission area; (c) Uniforms, flags and decals, owing to the higher than anticipated cost of materials procured through Headquarters-system contracts, such as jackets, shirts, trousers, boots and overcoats, which were required for security and other personnel. 218. The foregoing would be offset in part by an anticipated unencumbered balance related to: (a) Subscriptions, owing to the lower than anticipated cost of installation of cable television network services for field offices; (b) Training fees, supplies and services, owing to the lower than anticipated implementation of training activities. Appropriations 2010 Variance savings/ (deficit) Total requirements 2011 Net requirements 2011 Variance 2010-2011 Quick-impact projects 219. No provision is anticipated for 2012 as a result of the temporary discontinuation of quick-impact projects to assess the impact of various projects undertaken by the Mission during 2011. A nominal provision is proposed for outreach activities under public information services. 220. The anticipated unencumbered balance relates mainly to the reprioritization of activities, under which part of the 2010 funding approved for this class was realigned to undertake security enhancements in the Mission's locations throughout Afghanistan, and to the Mission's limited capacity to implement quick-impact projects in the field given the continued deterioration of the security situation in the country. V. Summary of follow-up action taken to implement relevant recommendations of internal and external oversight bodies, and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions Brief description of the recommendation Action taken to implement the recommendation Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions Implementation of General Assembly resolution 63/261 on the strengthening of the Department of Political Affairs and estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council (A/65/602) The Advisory Committee welcomes the further improvements made to the presentation for special political missions, in particular the inclusion, in accordance with the earlier request of the Committee, of programme performance information for 2010 for the two largest missions, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), which account for 71 per cent of the requirements (A/64/7/Add.13, paras. 7 and 9). However, further efforts should be made to formulate the indicators of achievement in a manner that facilitates measurement of performance and allows for a better assessment of progress in the achievement of expected accomplishments. The Advisory Committee is also of the opinion that efforts should be made to provide more consistency in the quality of the presentation for all special political missions. The Committee further recalls that, in the context of performance reporting, reduced requirements under specific objects of expenditure do not necessarily constitute savings; they may also be the result of underexpenditure or an indication of overbudgeting (para. 14). UNAMA has revised the indicators of achievement and performance measures to reflect the alignment of the Mission's efforts to facilitate outcomes related to key developments in the second half of 2010 and 2011, including the development of the Kabul Process and Consultative Peace Jirga. The Advisory Committee has also noted the inclusion of information on cooperation and coordination with other United Nations entities in the budget proposals for special political missions. The Committee is of the view that further efforts should be made to take account of possibilities for cooperation among various United Nations presences in a specific geographical location, for example in the area of ground transportation, and to explore cost-sharing possibilities whenever possible, with a view to achieving cost savings or other efficiencies related to either services or equipment (para. 15). UNAMA remains committed to reducing operational costs and maintenance by entering into common services agreement with other United Nations agencies. The multiagency compounds in Herat, Islamabad, Tehran, UNOCA in Kabul and the UNAMA Kuwait Joint Support Office co-located with UNAMI in Kuwait are evidence of such efforts. In addition, in terms of Common Security Management/Integrated Security Services, a security management team (UNAMA, the United Nations Department of Safety and Security and the specialized funds, programmes and agencies) coordinates security arrangements on a cost-sharing basis. Common services agreements on a security arrangement are in place between UNAMA and other agencies in Mission compounds in Herat, Ghor, Farah, Badghis, Maymana, Kunduz, Fayz Abad, Day Kundi, Gardez, Khost, Tirin Kot and Qalat, as well as in UNOCA (Kabul). UNAMA will continue to explore such cost-cutting opportunities in 2012. The Advisory Committee considers that the budget presentation for special political missions should include information on all resources available from different sources of funding. For example, the requirements for the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide did not provide information on support received from extrabudgetary resources in the form of posts. Relevant information was provided to the Committee, upon enquiry. The Advisory Committee is of the opinion that the level of extrabudgetary resources provided to special political missions should be fully disclosed so as to allow for a clear and transparent analysis of the resources proposed as compared with capacity available from all types of funding and the needs identified. Furthermore, the presentation for special political missions should consistently include information on actual and budgeted vacancy rates; resource requirement changes; a clear description of the functions of new positions proposed; and organizational charts, including current and proposed posts and grade levels; and should identify if a position proposed is a resubmission of a previous request (para. 16). The Mission usually provides information on extra resources available, as provided in the overview section of the present document, that is, discussions are currently under way to look at future support to the Special Adviser through UNOPS; at this stage, the Mission hopes to maintain a funding level similar to that available in 2011, that is, approximately $200,000, referred to in paragraph 34 of the present document. The Advisory Committee has commented on the successive restructuring exercises undertaken by the Mission since 2009 (see A/64/7/Add.13, para. 135). The Committee recognizes the need to respond to the refocused priorities, ensuring critical programme capacity while also guaranteeing the safety and security of assets and staff, given the prevalent security conditions in the mission area. The Committee also welcomes the streamlining of the reporting lines and the elimination of duplication of functions, which should enhance communication and teamwork. Therefore, it does not object to the structural reorganization proposed for 2011. The Committee is concerned about continual restructuring exercises, which create unnecessary distraction and detract from the required focus on mandate delivery. The Committee is of the view that, at some point, a balance has to be found whereby consolidation is allowed while leaving some room to respond to changes in operational conditions or possible mandate revisions. An analysis of how the reorganization of the Mission has contributed to the implementation of the mandate should be included in the budget submission for 2012 (para. 151). An overall analysis of the restructuring undertaken in 2011, indicating the benefits achieved in terms of reporting lines and overall organizational coherence in aligning the Mission's priority areas of engagement, as well as cost savings and synergies under the broader integration of effort with other parts of the United Nations system, is outlined in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the present document. The Advisory Committee was also informed of the support UNAMI was currently providing to the office of UNAMA in Kuwait, including basic services and supplies, as well as 14 UNAMI vehicles to be used by UNAMA free of charge. The Committee has always encouraged increased cooperation between and among missions operating in the same geographic location in order to achieve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The Committee is nevertheless of the view that in the interest of budgetary transparency and adherence to accounting principles, the resource provision for inter-mission cooperation and efficiency gains realized should be clearly reflected in the budgets of the missions concerned (para. 210). The resource provision for inter-mission cooperation and efficiency gains to be realized owing to the merging of back office activities with UNAMI through the Kuwait Joint Support Office will be reflected in a separate budget submission.

United Nations elections support UNDP The UNDP electoral assistance project, Elect, received a no-cost extension until the end of June 2011. A new multilateral basket fund is currently being designed to focus on building infrastructure and technical expertise in local electoral institutions, ensuring more sustainable elections in the future. There are several activities where UNAMA facilitates and supports the electoral process. It provides local expertise and political analysis at the local level and at the same time acts as a facilitator among the key actors. UNAMA provides the ground for political leverage, identifies gaps and provides advice at all levels. While the UNDP Elect programme provides technical support through staff co-located with the Independent Election Committee to support procurement, the most important existing mechanisms are: - The Project Board, co-chaired by the Independent Election Committee or the Electoral Complaints Commission (depending on the issue under review) and UNDP. Members include UNAMA, UNDP, donors and key domestic stakeholders, as required. - The Technical Group Meeting, co-chaired by the Independent Election Committee/Electoral Complaints Commission and UNDP. Members include the Independent Election Committee, UNDP, implementing partners, donors to UNDP Elect and other participants, as agreed. - The elections videoconference with Headquarters, with the participation of UNAMA, UNDP-Elect, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, UNDP and the Department of Political Affairs. Salaam Support Group UNOPS Currently, $300,000 has been provided by the Government of Denmark to UNOPS. Funds are released on the basis of a memorandum of understanding between UNAMA and UNOPS to provide technical support. UNOPS provides quarterly progress reports to the Government of Denmark. UNAMA provides assistance to the peace and reconciliation process being undertaken by the Government of Afghanistan. The goal is to provide technical expertise in specific areas and logistical support, in particular for the outreach efforts of the High Peace Council. Several members of the international community have asked how they could support UNAMA efforts in this area. Given that one of the areas identified was to provide specific technical expertise to support the Government's programme initiatives, it was decided to establish, in conjunction with UNOPS, a mechanism to allow the recruitment on a short-term basis of consultants who could deliver support to UNAMA to assist the Government in a timely and effective manner. As a result, a memorandum of understanding was signed between UNAMA and UNOPS concerning the provision of technical services and, subsequently, the first donor contribution was received. The expected outcome of the project is the increased capacity of the Government to lead and undertake initiatives through the High Peace Council and related mechanisms to support the peace and reconciliation process. Closing the security gap UNDP, United Nations Department of Safety and Security The following funding has been provided to support the project: Government of Ireland: Euro200,000; UNAMA: $5 million; Government of Japan: $17 million The "closing the security gap" project aims to recruit, train and equip 2,200 Afghan police to provide protection to the United Nations system in Afghanistan, including safeguarding facilities, escorts and the quick response force in emergencies. The Deputy Special Representative (Pillar II) chairs the project board on behalf of the Special Representative. The project board provides strategic direction to guide the implementation given the challenges faced by the United Nations owing to the deterioration of the security environment. The project is managed by UNDP on behalf of the entire United Nations system and technical advice is provided by the United Nations Department of Safety and Security. The project itself commenced in November 2010 and is expected to last for two years.
