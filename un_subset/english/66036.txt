For the 2013/14 period, the overall proposed resources for UNISFA amount to $305,351,200, representing an increase of $47.4 million, or 18.4 per cent, from the 2012/13 apportionment of $257,932,000. Cost estimates for military and police personnel are higher than the 2012/13 apportionment by $3.4 million, owing primarily to the lower delayed deployment factor of 2 per cent used for military observers, compared with 25 per cent in 2012/13, and the additional requirements for rations for military contingents. Cost estimates for civilian personnel exceed the 2012/13 apportionment by $8.9 million. The additional requirements are attributable primarily to the additional 28 staff proposed for the 2013/14 period, mainly to support the mission's expanded and accelerated construction plan and the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism. The higher requirements of $35.2 million under operational costs are primarily attributable to the expansion and acceleration of the mission's construction plan, increased requirements for air transportation and higher requirements for petrol, oil and lubricants to accommodate additional generators. The budget provides for the deployment of 225 military observers, 3,975 military contingent personnel, 50 United Nations police officers, 146 international staff, 97 national staff and 33 United Nations Volunteers, including 16 temporary positions. The total resource requirements for UNISFA for the financial period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 have been linked to the mission's objective through a number of results-based frameworks, organized according to component (security, governance and border monitoring; and support). The human resources of the mission in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the mission as a whole. The explanations of variances in resource levels, both human resources and financial resources, have been linked, where applicable, to specific outputs planned by the mission.

The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in section IV of the present report. I. Mandate and planned results A. Overall 1. The mandate of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1990 (2011) and expanded by the Council in its resolution 2024 (2011). The most recent extension of the mandate was authorized by the Council in its resolution 2075 (2012), by which the Council extended the mandate until 31 May 2013. 2. The mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, support for the implementation of the agreement of 20 June 2011 between the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, allowing for returns, and ensuring the protection of civilians and support for the peaceful administration of the Abyei Area, as well as support for the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism in creating a safe and demilitarized border zone. 3. Within this overall objective, UNISFA will, during the budget period, contribute to a number of expected accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below. These frameworks are organized according to components (security, governance and border monitoring; and support) derived from the mandate of the mission. 4. The expected accomplishments would lead to the fulfilment of the Security Council's objective within the lifetime of the mission and the indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishments during the budget period. The human resources of UNISFA, in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the mission executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the mission as a whole. Variances in the number of personnel, compared with the 2012/13 budget, have been explained under the respective components. 5. By its resolution 1990 (2011), the Security Council authorized UNISFA a maximum strength of 4,200 military personnel, 50 police personnel and an appropriate civilian component. Uniformed personnel levels were further maintained by subsequent resolutions of the Council, most recently resolution 2075 (2012). B. Planning assumptions and mission support initiatives 6. UNISFA is led by the Head of Mission, who also serves as Force Commander, at the Assistant Secretary-General level. The mission comprises a mission headquarters in Abyei town and 10 company operating bases, six temporary operating bases in the Abyei Area and a logistics base in Kadugli. 7. Nine agreements were signed between the Sudan and South Sudan in Addis Ababa on 27 September 2012 establishing the framework for future cooperation and the resolution of outstanding post-secession issues. These agreements demonstrate progress of both parties to fulfil their respective obligations under Security Council resolution 2046 (2012) and the African Union Peace and Security Council Road Map of 24 April 2012. While no agreement regarding the final status of the Abyei Area has been reached, it is expected that the current dialogue between the Sudan and South Sudan will result in an agreement on a process that will settle the status of the Abyei Area. It is anticipated that all aspects of both the 20 June 2011 and the 27 September 2012 agreements will be implemented during the 2013/14 period, including the establishment of stipulated institutions and the creation of the Abyei Police Service. However, if an agreement is not reached, UNISFA will continue to provide security, law and order and support the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism. 8. The security situation in the Abyei Area is expected to remain stable but unpredictable with risks of non-military security threats, including criminal activities, the presence of armed elements within the various communities, and possible incursions of illegal groups or proxy forces. Any scale of intercommunity clashes could escalate into full-blown conflict. Therefore, every effort will be made to prevent such clashes. 9. During the 2013/14 period, an increase in returns of displaced persons belonging to the Ngok Dinka community is expected. To facilitate the return of the displaced population and the migration of nomads and their cattle, temporary operating bases in Marial Achak, Farouk, Um Khaer, Leu, Saheib, Cwein, and permanent and non-permanent checkpoints were established. UNISFA will continue to initiate conflict mitigation, peace and co-existence measures and mechanisms among the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya, to facilitate an organized and orderly migration and the return of the displaced to Abyei. 10. The police component will be deployed when the parties establish the Abyei Area Administration and with it the Abyei Police Service. It will be composed of personnel from multiple police-contributing countries, organized in three units. One unit will assist with the vetting, selection and recruitment of the Abyei Police Service, the second will focus on training and development and the third (and largest) will provide operational support. The operational component will be based in Abyei, Diffra and Agok and other locations occupied by the Abyei Police Service. 11. The police component will assist the parties in the design of the Service and the preparation of start-up documents, including terms of reference for the police personnel, a strategic plan, implementation framework and concept of operations, in coordination with the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee; develop criteria for vetting, selection and recruitment; provide training and mentoring; and identify and mobilize donor support. Aimed at increasing the local community's confidence with regard to the security situation, the mission will also assist in the development of operational plans and procedures to address migration, nomad-related issues, livestock theft, oil infrastructure protection and gender issues, and will provide guidance and assistance in implementing a community policing strategy to improve public and police relations. The component will also coordinate with the Abyei Police Service to support complementary improvements in the corrections system, to ensure that increases in the police presence do not lead to an overstretching of the capacity of local prisons. 12. The mission is planning for the deployment of a small advance police team, comprising 1 senior police adviser and 11 police advisers. The purpose of the advance team is to provide UNISFA with assistance in planning for the full deployment of the Abyei Police Service and to advise the UNISFA Head of Mission on law and order issues. 13. To support the provision of security, the delivery of humanitarian aid, freedom of movement and the protection of civilians under imminent threat, the Mine Action Service, together with United Nations Office for Project Services and in collaboration with UNISFA, will undertake emergency humanitarian mine action operations, including overall planning, coordination and provision of quality assurance. Mine action operations will focus on hazardous area surveys, landmine/explosive remnants of war clearance and destruction, risk education for United Nations staff, data management and coordination and quality assurance. Reducing the risk of death and injury from landmines and explosive remnants of war will have the additional benefit of encouraging voluntary returns. 14. The Governments of the Sudan and South Sudan are expected to operationalize the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism during the 2013/14 period. Once operationalized, the Joint Mechanism, with UNISFA support, is expected to monitor, verify and investigate allegations of cross-border movements or incidents. In accordance with the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism operations roll-out plan, which has been accepted by the Governments of the Sudan and South Sudan within the framework of the Joint Political and Security Mechanism, four sector headquarters and 10 team sites will be established along the 2,200 km border. In order to prepare for the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism, the Sudan, South Sudan and UNISFA have deployed monitors to a temporary headquarters in Assosa, Ethiopia. 15. The mission will focus on maintaining seamless supply and resupply lines of fuel, rations and other logistical support to all locations, including the remote Border Monitoring Team site locations. 16. The mission will be deployed to mission headquarters in Abyei town and 10 operational locations, including 3 locations taken over from the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) and 7 to be constructed or currently under construction. The construction timeline has faced delays owing to the rainy season, the slow deployment of engineering staff and the expansion of the mission's construction plan. 17. During the 2013/14 period, the mission will aim to complete the construction projects that were not completed in 2012/13. Aimed at improving the living and working conditions in the mission, UNISFA intends to build hard-walled office and living accommodation for the military observers, staff officers and civilian staff in Abyei headquarters by adopting the construction concept successfully implemented by the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). 18. In the 2013/14 period, the mission will complete the following four large construction projects valued at over $1 million each: (a) an $8 million staff living accommodations site able to accommodate over 400 personnel in Abyei town, which will include common service areas and visitor transit rooms; (b) a $5 million twostorey building to serve as force headquarters, which will include a level 1 clinic for civilian staff, conference rooms and meeting areas, along with a cafeteria; (c) a $5.1 million maintenance project for the roadways in and around seven camps, which will facilitate the delivery of supplies to the camps and provide a costeffective alternative to using air assets for the delivery of goods and supplies; (d) a $1.2 million project to maintain 12 helipads and airstrips in the Abyei Area, which will facilitate the transfer of passengers and cargo in and out of the Abyei Area. 19. In order to improve the provision of basic medical services, the mission will acquire a level 1 hospital to support the operations of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism. 20. The mission will provide support to the forward deployment locations of the Joint Mechanism. It is planned that 90 United Nations military observers and national monitors from the Sudan and South Sudan will be deployed to the headquarters of the Joint Mechanism, its sector headquarters and its team sites. The mission will also need to construct and maintain facilities in these forward locations. 21. UNISFA will ensure smooth transition towards the implementation planned for the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and Umoja in 2013/14. 22. To implement the plan described above, the mission will need 28 new posts and positions (3 international, 16 general temporary assistance, 8 national and 1 United Nations Volunteer) in 2013/14. To further support the border verification mandate, since the approval of the 2012/13 budget, the strength of military observers has been increased by 90, which has been offset by a reduction of 90 in the strength of military contingent personnel. C. Regional mission cooperation 23. UNISFA will maintain regular and close interaction with the Special Envoy for the Sudan and South Sudan in order to synchronize actions that can secure the continued compliance by the parties with their obligations under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, decisions of the African Union and the various agreements that they have signed. It will be important that the mission continue its strong cooperation with the other United Nations operations in the Sudan and South Sudan, including the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and UNMISS. 24. While the mission's mandate and activities will be distinct from the other missions in the Sudan and South Sudan, UNISFA will continue to cooperate with, and share to the fullest extent practicable, existing logistical arrangements and support structures in order to maintain the smallest presence possible on the ground. In addition to the sharing of aircraft, in its liaison offices based in Khartoum and Juba, UNISFA will be provided legal assistance by UNAMID and UNMISS respectively, to meet legal needs in the liaison offices. 25. By its resolution 64/269, the General Assembly approved the establishment of the Regional Service Centre at the logistics hub in Entebbe, Uganda, for the purpose of consolidating administrative and support functions from geographically grouped field missions into a stand-alone regional centre, as proposed in the SecretaryGeneral's report on the global field support strategy (A/64/633). Four initial projects were identified for transfer of functions and related resources to the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe in 2011/12 (check-in and check-out processing of field personnel, processing of education grants, the operation of a regional training and conference centre and the operation of the Transportation and Movement Integrated Control Centre), with additional finance functions (aspects of field-based payroll, payments, cashier and accounts) and human resources functions (international recruitment, post management and time and attendance) and related resources identified for transfer in 2012/13. The finance and human resources functions are proposed to be strengthened at the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe during 2013/14 in order to align the shared service operation of the Centre to the Umoja model and to the implementation of Inspira, as part of an increased delegation of authority to missions. 26. In accordance with resolution 64/269, the results-based-budgeting frameworks for the Regional Service Centre, as well as the UNISFA share for the post and nonpost resource requirements of the Centre for 2013/14 are reflected in the present budget proposal. No posts are proposed to be redeployed from UNISFA to the Centre. The UNISFA share of the costs for the Centre ($687,700) are set out in section II.H below. D. Partnerships and country team coordination 27. Given the relatively small size of the UNISFA civilian component, there will be a continuing need for strong civil-military coordination to support the delivery of humanitarian aid, ensure the safety and freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel and capitalize on synergies between the role of military and police components in providing for the physical protection of civilians and the programmatic roles of United Nations funds, programmes and agencies operational in the Abyei Area. UNISFA will coordinate its activities with United Nations funds, programmes and agencies present in Abyei, as well as national and international non-governmental organizations and bilateral donors, through a civilian-military coordination structure. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations Resident Coordinators Support Office will remain the primary interface for UNISFA on these issues. 28. In its resolution 1990 (2011), the Security Council requested the SecretaryGeneral to ensure that effective human rights monitoring was carried out and that the results be included in his reports to the Security Council. This function will continue to be performed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). E. Results-based-budgeting frameworks 29. In order to facilitate the presentation of proposed changes in human resources, six categories of possible action with respect to staffing have been identified. A definition of the terminology with respect to the six categories is contained in annex I.A to the present report. 30. Overall mission direction and management are to be provided by the immediate Office of the Head of Mission/Force Commander. International staff National staff a United Nations Volunteers USG- ASG D-2- D-1 P-5- P-4 P-3- P-2 Field Service Subtotal Office of the Force Commander Approved posts 2012/13 Proposed posts 2013/14 Office of the Deputy Force Commander Office of the Force Chief of Staff Conduct and Discipline Team a Includes National Professional Officers and national General Service staff. International staff: establishment of one P-4 post 31. Currently the mission has no conduct and discipline officer or focal point. The Conduct and Discipline Team will be staffed by one senior-level expert on personnel conduct issues and will be the mission focal point on sexual exploitation and abuse. The one dedicated Conduct and Discipline Officer, at the P-4 level, will be located in Abyei with the mission headquarters and will advise the Head of Mission on all matters relating to conduct and discipline. The Officer will be guided and supported by both the regional conduct and discipline focal point and the Conduct and Discipline Unit at United Nations Headquarters. The post will address all issues such as preventing misconduct, handling complaints and data management and ensuring compliance with United Nations standards of conduct. The creation of this post is part of the ongoing reforms flowing from reports of sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations, which the United Nations has been pursuing vigorously since early 2004. Component 1: security, governance and border monitoring 32. UNISFA will provide the sole security presence in Abyei, following the withdrawal of the Sudanese military forces and the South Sudanese military and police force. In order to monitor demilitarization, deter threats, maintain situational awareness, build confidence and help create conditions conducive to the safety and security of humanitarian operations, UNISFA will conduct mobile and dynamic operations, carry out day and night patrols and provide escorts, upon request. When requested, the mission will provide security for oil infrastructure, in cooperation with the Abyei Police Service. During the dry season, the mission will devote additional resources to key areas to ensure secure seasonal migration. To support the implementation of the security aspects of the 20 June 2011 Agreement, the mission will facilitate the work of the Joint Military Observers Committee and the Joint Military Observer teams, with the Head of Mission chairing the Committee. 33. The police component will strengthen the capacity of the Abyei Police Service by providing assistance for the design and start-up of the Abyei Police Service; developing a plan for recruitment, vetting, training and mentorship; formulating a community policing strategy aimed at increasing the confidence of the local community; and supporting improvements in the local corrections system. 34. To support the establishment and functioning of the 20 June 2011 Agreement institutions, namely the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee, the Abyei Area Administration, the Abyei Area Council and the Abyei Police Service, dedicated civilian staff will ensure the liaison with these institutions and lend support on the strategic and day-to-day level. Alongside the Force, civilian staff will also work with the two communities towards dialogue and reconciliation and will participate in monitoring the migration. 35. Mine action will continue to be a key activity of the mission in support of military patrols, the return of internally displaced persons, activities of humanitarian actors and the provision of safe administrative and resupply routes to all missions. 36. The mission will support the operational activities of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism in undertaking verification, investigation, monitoring, arbitration, liaison coordination, reporting, information exchange, patrols and by providing security, as appropriate. It will also assist and advise the Joint Mechanism in its overall coordination of planning monitoring and verification missions and facilitate liaison between the parties. The Mine Action Service will provide support for the freedom of movement of the Joint Mechanism.

The Community Liaison Office monitors and reports on various activities related to the return of the Ngok Dinka internally displaced persons, the migration of the Misseriya nomads, the presence of the Sudan Armed Forces, the police forces of the Sudan and South Sudan and of any other unauthorized armed groups coming from the north and south. The Community Liaison Office enables the mission to develop a sound understanding of the political and social dynamics between the Ngok Dinka and the Misseriya communities, as well as the related challenges, and define practical ways of assisting those communities in achieving peaceful coexistence. It will help create a dynamic and constructive partnership between the mission and the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya communities, resulting in the formulation and implementation of projects for conflict prevention, social cohesion and reconciliation. Currently there are 16 operating bases in UNISFA, which serve as field offices for the mission. Of these, nine are permanent company operating bases, and seven are temporary bases that function during the dry season. The mission undertakes several time-bound mandate activities, including the support for the orderly and peaceful seasonal migration and organized returns. A broad-based field presence will support the expeditious and successful implementation of these activities; therefore, the creation of seven new National Professional Officer posts for seven temporary operating bases is proposed. The new Associate Liaison Officer posts will supplement the nine United Nations Volunteer posts already sanctioned for the nine permanent company operating bases. Component 2: support 38. During the budget period, the component will provide effective and efficient logistical, administrative and technical services to support the implementation of the mission's mandate. This includes personnel administration, maintenance and construction of office and accommodation facilities, communications and information technology, air and surface transport operations, medical services, property management, camp services, supply and resupply operations and security services. 2.1 Increased efficiency and effectiveness of logistical, administration and security support to the mission 2.1.1 Completion of an additional 5 military company operating bases and 1 border monitoring headquarters 2.1.2 Progress on IPSAS and Umoja implementation Service improvements :: Year 3 of a 3-year establishment plan for the mission comprising the construction of 7 locations :: Support for the implementation of IPSAS, including the re-engineering of business processes for IPSAS compliance, updating mission standard operating procedures to reflect IPSAS requirements and training all finance, budget and property management staff in the mission :: Support for the implementation of Umoja, including legacy system data quality analyses and data cleansing in the mission Military, police and civilian personnel :: Emplacement, rotation and repatriation of an average strength of 3,975 military contingent personnel, 225 military observers and 50 United Nations police officers :: Verification, monitoring and inspection of contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment for the military and police personnel :: Administration of an average of 276 civilian staff, comprising 146 international staff, 97 national staff and 33 United Nations Volunteers :: Implementation of a conduct and discipline programme for all military, police and civilian personnel including training, prevention, monitoring and disciplinary action Facilities and infrastructure :: Construction of 7,500 m2 of two-storey hard-walled office buildings for the new United Nations House at Abyei for the force headquarters administration, 1 level 1 clinic for civilian staff, conference/meeting rooms and a cafeteria, hard-walled staff living accommodation for 89 international staff, 22 United Nations Volunteers, 29 communications and information technology contractors, 87 staff officers, 40 United Nations military observers, 50 United Nations police, 25 aircrew members and 15 transit units :: Construction of 6 military camps for 660 troops, 9 international staff, 2 United Nations Volunteers, 10 national staff and 140 United Nations military observers to support the Joint Border Verification Monitoring Mechanism :: Construction of a 2,000-metre airstrip, taxiway and apron with helipads at 7 locations;

The proposed new contracts management post (Field Service) in Assosa will assist the Procurement Section in establishing all of the new UNISFA contracts for vendors operating in Assosa. The current Contracts Management Unit structure provides for the effective monitoring of UNISFA contracts before the mandate was expanded to establish the Joint Border Verification Monitoring Mechanism. Given the mandate expansion to support the Joint Mechanism, located in Assosa, the Unit is not able to effectively monitor and manage the increased number of contracts. The Unit does not have any post for or in Assosa. The proposed new post will be directly involved in the creation of new contracts, monitoring existing contracts, conducting site visits, coordinating performance evaluations and monitoring contractual progress. He/she will work closely with two international staff (1 P-3, 1 Field Service) and one United Nations Volunteer in the UNISFA Contracts Management Unit, located in Entebbe. International staff: establishment of 1 P-3 position, and the reclassification of a P4 post to a P-3 post 40. The mission is proposing the establishment of a temporary Finance Officer (P3) position, only for the 2013/14 period, to accommodate the temporary workload surrounding the implementation of IPSAS and Umoja. 41. During the 2013/14 period, the Chief Financial Officer function will be transferred from the mission to the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe. The mission proposes reclassifying the current Chief Financial Officer post (P-4) to a Finance Officer (P-3) to support the needs of the mission in conjunction with the Regional Service Centre. International staff: establishment of 3 P-3 and 12 Field Service positions; establishment of 1 Field Service post Engineering Section 42. To support the mission's mandate to monitor 2,200 km of the Sudan/South Sudan border, the Engineering Section has revised the mission's construction master plan to include the construction of six new camps along the border. In addition, the 2013/14 budget includes the construction of one 2,000-metre airstrip with apron and seven helipads at separate locations. The Section has also been tasked with improving the living conditions of the tenants to ensure that all living quarters meet United Nations standard living conditions as described in the global field support strategy. To support the mission's construction plan, it is proposed that 15 temporary positions be established, including one Architect (P-3) to support the design of the new and major projects, two Project Engineers (P-3) responsible for the planning and management of the new engineering projects and 12 Engineering Technicians (Field Service) to support both the construction of the six camps along the Sudan/ South Sudan border and to support the construction of six company operating bases in the Abyei Area (3 company operating bases and 3 temporary operating bases). 43. The Engineering Section is currently staffed to support only the planning and construction of major mission camps, the frequent repair of 75 km of dirt supply routes and daily routine engineering tasks. The additional requirements are necessary to accelerate the mission's construction plan timeline, but will only be needed for a surge period of 12 to 24 months. Property Management Section 44. The requirement for contingent-owned equipment and United Nations-owned equipment property inspections will be expanded owing to the increase in deployment locations along the Sudan/South Sudan border. The mission cannot perform timely inspections at all sites and carry out all reporting and the immediate update of equipment data for periodic reports in electronic contingent-owned equipment format. 45. It is proposed to establish a total of three new posts comprising one Contingent-Owned Equipment Assistant (Field Service) and two Property Control Inventory Assistants (1 United Nations Volunteer and 1 national General Service staff). The new posts will establish Property Control Inventory Unit operations in Kadugli to cover all the Joint Border Verification Monitoring Mechanism sectors and team sites close to Kadugli. All the new posts will perform tasks related to inventory and inspection, staff check-in and check-out and provide Galileo business object support. The Contingent-Owned Equipment Assistant will also perform physical inspections of the contingent-owned equipment and report the findings back to the Chief of the Property Management Section, prepare reports and manage the electronic contingent-owned equipment database. The two Property Control Inventory Assistants will also carry out 100 per cent physical inspection of United Nations-owned equipment. All the new posts will follow up on pending asset cases and close the cases of "not located" assets and those reported lost, with appropriate actions in a timely manner. The absence of these posts increases the potential for inaccurate reporting, and the mismanagement of the mission's assets and could delay reporting of contingent-owned equipment. Regional Service Centre in Entebbe 46. The results-based-budgeting framework for the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe reflects indicators of achievement and outputs for the peacekeeping operations and special political missions that will be receiving services from the Regional Service Centre in respect of the functions that were identified for transfer to the Centre in 2011/12 and 2012/13: processing of education grants, aspects of field-based payroll, payments, cashier, accounts, check-in and check-out of field personnel, international recruitment, post management, time and attendance, the operation of a regional training and conference centre and the operation of the Transportation and Movement Integrated Control Centre. 2.2 Effective and efficient check-in/check-out support to clients 2.2.1 Reduction of time required for check-in of international and United Nations Volunteers personnel (2011/12: more than 95 per cent completed in 2 days;

Budget year is 1 July to 30 June.) United Nations police National staff General temporary assistance Consultants Official travel Special equipment Other supplies, services and equipment B. Efficiency gains 47. The cost estimates for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 take into account the following efficiency initiatives: (Thousands of United States dollars) Initiative UNISFA currently utilizes prefabricated structures transferred from UNMIS, most of which are deteriorated and leaking. By building a secondary roof on the top of the prefabricated structure, the mission will extend the useful life of the structures as well as prevent leakage. The secondary roof is expected to reflect the sun's direct light off of the structure, reducing the fuel consumption requirements of the generator needed to power the structure's air conditioner C. Vacancy factors 48. The cost estimates for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 take into account the following vacancy factors: (Percentage) Actual 2011/12a Budgeted 2012/13 Projected 2013/14 National Professional Officers National General Service staff Temporary positionsb a Based on 2011/12 monthly incumbency and planned monthly strength. 49. The proposed vacancy factors are based on experience to date and take into account mission-specific circumstances in relation to the deployment of uniformed personnel and the recruitment of civilian staff. Specifically in determining the rates for 2013/14, variables which were considered include the current vacancy rates, the rate of deployment or recruitment for the duration of the current fiscal year to date, as well as the circumstances UNISFA is expected to face in the budget period. D. Contingent-owned equipment: major equipment and self-sustainment 50. Requirements for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 are based on standard reimbursement rates for major equipment (wet-lease) and self-sustainment in the total amount of $39,246,300 as follows: Estimated amount Major equipment Formed police units Self-sustainment Mission factors Effective date Last review date A. Applicable to Mission area Extreme environmental condition factor 27 June 2011 Intensified operational condition factor Hostile action/forced abandonment factor B. Applicable to home country Incremental transportation factor E. Training 51. The estimated resource requirements for training for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 are as follows: Training consultants Official travel, training Training fees, supplies and services 52. The number of participants planned for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014, compared with previous periods, is as follows: (Number of participants) Actual 2011/12 Planned 2012/13 Internal Externala a Includes United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and outside the mission area. 53. Training will be provided to international and national staff as well as UNISFA military and police personnel in order to upgrade various substantive and technical skills in such areas as administration, communications, air transportation and security. F. Mine detection and mine-clearing services 54. The estimated resource requirements for mine detection and mine-clearing services for the period 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 are as follows: Estimated value Mine detection and mine-clearing equipment Mine detection and mine-clearing supplies 55. During the 2013/14 period, the focus of demining activities will be in the area of detection and clearance of landmines and explosive remnants of war in areas identified as being of operational importance to the mission. 56. The proposed resource requirements of $18,227,600 for mine detection and mine-clearing services include funding for international and national staff: contracts for one route assessment and verification team to access and clear existing main roads, two multitasking teams for surveying and clearing priority areas, and 10 route verification teams to accompany joint border monitoring ground patrol and investigation teams; official travel; equipment; operational expenses and the support and management fees for the United Nations Office for Project Services. G. Quick-impact projects 57. The estimated resource requirements for quick-impact projects for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014, compared with previous periods, are as follows: Period Number of projects 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (actual) 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 (approved) 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (proposed) 58. A provision of $250,000 is proposed for the implementation of 10 projects: 5 projects for the rehabilitation of classrooms, the provision of furniture and the repair of sanitation facilities and 5 projects for the rehabilitation of health clinics and the provision of clinic furniture. H. Regional Service Centre in Entebbe: financial resources III. Analysis of variances 59. The standard terminology applied with respect to the analysis of resources variances in this section are defined in annex I.B of the present report. The terminology used remains the same as in previous reports. :: Management: increased inputs, increased outputs 60. The increased requirements are the result of the increase in the deployment of military observers from the current strength of 135 to 225 in 2013/14. In addition, a lower delayed deployment factor of 2 per cent is being used in 2013/14, compared with 25 per cent used in 2012/13. :: Management: decreased inputs, decreased outputs 61. The lower requirements are attributable primarily to the reduced deployment of contingent troops. In order to adequately monitor the 2,200 km border between the Sudan and South Sudan, the mission is reducing the number of military contingent personnel by 90 and replacing them with military observers, who will be deployed to the border area. The reduced troop strength subsequently reduces the requirements needed for troop reimbursement, travel on emplacement, rotation and repatriation and contingent-owned equipment. 62. The increased requirements are attributable primarily to the updated salary scale for international staff, increased requirements for danger pay and a lower delayed recruitment factor of 20 per cent being used in 2013/14, compared with the 30 per cent used 2012/13. In addition, the 2013/14 budget provides for three additional international posts (1 P-4 and 2 Field Service). 63. The increased requirements are attributable primarily to the salaries and common staff costs related to the proposal of eight additional posts. 64. The increased requirements are attributable primarily to more accurate estimation of cost requirements, and one additional United Nations Volunteer post. 65. The increased requirements are attributable to the proposal for 16 temporary positions. Three P-3 and 12 Field Service positions are required as a surge measure to accelerate the pace of the construction programme. An additional P-3 position is necessary to accommodate the temporary workload caused by the implementation of IPSAS and Umoja. 66. The variance is attributable primarily to the need for a business continuity consultant. The business continuity plan will take into account the wide-ranging social, political and economic impacts of the mission's environment, including a risk assessment of UNISFA operations. Critical activities will be analysed enabling the preparation of a business continuity plan that will provide operational resiliency in instances of a crisis. 67. The variance is attributable primarily to increased travel requirements for both non-training and training-related travel. It also reflects the mission's ability to better capture and anticipate travel requirements. 68. The variance is attributable primarily to increased requirements with respect to (a) the accelerated pace of construction after continued rain delays and an expanding 2013/14 construction plan; and (b) petrol, oil and lubricants to accommodate additional contingent-owned and United Nations-owned equipment. These additional requirements are offset in part by the reduced requirements for the acquisition of prefabricated and miscellaneous facilities and generators in 2013/14. 69. The variance stems primarily from the additional requirements related to the higher number of planned flight hours, increasing from 4,941 to 10,385 hours, and the ensuing increase in fuel consumption from 4.2 million to 7.9 million litres. In addition, the estimates for 2013/14 take into account the terms and conditions of utilized contracts, now that these are available. :: Management: reduced inputs, increased outputs 70. The variance is attributable primarily to the reduced requirements for the acquisition of communications equipment. The reduced requirements are offset in part by requirements to expand the Internet bandwidth, and the acquisition of public information equipment in 2013/14. :: Management: reduced inputs, same outputs 71. The variance is attributable primarily to the reduced requirements for the acquisition of information technology equipment. The reduced requirements are offset in part by additional requirements for the use of satellite imagery to support the mission's border monitoring support role. 72. The variance is attributable primarily to the increase in supplies associated with the acquisition of a level 1 clinic and the additional services the mission is expected to provide. :: Cost parameters 73. The variance is attributable primarily to more accurate estimates for freight charges for 2013/14, including the use of actual costs experienced, and an increase in mine action requirements. IV. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 74. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the mission are: (a) Appropriation of the amount of $305,351,200 for the maintenance of the mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014; (b) Assessment of the amount in paragraph (a) above at a monthly rate of $25,455,933, should the Security Council decide to continue the mandate of the mission. and requests and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions endorsed by the General Assembly A. General Assembly Cross-cutting issues (Resolution 66/264) Decision/request Action taken to implement decision/request Notes some recent improvements in the vacancy and turnover rates for civilian staff, while recognizing scope for improvement, and therefore requests the Secretary-General to ensure that vacant posts are filled expeditiously (para. 21) The mission was able to demonstrate progress in filling international civilian vacancies more expeditiously, since visa restrictions were eased on UNISFA. For instance, in March 2012 the international civilian vacancy rate stood at 48.5 per cent; in June 2012 at 29.9 per cent and by September had reached 8 per cent (using the 2011/12 baseline of 97), representing a net increase of 43 staff in the 5-month period Underlines the importance of the Secretary-General comprehensively reviewing the civilian staffing requirements for each peacekeeping mission, with particular attention to the feasibility of nationalizing Field Service posts and improving the ratio of substantive to support staff, in particular when there is a significant change in mandate or authorized force levels, to ensure that the civilian staffing structure is appropriate to effectively implement the current mission mandate and that it reflects staffing best practices across missions (para. 23) The mission faced challenges deploying civilian staff to Abyei, making the ratio of substantive to support staff difficult to improve as UNISFA has a limited substantive civilian component. Whenever possible the use of national staff has been promoted, and the 2013/14 budget provides for 8 additional national staff posts Welcomes improvements regarding, inter alia, the physical verification of non-expendable property, stresses the importance of strengthening the full cycle of supply chain management within peacekeeping operations, and in this regard reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to strengthen internal controls in the management of those assets to ensure adequate safeguards that would prevent waste and financial loss to the Organization (para. 30) UNISFA continues to implement this recommendation. UNISFA has sought to boost capacity in the area of property management by increasing the number of staff active in the mission area responsible for the verification and reconciliation of United Nations-owned equipment and contingent-owned equipment in the mission. Delays in securing visas for international staff members and volunteers has impacted progress Requests the Secretary-General to ensure the application of liberty usage guidelines for all mission vehicles and to report thereon in the next overview report on the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (para. 31) Implemented. UNISFA has established a Compliance and Monitoring Unit to ensure effective conduct and support for all mission cross-cutting compliance and monitoring functions. The Unit is tasked with strengthening internal controls and improving financial and managerial accountability, including the establishment of a monitoring mechanism for liberty usage of mission vehicles, where applicable Financing of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (Resolution 66/241 B) Decisions and requests to the Secretary-General Action taken to implement decisions and requests Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that all planned construction projects are completed on schedule and that Headquarters provides effective oversight of the major construction projects (para. 9) UNISFA will ensure compliance by fully utilizing the available resources and obtaining the necessary requirements to ensure that major construction projects are commenced and completed on schedule Expresses deep concern over the current high vacancy rates, especially for civilian personnel and United Nations police, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that vacant posts are filled expeditiously (para. 10) The mission has encountered serious challenges in deploying United Nations police in the absence of the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee's agreement to create the Abyei Area Administration and the Abyei Police Service B. Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/66/718) Request/recommendation Action taken to implement request/recommendation To facilitate an assessment of the impact of efficiency measures on budget implementation, the Advisory Committee is of the view that, where applicable, in the context of the analysis of variances, budget performance reports should include details of savings resulting from the implementation of efficiency measures (para. 19) The mission recognizes the difference between underexpenditures in general and genuine savings. In that light, it has made all efforts to implement this recommendation as requested by the Advisory Committee The Advisory Committee is of the view that, in the preparation of the budget performance reports for the 2011/12 period, a distinction must be made between any savings which derive from the implementation of efficiency measures and underexpenditures resulting from other factors (para. 23) The mission has made all efforts to implement this recommendation as requested by the Advisory Committee The Advisory Committee welcomes efforts to identify cross-cutting targets for resource reductions and to critically examine proposals for capital expenditures by field mission, and notes the assurance given that the particular circumstances pertaining to each peacekeeping operation were taken into account during budget preparation. The Committee considers, however, that the budget proposals should have provided more information on how those measures are going to be applied by each mission, including, where appropriate, any mitigating measures planned to ensure that there would be no impact on mandate implementation (para. 33) The mission has established working partnerships with neighbouring missions to leverage United Nations contracting and purchase power for cross-cutting items such as fuel, in an effort to achieve further savings for all participating missions In this regard, the Advisory Committee also cautions against equating the deferral of capital expenditures with the implementation of sustainable efficiency measures that are based on changes in business processes which enable the more cost-efficient delivery of mandates. The Advisory Committee further expects that careful planning will be undertaken to ensure that any restoration of delayed capital expenditures during the 2012/13 period does not create a significant additional financial burden on Member States in subsequent financial periods (para. 34) Mindful of corporate endeavours such as Umoja, the mission is not promoting or advocating any capital expenditure on competing alternatives that could alleviate the well-documented limitations of the existing platform or serve as interim temporary solutions The Advisory Committee is of the view that the delayed deployment factors and vacancy rates to be applied should be based on fully justified budgetary assumptions that take into account both historical data and foreseeable factors. In this regard, clear justification should be provided in budget documents for the rates used, particularly when these differ from the actual rates at the time of budget preparation (para. 36) This recommendation has been implemented. The delayed deployment and recruitment factors used in the 2013/14 budget take into account all relevant factors, including the actual average vacancy rates for each category of mission personnel in the most recent completed performance period, the actual average vacancy rate for each category of mission personnel in the currently ongoing budget period and other relevant mission-specific information provided by the Department of Field Support in relation to the generation and deployment of uniformed personnel and the recruitment of civilian staff that would affect vacancy rates, as reflected in the planned deployment schedules of military and civilian personnel The Committee notes the reduction in the provision for official travel but is of the view that requirements in this area should continue to be kept under close review. While the Committee accepts that the effective delivery of mandates necessitates travel, it is concerned about the disruption to the day-to-day work of staff and the possible impact on programme delivery of prolonged absences from duty stations. As such, the Committee considers that maximum use should be made of advances in information and communications technology and other methods of representation to reduce the need for travel. The Committee has also raised particular concerns about the level of training-related travel being undertaken (para. 138) The entry-into-Sudan protocol, along with the centralization of the check-in procedure in Entebbe, have resulted in increased requirements for travel. UNISFA mitigated these requirements by increasing the usage of video and teleconference equipment for meetings that previously required travel. The mission is also exploring different media options, such as Internet-based conferencing applications, to further reduce costs and improve productivity Financing of the United Nations Interim Security for Abyei (A/66/718/Add.12) The Advisory Committee expects that all outstanding death and disability claims will be settled expeditiously (para. 6) All claims for death and disability have been certified and paid within 90 days, in accordance with the General Assembly requirement The Advisory Committee urges the Secretary-General to ensure that all the remaining vacant posts are filled as soon as possible (para. 7) The mission continues to deploy international staff at an increased pace, as the obstacles the mission faces in obtaining visas for international staff have subsided. The full deployment of military personnel is expected following the signature of the status-of-forces agreement between the United Nations and the Government of the Sudan In this connection, the Advisory Committee encourages the mission to draw lessons from other missions, such as the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), which has already established community alert networks as an early warning system of imminent threats in the communities (para. 11) UNISFA implemented a CarLog system for vehicle control, and utilizes the INDIGO flight-monitoring system to track all UNISFA flights. These systems have been proven successful in other missions, for example the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, MONUSCO and United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi. The proposed construction of hard-wall accommodations in 2013/14 will be built utilizing concepts developed by UNMISS The Advisory Committee is concerned that the granting of visas for UNISFA personnel and the status-of-forces agreement will have an impact on the effective implementation of the mandate of UNISFA, and encourages the Secretary-General to actively pursue the conclusion of the discussions on the pending matters in a timely manner (para. 12) UNISFA implemented this recommendation and signed the status-of-forces agreement with the Government of the Sudan on 1 October 2012. This agreement is expected to further facilitate the deployment of staff and the implementation of the mission's mandate Given the security situation in the Abyei Area, the Advisory Committee considers that the indicators of achievement under component 1 could be improved in order to better reflect what could realistically be accomplished by the mission itself and activities for which the mission could be held accountable (para. 35) The mission has made a thorough review of the indicators, ensuring that they are simple, measurable, agreed between programme managers, realistic and timely The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-General's proposals under component 2, support. In this connection, bearing in mind the Board of Auditors' repeated audit findings across missions regarding property management and discrepancies in physical verifications of assets, the Committee expects that the provision of capacity in this area would enable the mission to ensure effective stewardship of assets (para. 51). UNISFA has taken significant steps to control non-expendable property in Abyei and the rest of the mission area. It has set up and staffed a Property Management Section to deal with all pending issues with United Nations-owned equipment and contingent-owned equipment. Similarly the mission is implementing measures to ensure better accountability of United Nations-owned equipment, and arranging for improved storage and issuance of these assets by specialized asset managers. The mission has improved the quality of assets reporting and has embarked on an effort to receive, verify and inspect all United Nations-owned equipment transferred from UNMIS to UNISFA Since July 2011, the mission has succeeded in the timely arrival and periodic inspections of UNISFA military contingent-owned equipment A. Terminology related to proposed changes in human resources The following terminology has been applied with respect to proposed changes in human resources (see sect. I): :: Post establishment. The establishment of a new post is proposed when additional resources are necessary and when it is not possible to redeploy resources from other offices or otherwise accommodate specific activities from within existing resources. :: Post reassignment. An approved post that was intended to cover a certain function is proposed to implement other priority mandated activities unrelated to the original function. While a post reassignment may involve a change of location or office, it does not change the category or level of the post. :: Post redeployment. The redeployment of an approved post is proposed to cover comparable or related functions in another office. :: Post reclassification. The reclassification of an approved post is proposed (upgraded or downgraded) when the duties and responsibilities of the post have changed substantially. :: Post abolishment. The abolishment of an approved post is proposed if it is no longer needed to implement the activities for which it was approved or to implement other priority mandated activities within the mission. :: Post conversion. Three possible options for post conversion are as follows: :: Conversion of general temporary assistance positions to posts: approved positions financed under general temporary assistance are proposed for conversion to posts if the functions being performed are of a continuing nature. :: Conversion of individual contractors or individuals on procurement contracts to national staff posts: taking into account the continuing nature of certain functions, in line with section VIII, paragraph 11, of General Assembly resolution 59/296, individual contractors or individuals on procurement contracts are proposed for conversion to national staff posts. :: Conversion of international staff posts to national staff posts: approved international staff posts are proposed for conversion to national staff posts.
