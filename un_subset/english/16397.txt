General Assembly Fifty-sixth session Agenda item 42 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Fifty-seventh year Letter dated 24 April 2002 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to inform you that at 1425 hours Beirut time on 24 April 2002 Israeli warplanes overflew the liberated villages in the Tyre area, thus violating Lebanese sovereignty and the Blue Line, and also overflew other parts of Lebanon. These aerial violations confirm that Israel is persisting in its provocations and continuing its aggression against Lebanon. They are in flagrant violation of Security Council resolution 425 (1978), and they may pose a threat to security and stability in the region. I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 42, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Houssam Asaad Diab Chargé d'affaires a.i.
