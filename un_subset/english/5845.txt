UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1998/885 23 September 1998 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 22 SEPTEMBER 1998 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SUDAN TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL I have the honour to attach herewith an article published in The New York Times of 21 September 1998 in which the paper stated that the decision of the United States of America to strike the factory in Sudan was based on surmise (see annex). The paper reported that some top American officials now believe that the reasons for bombing the factory were not convincing. I should be grateful if you could circulate the present letter and its annex as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Elfatih ERWA Permanent Representative
