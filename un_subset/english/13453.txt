Resolution 1171 (1998) The United Nations Arms Embargoes (Amendment) (Sierra Leone) Order 1998 (Statutory Instrument (SI) No. 1501/1998) came into force on 26 June 1998 and imposes restrictions on the supply or delivery of arms and related material to Sierra Leone or to, or to the order of, any person connected with Sierra Leone. The Order applies to any person within the United Kingdom, any person elsewhere who is a British citizen and any entities incorporated or constituted under United Kingdom law. Similar Orders impose the same restrictions in relation to the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. Resolution 1306 (2000) The prohibition on the direct or indirect import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Lone is implemented in the United Kingdom by means of an amendment to The Open General Import Licence which came into force on 17 July 2000. It is implemented in a similar manner in the Isle of Man. It is implemented in the other Crown Dependencies by the Sierra Leone (United Nations Sanctions) (Channel Islands) Order 2000 (SI 2000/1840) and in the Overseas Territories by the Sierra Leone (United Nations Sanctions) (Overseas Territories) Order 2000 (SI 2000/1822), both of which came into force on 14 July 2000. You will also wish to be aware of the decision by States members of the European Union to implement the measures imposed by resolution 1306 (2000) at the Community level. Common Position 455/2000 concerning a prohibition on imports of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone came into force on 20 July 2000 and EC regulation 1745/2000 on the importation into the Community of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone came into force on 8 August.
