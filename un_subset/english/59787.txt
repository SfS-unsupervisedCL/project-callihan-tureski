As already indicated in the joint UNDP/UNFPA letter of 8 July 2011 to the Executive Board, prior agreement had been reached with the administration of South Sudan to take steps to continue, on an exceptional basis, the implementation of ongoing critical programmes during an interim period following independence and prior to the approval of the first country programme documents. In line with the South Sudan Development Plan 2011-2013, United Nations agencies will work towards realigning their programming priorities and preparing new country programme documents (CPDs) by October 2011. While CPDs are not ordinarily reviewed and approved at the first regular session of the Executive Board, the Government of South Sudan has requested that the Executive Board agree, on an exceptional basis, for draft CPDs to be presented and approved at the January 2012 meeting of the Executive Board. The Administrator urges the Board to accept these proposed arrangements for UNDP. Finally, the Government of South Sudan has confirmed its assent that the UNDP South Sudan country office be placed within the UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa.
