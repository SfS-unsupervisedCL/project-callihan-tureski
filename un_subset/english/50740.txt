United Nations DP/FPA/2009/2 (Part I,)/ Add.1) Annual session 2009 26 May to 5 June 2009, New York Item 12 of the provisional agenda UNFPA - Annual report of the Executive Director for 2008 UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND Statistical and financial review, 2008* Summary From 2007 to 2008, total income to UNFPA increased by $93.1 million, or 12.4 per cent, to $845.3 million. UNFPA resources surpassed the $500 million level for the fifth sequential year, including $469.5 million in regular resources, the highest total ever in the history of UNFPA. Increased and predictable core resources are necessary to enable UNFPA to deliver its programmes to help countries attain the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and the Millennium Declaration, as well as the commitments made at the 2005 World Summit, including achieving universal access to reproductive health by 2015. UNFPA will continue to focus its programme delivery on supporting and promoting national ownership and capacity-building. With respect to the funding base, UNFPA will continue to focus on increasing and achieving greater stability and predictability in contributions to regular resources, which are the foundation and bedrock of the Fund's operations. Regular resource contribution income increased by $9.8 million, or 2.3 per cent, from 2007 to 2008 as reflected in annex 1, table 24. Total expenditure increased by $72.9 million, or 11.6 per cent, to $701.9 million in 2008. Of that increase, $51.4 million (70.5 per cent) was attributable to increased programme activities. The balance of unexpended regular resources at the end of 2008 after adjustment for unfunded liabilities for staff benefits was $25.4 million (in 2007 it was $64.0 million). This amount is 5.4 per cent of regular resources income and is available for programming in 2009. The operational reserve was replenished in accordance with applicable UNFPA Financial Regulations and Rules, taking into account Executive Board decision 2007/43. UNFPA closed the year 2008 in robust financial health. * The compilation of data required to provide the Executive Board with the most current information has delayed the submission of the present report.
