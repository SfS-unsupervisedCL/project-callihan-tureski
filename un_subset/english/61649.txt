General Assembly Security Council Sixty-sixth session Agenda item 35 Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and development Sixty-seventh year Identical letters dated 27 April 2012 from the Permanent Representative of Georgia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council I have the honour to transmit herewith a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia dated 26 April 2012, regarding the postponement of the April 24 Gali meeting of the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex issued as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 35. (Signed) Alexander Lomaia Ambassador Permanent Representative of Georgia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia regarding the postponement of the April 24 Gali meeting of the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia expresses its deep concern regarding the postponement of the April 24 Gali meeting of the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms and regarding the imminent danger of not having the European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) participate in the future meetings of the Mechanisms. The Georgian side wants to stress the importance of the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms (IPRMs) as key instruments for dispelling tensions on the ground and confidence building. It is totally unacceptable that Moscow and its proxy regimes are attempting to unilaterally change the format and modalities of the meetings, thus undermining the whole process of the Geneva international discussions. Procedural and agenda-related aspects of the IPRMs and Geneva meetings have been agreed by all participants and observance of the established rules is absolutely crucial for maintaining smooth continuation of the negotiation process. The responsibility for hampering, or breakdown of, the dialogue formats will rest solely with Moscow. The Georgian side would like to stress that the recent démarche against EUMM is just one component in the chain of actions aimed at diminishing the role of the international organizations acting in Georgia. The postponement of the Gali IPRM was preceded by the continuous attempts of Moscow to limit the role of EUMM and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the Tskhinvali IPRM, as well as barring the entry of EUMM monitors to the occupied regions and refusing the establishment of a strong United Nations and OSCE presence on the ground. These and other démarches against EUMM clearly demonstrate that the Russian side is uncomfortable with a neutral and impartial international presence on the territory of Georgia. The Georgian side calls on Moscow to ensure that the work of the IPRMs and the Geneva international discussions proceeds in an unhindered way and that the objections regarding the role of EUMM in the IPRMs and the Geneva international discussions are promptly removed. The Georgian side also calls on the international community to adequately assess the situation and engage in a serious dialogue with Moscow over the importance of fulfilling existing international obligations, including the withdrawal of the Russian troops and allowing the international monitors to the occupied regions.
