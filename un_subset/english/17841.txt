General Assembly Tenth emergency special session Agenda item 5 Illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory Security Council Fifty-seventh year Identical letters dated 1 February 2002 from the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council In an interview published on Thursday, 31 January 2002, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that Israel should have killed the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat 20 years ago in Beirut when the city was under Israeli siege. Mr. Sharon said, "In principle, I am sorry that we did not liquidate him." This dangerous and condemnable statement comes while Israeli occupying forces continue to impose a siege on the headquarters of President Arafat on top of the siege imposed on the whole Palestinian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, 72 permanent Israeli checkpoints exist in the West Bank and 9 exist in the Gaza Strip. This is apart from the virtual isolation of many Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps. Today, the Israeli Minister of Tourism, Benny Elon, threatened to "transfer" the Palestinians. Mr. Elon was quoted as saying, "We must not fear bringing up again the idea of a transfer and of open discussion of the various possibilities that it offers." Mr. Elon, his predecessor and their party openly advocate such racist policies of ethnic cleansing and transfer of the Palestinian people. On the other hand, Israel continues with its illegal actions in and around occupied East Jerusalem. The office of the Prime Minister issued a statement on implementing a plan to "ring Jerusalem". The plan will include trenches, fences, blockades and other measures. It will broaden the sphere of the illegally enlarged municipal boundary to include additional adjacent areas in the West Bank, such as Abu Dis, to serve as a "buffer zone". At the same time, Israel, the occupying Power, continues with its settlement activities in the city and other illegal actions in places like Bab Al-Amoud and Burj Al-Laqlaq. All of this, of course, is aimed at enforcing the judaization of the city and at preventing the establishment of the capital of Palestine in East Jerusalem. All of the above present additional evidence of the policies of Ariel Sharon and his Government, which are aimed at destroying any potential for peace and destroying the Palestinian Authority along with whatever is left of the Palestinian infrastructure. The international community must stand up to such Israeli policies and positions and must put an end to Israeli war crimes, State terrorism and other atrocities committed against the Palestinian people. In follow-up to my previous 94 letters to you regarding the Israeli bloody military campaign in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, dated from 29 September 2000 to 22 January 2002 (A/55/432-S/2000/921; A/55/437-S/2000/930; A/55/450-S/2000/957; A/55/466-S/2000/971; A/55/474-S/2000/984; A/55/490-S/2000/993; A/ES-10/39-S/2000/1015; A/ES-10/40-S/2000/1025; A/ES10/42-S/2000/1068; A/ES-10/43-S/2000/1078; A/ES-10/44-S/2000/1093; A/ES-10/45-S/2000/1104; A/ES-10/46-S/2000/1107; A/ES-10/47-S/2000/1116; A/ES-10/48-S/2000/1129; A/ES-10/49-S/2000/1154; A/ES-10/50-S/2000/1173; A/ES-10/51-S/2000/1185; A/ES-10/52-S/2000/1206; A/ES-10/53-S/2000/1247; A/ES-10/54-S/2001/7; A/ES-10/55-S/2001/33; A/ES-10/56-S/2001/50; A/ES-10/57-S/2001/101; A/ES-10/58-S/2001/131; A/ES-10/59-S/2001/156; A/ES-10/60-S/2001/175; A/ES-10/61-S/2001/189; A/ES-10/64-S/2001/209; A/ES-10/65-S/2001/226; A/ES-10/66-S/2001/239; A/ES-10/67-S/2001/255; A/ES-10/68-S/2001/284; A/ES-10/69-S/2001/295; A/ES-10/70-S/2001/304; A/ES-10/71-S/2001/314; A/ES-10/72-S/2001/332; A/ES-10/75-S/2001/352; A/ES-10/76-S/2001/372; A/ES-10/79-S/2001/418; A/ES-10/80-S/2001/432; A/ES-10/81-S/2001/447; A/ES-10/82-S/2001/463; A/ES-10/83-S/2001/471; A/ES-10/84-S/2001/479; A/ES-10/85-S/2001/486; A/ES-10/86-S/2001/496; A/ES-10/87-S/2001/504; A/ES-10/88-S/2001/508; A/ES-10/89-S/2001/544; A/ES-10/90-S/2001/586; A/ES-10/91-S/2001/605; A/ES-10/92-S/2001/629; A/ES-10/93-S/2001/657; A/ES-10/94-S/2001/669; A/ES-10/95-S/2001/686; A/ES-10/96-S/2001/697; A/ES-10/97-S/2001/708; A/ES-10/98-S/2001/717; A/ES-10/99-S/2001/742; A/ES-10/100-S/2001/754; A/ES-10/101-S/2001/783; A/ES-10/102-S/2001/785; A/ES-10/103-S/2001/798; A/ES-10/104-S/2001/812; A/ES-10/105-S/2001/814; A/ES-10/107-S/2001/821; A/ES-10/108-S/2001/826; A/ES-10/111-S/2001/880; A/ES-10/112-S/2001/918; A/ES-10/114-S/2001/928; A/ES-10/115-S/2001/932; A/ES-10/116-S/2001/941; A/ES-10/117-S/2001/971; A/ES-10/118-S/2001/989; A/ES-10/119-S/2001/991; A/ES-10/121-S/2001/1007; A/ES-10/122-S/2001/1024; A/ES-10/123-S/2001/1036; A/ES-10/124-S/2001/1084; A/ES-10/125-S/2001/1092; A/ES-10/126-S/2001/1118; A/ES-10/128-S/2001/1149; A/ES-10/129-S/2001/1166; A/ES-10/133-S/2001/1239; A/ES-10/134-S/2001/1261; A/ES-10/136-S/2002/18; A/ES-10/137-S/2002/39; A/ES-10/138-S/2002/48; A/ES-10/139-S/2002/58; A/ES-10/140-S/2002/89; A/ES-10/141-S/2002/95; A/ES-10/142-S/2002/102 and A/ES-10/142-S/2002/121), I regret to inform you that since my last letter the Israeli occupying forces have killed eight more Palestinians.
