Reaffirm the importance of achieving the Millennium Development Goals within their timeframe and their concern that some countries may not be in a position to do so in view of lack of adequate financial and technical resources; Reaffirm the Principles of the Declaration of Rio on Environment and Development, in particular those relating to the sovereign right of Countries to take advantage of their own resources according to their policies on environment and development as well as to the common but differentiated responsibilities of the Countries, based on their historical contribution toward the degradation of the global environment; Reaffirm the decisions of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) and the proposals for action identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF) and the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF), and the importance of ongoing efforts to implement such actions; Reaffirm also ECOSOC resolution 2000/35 which states that the main objective of the international arrangement on forests is to promote the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests and to strengthen long term political commitment to this end; Understand that the purpose of the non-legally binding international arrangement on forests should be: to promote the implementation of internationally agreed actions on forests, at the national, regional and global levels, to provide a coherent, transparent and participatory global framework for policy implementation, coordination and development, and to carry out principal functions, based on the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the Non-legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests (Forest Principles), Chapter 11 of Agenda 21, and the Proposals for Action adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests and the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests, in a manner consistent with and complementary to existing international legally binding instruments relevant to forests; Express their concern regarding the continued deforestation and forest degradation and its adverse impact on the livelihoods of over a billion people, including many of the poorest and most vulnerable, and the need for more effective implementation of actions to facilitate the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests; Reaffirm that the UNFF, with the assistance of the CPF, is the key inter-governmental mechanism to support, facilitate and coordinate the implementation of sustainable forest management at the national, regional and global levels, and stress the importance of its appropriate strengthening; Recognize that the implementation of policies and measures to promote the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests requires significant technical and institutional capacities, as well as considerable financial commitments; Recognize also that sufficient new and additional financial resources have yet to be channelled to support national policies and programmes aimed at the conservation, management and sustainable development of forests; Understand that policies and measures adopted at the global, regional, sub-regional and national levels should, as appropriate, enhance the capacity of countries to significantly increase the production of forest products from sustainably managed sources; Also understand that States should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that would lead to economic growth and sustainable development in all countries to better address the problems of environmental degradation. Trade policy measures for environmental purposes should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade; Reaffirm the special needs and requirements of low forest covered countries and other countries with fragile ecosystems; Agree to the following Non-Legally Binding International Understanding on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests (henceforth referred to as the "Understanding") as a voluntary instrument to enhance international cooperation and to support national, regional and sub regional policies and measures, within the International Arrangement of Forests and the mandate of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF). The Understanding builds upon the Non-Legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests. Implementation of the Understanding should take into account that Each country is responsible for the conservation and sustainable management of its forests and for the enforcement of its forest laws, which is essential to achieving sustainable forest management; International cooperation plays a crucial and catalytic role in reinforcing the efforts of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to improve the management of their forests; The private sector, forest owners, local and indigenous communities and other stakeholders can contribute to achieving sustainable forest management and should be involved in a transparent and participatory way in forest decision-making that affects them. I. Global Objectives The following Global Objectives should be achieved through the implementation of the Understanding: Reverse the loss of forest cover worldwide through sustainable forest management, including protection, restoration, afforestation and reforestation, and increase efforts to prevent forest degradation; Enhance forest-based economic, social and environmental benefits including by improving the livelihoods of forest dependent people; Increase significantly the area of protected forests worldwide and other areas of sustainably managed forests, and increase the proportion of forest products from sustainably managed forests; Reverse the decline in official development assistance for sustainable forest management and mobilize significantly increased new and additional financial resources from all sources for the implementation of sustainable forest management. II. Policies & Measures The following actions should be developed at global, regional and sub-regional levels to achieve the above mentioned global objectives: Initiating or strengthening, where appropriate, public-private partnerships with the private sector, civil society organizations, including community-based organizations, and other stakeholders to promote implementation of national forest programs, criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management, good business practices and improved market transparency; Promoting research and development of forests, by means of a network of established centres of excellence, in all regions of the world, especially in developing countries; Promoting international cooperation, including South - South cooperation, and the participation of local communities; Promoting long-term political commitments and strengthening existing commitments, which would allow countries to adopt concrete actions in institutional, economic and social fields, for the integration of conservation and sustainable forest management, within national development policies. The following actions should be developed at national level to achieve the above mentioned global objectives: Formulating, implementing, publishing and regularly updating national programs containing measures to support and increase sustainable forest management and to combat deforestation, as well as measures related to the Global Objectives contained in paragraph 4(i) to (iv) of this Understanding; Developing, periodically updating and making available to UNFF national reports on actions and instruments adopted to achieve the global objectives of this Understanding, using comparable methodologies to be agreed upon by the UNFF and taking into account reports requires by other multilateral environmental agreements; Including forests in national poverty reduction strategies and, as appropriate, in strategies to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to carry out the actions agreed upon in Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, with a view to mobilizing new and additional financial resources for international cooperation on sustainable forest management; Integrating conservation and sustainable forest management within national development policies. III. Means of Implementation In order to ensure the achievement of the Global Objectives set out in paragraph 4 above, the following means of implementation should be pursued: Securing high-level political commitment and support to provide financial and technical resources to meet the global objectives of this resolution, including by the establishment of a global financing mechanism with the aim of providing specific financial resources for achieving the objectives of this Understanding; Establishing a clearing-house mechanism to facilitate a better exchange of experiences and good practices, as well as access by developing countries to better technology for sustainable forest management and an increase of in situ added value for forest products; Promoting the transfer of technology to and capacity building in developing countries to enable them to implement national policies and measures aimed at reversing the loss of forest cover in their territories as well as significantly increase the area of protected and sustainably managed forests; Inviting the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to strengthen its role in implementing sustainable forest management by establishing a new operational program on forests, with sufficient additional funds to be allocated without prejudice to other operational programs. IV. Institutional modalities The Proposals for Action adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF) and the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF) should be fully taken into account in the development of the Global Objectives referred to in paragraph 4 above. The UNFF should periodically assess the implementation of this Understanding, review national reports, the provision of financial resources, and the adequacy of the modalities for transfer of technology, and should provide guidance for further action to achieve the objectives established above. Regional and sub-regional meetings should be held to discuss practical steps at that level for the implementation of this Understanding. Such meetings should be conducted by regional or sub-regional organizations mandated by their member States and acknowledged by the UNFF. Such meetings should be prepared jointly by the designated organizations and the UNFF Secretariat. The UNFF should continue to encourage and facilitate the participation of stakeholders from all major groups in its work, in an open and transparent way. The UNFF should agree on a multiyear programme of work for the period 2007-2015 and on the strengthening of the Secretariat to fulfil its mandate." COLOMBIA [Original: Spanish] General comments of Colombia on the negotiation of a non-legally binding instrument First, it is important to point out that the global objectives contained in document E/2006/42, such as sustainable forest management, including protection, restoration, and increased efforts to prevent forest degradation, are covered in the objectives of Colombia for its forest sector. With regard to the means of implementation, Colombia is carrying out a number of them through its National Forest Development Plan (PNDF) and the development of a forest financial strategy. For the latter, in particular, the document recognizes the importance of involving the public and private sectors as well as academia and non-governmental organizations. It also recognizes the importance of voluntary contributions It is important for the sector to enhance the transfer of technology, international assistance and collaboration and inter-institutional work with various groups, as the document proposes. In general, the document is in line with Colombia's course in the forest sector, and it is very important to recognize the positive externalities (environmental services and functions) these ecosystems provide and to promote their economic valuation. Development of the instrument With regard to the elements of the non-legally binding arrangement on forests, it is very important for Colombia to link this convention to others to which the country is party, and to other policy documents that in some way affect work with forest ecosystems. It is important that development of the instrument should take into account the proposals for forest management considered in documents such as Colombia Vision Second Centenary: 2019, the possible impact of the General Forest Law, coordination with the various management categories of the National Protected Areas System (SINAP), the Convention on Biological Diversity and the National Forest Development Plan, all of which are relevant to efforts to conserve Colombia's forest ecosystems. Conclusion In general the proposals contained in the document are in line with Colombia's needs. It is important to highlight the non-economic benefits that are obtained from forest ecosystems, and to have them recognized in the agreement and in changes they may imply for Colombia. Comments of Colombia on the non-legally binding instrument -- Ministry of Foreign Affairs The non-legally binding instrument should include the objectives agreed during the sixth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests, namely: Global Objective 1 Global Objective 2 Enhance forest-based economic, social and environmental benefits, including by improving the livelihoods of forest dependent people; Global Objective 3 Increase significantly the area of protected forests worldwide and other areas of sustainably managed forests, as well as the proportion of forest products from sustainably managed forests; Global Objective 4 It should also reaffirm Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, regarding States' common but differentiated responsibilities for the sustainable management of all types of forests, and the right of States to exploit their own resources. Colombia believes that all proposals submitted to date are quite valuable and that they contain important elements for the drafting of a non-legally binding instrument. It is necessary to make the name of the non-legally binding instrument consistent. At times it is referred to as the "non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests", while at others it is the "non-legally binding instrument on sustainable management of all types of forests and to achieve the global objectives". Colombia believes the second name should be used since the non-legally binding instrument should be directly related to its global objectives. The proposals contain a number of common elements that would help to structure the work and the analysis of the discussions. They are: 1. Preamble 2. Principles 3. Strategic objectives 4. Means of implementation 5. Institutional modalities 6. Collaboration and coordination 7. Monitoring, assessment and reporting 8. National policies and measures 9. Adoption Calls for action to other bodies, such as the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF), and other processes and organizations should be revised and limited in scope. It is also necessary to review the relevance of including operative or decision-making issues that are the responsibility of the Forum, among such issues as participation of interested parties, periodicity of sessions and review of progress achieved; It is necessary to determine what a country is commiting to when it undertakes to prepare a national report. In developing countries, the Global Forest Information Service must be strengthened so that it can deal with the requests for information generated by this type of commitment. Accordingly, the elements of such reports should be the outcome of negotiations, prepared in accordance with a feasible methodology and in keeping with achievements and capacities of the aforementioned countries; The instrument should include a section on financing for developing countries, since they do not have sufficient technical or economic resources to implement all the initiatives described therein, especially those related to the monitoring of actions and the subsequent compilation of the information required for the reports; The initiatives set out in the non-legally binding instrument continue to lack certain elements, such as those relating to the agreed means of implementation, which would allow for the achievement of the global objectives. However, one of the most ambitious proposals has been put forward by Brazil and relates to the establishment of a Global Forest Fund (see para. 7 (a)). This idea has also been taken up by, inter alia, Indonesia and South Africa, and Colombia strongly supports it; With regard to subscription to or ratification of the non-legally binding instrument, the European Union makes a very concrete proposal which is in line with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Moreover, the European Union's proposal is very comprehensive on the issues of capacity-building and the transfer of technology; Indonesia's proposal contains very important elements relating to the review of the instrument in 2015 and the importance of the transfer of technology; South Africa's proposal also addresses the idea of a Forest Fund, which Colombia wholeheartedly supports. New proposals, or new versions of proposals, for the non-legally binding instrument have been issued. Thus, we have received the initial proposals submitted by Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Switzerland and Zimbabwe. The United States has sent a new version of its proposal. Likewise, we have made specific comments on the first revised version of the European Union's proposal, which was sent by e-mail. Attention should be drawn to the following elements of the proposal submitted by the United States: As far as content is concerned, unlike the initial version it includes language for a number of paragraphs, some of which are direct quotations from the draft resolution contained in document E/2006/42. This serves to reinforce the idea that the non-legally binding instrument should incorporate previously adopted language, in order to avoid the reopening of discussions; The proposal states that the "International Understanding on Sustainable Forest Management" has been adopted to promote the sustainable management of our forests, and, despite citing the agreed global objectives, the text refers explicitly to the fact that the instrument is designed to achieve those objectives; The principles include a number of specific and appropriate elements, such as the references to the voluntary nature of the instrument and to States' sovereignty over their resources. However, several principles are expressed using terminology borrowed from preambular paragraphs, and therefore include references to the recognition of issues such as the role of international cooperation and the participation of stakeholders from the forest sector; Similarly, the principles recognize that the seven thematic elements of sustainable forest management offer a reference framework for an indicative set of criteria for sustainable forest management. This issue has been regularly brought up by the United States, despite the fact that, from a technical perspective, incorporating it into the non-legally binding instrument would not be appropriate because the decision should be taken at another level within the framework of the International Arrangement on Forests; An extensive and detailed series of national policies and measures has been included. Some of those measures are taken from the text of the draft resolution adopted by the United Nations Forum on Forests at its sixth session. However, it should be pointed out that, while it would be feasible to include some of the measures, such as the implementation of national forest programmes, the development of national strategies for the conservation and rehabilitation of forest ecosystems or the promotion of participation and empowerment in the forest sector, because they are part and parcel of the National Plan on Forest Development, other measures, such as the development of instruments or mechanisms for the financing of sustainable forest management, would be extremely difficult to implement; The proposal is very specific as far as reporting and review are concerned, stating that the instrument must undergo an effectiveness review. This will make it possible to map out the scope of the process, which must be taken forward by the United Nations Forum on Forests. The Swiss proposal contains indicative elements rather than specific paragraphs which would allow for a detailed analysis of the extent of its content. However, the section on national measures includes a reference to quantified national targets, and the section on international modalities for cooperation refers to peer reviews. Attention should be drawn to the following elements of the proposal submitted by the European Union: The preamble cites general points contained in the text of the draft resolution adopted at the sixth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests; however, it does not take the form of preambular paragraphs. It would therefore be more helpful to work with the United States' proposal on the preamble; As regards the purpose of the non-legally binding instrument, reference is made not only to what was agreed in paragraph 26 of the document adopted at the sixth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests, but also to the need to strengthen the implementation function of Economic and Social Council resolution 2000/35. Consideration should be given to whether this falls within the scope of the mandate of the non-legally binding instrument; Similarly, as far as the principles are concerned, a number of issues are alluded to but no specific language is suggested; With regard to monitoring, assessment and reporting, the proposal states that a process for facilitation, peer review and dialogue should be established in order to monitor contributions to global goals and the achievement of national targets. Thus, it would include an allusion to the adoption of national goals, as well as another reference to peer review. Various States are reluctant to accept the latter, since it would provide an opportunity for third parties to evaluate States' internal administrative policies. INDONESIA Voluntary Code on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests Recalling ECOSOC Resolution 2000/35 of 18 October 2000, and ECOSOC Resolution 2006/xxx of .July 2006; Recalling also the global objectives on forests as stipulated in ECOSOC resolution 2006/xxx; Reaffirming the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development; Chapter 11 of Agenda 21; the Non-Legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests; the proposals for action identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF) and the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF); decisions of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF); and the Johannesburg Declaration and Plan of Implementation (JPOI); Reaffirming also the sovereign right of States to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and development policies as well the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities; Recognizing that endeavours for the conservation, and sustainable management and development of all types of forests should be strengthened, so that forests and forest ecosystems contribute fully to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, taking full account of the linkages between the forestry sector and other sectors; Recognizing also the significant contribution of major groups and relevant stakeholders in efforts to planning, development and implementation of national forest policies; Expressing concern that illegal logging and its associated trade in illegally harvested forest products have reached an alarming rate that is causing the loss of revenues, ecosystems degradation, loss of biodiversity and aggravating poverty particularly in developing countries; Recognizing also the need to strengthen the interaction between the UNFF and relevant regional forest-related mechanisms, institutions and instruments, organizations and processes, with participation of major groups, as identified in Agenda 21, and relevant stakeholders to facilitate enhanced cooperation and effective implementation of sustainable forest management, as well as to contribute to the work of the Forum; Stressing the need for adequate means of implementation to effectively implement sustainable forest management and attention should be given to provide program and planning supported by adequate resources including finance, capacity building and transfer of environmentally sound technologies for developing countries including least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing states, and countries with economies in transition; Decides to adopt a Voluntary Code on the management, conservation and sustainable management of all types of forests; Resolves that the following actions should be undertaken by subscribing States at the national, regional and global level in implementing this Code: Integrate forests issues into national and international development agendas through the strengthening of institutions in support of the development and implementation of national forestry programs; Enhance policy coordination and international cooperation including South-South cooperation; Establish a more effective mechanism for program implementation and cooperation at regional and sub-regional levels; Encourage participation of all relevant stakeholders in the planning, development and implementation of national forest policies; Decides to implement this Code, including the achievement of global objectives with the following means: Increase official development assistance for forestry-related activities; Increase finance from private, public and voluntary sources; Strengthen existing forest related funds; Establish a global forest fund; Develop innovative financial mechanisms; Strengthen the capacity of developing countries for the implementation of sustainable forest management; Enhance access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and corresponding know-how on favorable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Agenda 21; Strengthen forestry education, research and development through global, regional and subregional networks, as well as relevant organizations, institutions and centers of excellence in all regions of the world, particularly in developing countries; Promote bilateral, regional and international cooperation on forest law enforcement and governance to combat illegal logging and its associated trade particularly on illegally harvested timber, non-timber products, wildlife, and other forest products; Facilitate and promote investments on maintaining sustainable forest management, reforestation, afforestation and establishing new planted forests; Decides that the Code shall be open for subscription by States and regional economic integration organizations by submitting a diplomatic note to the UNFF secretariat. This procedure applies mutatis mutandis to the withdrawal of States and regional economic integration organizations from this Code. The UNFF Secretariat should disseminate the status of States' subscription to the Voluntary Code to all members of UNFF on a periodic basis; Decides that the UNFF Secretariat will function as the Secretariat for Voluntary Code; Decides that the UNFF should meet every two years to assess the implementation of this Code, review national reports on progress of implementation and should provide policy guidance. Every alternate year, regional meetings should be held to discuss concrete measures to implement this Code at national and regional levels; Decides to review the effectiveness of this Code in 2015. Comments of the Republic of Indonesia on the Compilation Text of Country Proposals on the Nonlegally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests Recognizing the role of sustainable forest management in poverty reduction and development, Indonesia is of the view that the non-legally binding instrument (NLBI) on all types of forests should include reaffirmation of the need to enhance international cooperation through a global partnership with a view to achieving internationally agreed development goals including the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the benefits of forests towards poverty reduction. Considering the broad spectrum of Multilateral Environmental Agreements particularly the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant international treaties that cut across forest issues, the NLBI should ensure that there is no overlapping in mandates. A number of issues have already been addressed through the Convention on Biological Diversity including benefit sharing, a clearing house mechanism and invasive alien species. In this regard, Indonesia considers that these issues are more pertinent in the context of a legally binding instrument. In terms of policies and measures in the implementation of the NLBI, Indonesia is of the view that the proposals to establish a peer review and reporting mechanism would demand the development of criteria and Indicators for monitoring, assessment and reporting. Moreover, the peer review mechanism should be voluntary in nature, requiring the agreement of the concerned country or countries involved. It is also important to bear in mind that there are local issues that cannot be harmonized globally such as land tenure. Indonesia considers local issues should be under the national policy space. In terms of the Multi-year Program of Work, it should be addressed in the framework of the implementation and objectives of NLBI. JAPAN Japan's Proposal on a Non-legally Binding Instrument (NLBI) Japan's basic positions on NLBI are as follows: The objectives of NLBI should be clearly understood and shared by among all member states prior to UNFF7 through an open-ended working group and country-led initiatives, if any. Even at the very last stage of UNFF6, there still seemed to be different expectations and perception gaps on NLBI between member states. Therefore, it is extremely important to have a common understanding and a shared vision on the objectives of NLBI prior to the formal session of UNFF7. Elements of NLBI should conform to the draft resolution adopted at UNFF6.Given the fact that participants spent quite a long time and much energy at UNFF5 & 6 to come up with the draft resolution which covers almost all concerns raised by all participants, the elements we already have before us should be the basis of preparation of NLBI, to build on the efforts we made to date. Especially, the issue of illegal practices and illegal international trade under the "Means of Implementation", and the direction of strengthening collaboration with forest-related regional processes under the "Working modalities", of which importance Japan has continuously been stressing should definitely be covered by NLBI. Time-line and procedures in paragraph 26 of the draft resolution should be strictly abided by. In order to come to an agreement on NLBI within limited time frame, Japan stresses the importance of abidance to the time-line and procedures in paragraph 26 of the draft resolution. To achieve this, we should respect and utilize compilation of proposals on NLBI to be prepared and circulated by UNFF Secretariat as a basis for further discussions and make sure that a draft text of NLBI will be available before UNFF7. REPUBLIC OF KOREA Comments on the proposals made by members on the Non legally Binding Instrument (NLBI) Korea Forest Service, on behalf of the Republic of Korea, would like to express comments on the proposals on NLBI made by members as follows: Recognizing the importance of these Global Objectives, we believe that basically all indicative elements in the Voluntary Instrument should be developed based on the Global Objectives which are set at the UNFF-6. Most of the proposals seem to be rather too broad for purposes of implementing the Global Objectives, which might cause each member to have different expectations. Thus these proposals should be further clarified. Means of Implementation are crucial to achieving the Global Objectives. We agree with the basic ideas regarding securing high-level political commitment, facilitating a better exchange of experience and good practice and promoting the transfer of technology to and capacity building especially in developing countries. However many proposals suggested broad means of implementation, especially for financial mechanisms, which do not seem practically applicable and in some ways overlap with one another. So these proposals should be fully discussed among members at the 7th session in order to draw internationally harmonized simple financial mechanisms to enhance effectiveness with respect to mobilization and utilization. With respect to Working Modalities, even though specific MYPOW will be adopted at UNFF-7, the Modalities should be developed clearly and separately at all levels in a transparent and open-ended manner that allows all stakeholders to participate in the decision making process. We would also like to propose to strengthen collaboration among relevant regional organizations such as FAO regional office in order to effectively implement the Objectives, taking into account the special circumstances of the region and the common but differentiated responsibilities of countries. And we emphasize that a specific time-bound schedule should be considered for not only achieving the Objectives but also conducting periodic Monitoring, Assessment and Reporting (MAR) of the implementation of the Objectives. Time-limited implementation of the Objectives and MAR should be performed on an incentive basis such as financial supports for the purpose of achieving the Objectives within the limited period. Policies and measures should be developed clearly and separately at all levels, including the international, regional and national level. A country's commitments should be clearly identified based on the categories into which countries shall be classified by proportion of forest cover and loss during the last 10 years. Each category and their commitments shall be decided at UNFF-7. We already set Global Objectives, deciding to go along with non-legally binding instrument (NLBI) on the management, conservation and sustainable development of all type of forests at UNFF-6. However, we need concrete ideas for the specific indicative elements of the Voluntary Instrument and ways of achieving the Global Objectives. And we are worried about how well the NLBI will function for SFM and we still have difficulty in understanding what our national commitment might be under the NLBI. In order to reach common understanding of the Voluntary Instrument, specific modalities for all levels that can be implemented within a limited timetable should be presented. PAKISTAN Pakistan's Proposal on Non Legally Binding Instrument Preamble & Purpose Recognizing global, national, and local importance of forests Admitting sovereignty of nations on their forest resources Emphasizing synergies between forestry aspects of different multilateral environmental agreements including Convention on Biological Diversity, UN Convention to Combat Desertification and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (and Kyoto Protocol) Recalling all international forestry initiatives, programmes, dialogues, and actions Noting that rate of deforestation has not been slowed down despite local, national and international efforts Reminding the root causes of deforestation in global contexts including natural and anthropogenic causes Justifying the need for an international instrument as a collaborative measure towards conservation, protection, development and sustainable use of forest resources Adoption / Endorsement As per UN system Principles and Definitions Achieving global objectives through national and local actions with international support Involving forest owners, right holders, custodian and forest dependent communities and other stakeholders in local planning, actions and monitoring of SFM Promoting a system of incentives, and pay-for-environmental services (PES) to compensate in lieu of cessation of legal rights of use of forest resources Invoking private-public partnership at all levels of management, both on obligatory and benefitsharing basis Integrating forest accounting and green accounting in national and global economies, giving due economic values to all direct and indirect benefits of forests and their contribution in GDP "All Types of Forests" need to be elaborated in terms of: State-owned vs. Communal / private forests Natural vs. Man-made forests Commercial vs. Protective forests Extensive vs. Relict forests Objectives of NLBI NLBI seeks to promote SFM towards achievement of four agreed global goals. Simultaneously, implementation of NLBI will tend to achieve objectives of forestry components of other MEAs including CBD's Expanded Programme of Work on Forests. Streamlining with National Policies and Development Planning NLBI acknowledging the contribution of FAO and National Forestry Programme (NFP) Facility in initiating in-country dialogue on forest policy among all stakeholders, encourages inter-country and regional dialogue on forest policy Member countries to valuate direct and indirect benefits of all types of forests, estimate real contribution of forests in other sectors' earnings including water, agriculture, tourism sectors and adequately reflect economic values of forests in national development planning Forestry to be integrated in Poverty Reduction Strategies and Social development programmes of member countries Forest Utilization Member countries to conduct detailed evaluation of their respective demands and supplies of wood and wood products and make strategies for meeting demands and ensuring sustainable utilization of forests Member countries to take necessary measures to relieve natural forests from being exploited for low-value uses such as fuel-wood.

Asian Development Bank, The World Bank and other international and bilateral financial institutions to be requested to allocate CDM funds for Afforestation/Reforestation projects Clearinghouse Mechanism Member countries will disseminate information on forestry situation, policies, programmes and projects in forestry sector, and all other relevant data and information for general public and international communities through establishing CHM Neighboring countries or regional countries may join together to establish CHM Awareness, Education, Research & Development Member countries to make potential use of print and electronic media to run problem-oriented and need-based mass awareness campaigns on forestry. Primary, secondary and tertiary curricula to include Forestry as major or minor subject depending upon the needs. National R&D institutions to promote applied research in the fields of tree improvements, forest protection (pathology), watershed management, wood products, and forest ecosystems and forest biodiversity. Member countries will undertake collaborative R&D with potential technical and financial support from developed countries in the fields of forest taxonomy, carbon sequestration potential, forest hydrologic process simulation, impact assessment of climate change and pollutants on forest health and growth, non-timber forest products, feasibility of inter-country wood trades, ecotourism, regeneration techniques for Riverine, linear, dryland/desert, mangrove, and relict forests, economic valuation of forest biodiversity resources etc. Inventories, Forest Resource Assessment & Monitoring Periodic Forest assessment, monitoring and reporting is the sole responsibility of member countries. However, they may adopt a standard "Forest Resource Assessment & Monitoring" framework containing methodology, frequency etc. for forest surveys and monitoring, for mutual comparisons and collation Capacity Building and Technology Transfer All member countries to prepare a matrix of available knowledge, technologies and capacities to implement SFM and conduct gap analysis and report in national communication. UNFF/ECOSOC to facilitate interaction of donor and recipient member countries. Technical and financial assistances and transfer of technology by developed countries will be counted towards meeting of their obligations under NLBI to achieve the global objectives Formulation of Non-Legally Binding Instrument on Forests Pakistan's Comments on the Compilation of Proposals on NLBI The proposals of South Africa, Indonesia and to some extent Brazil also, in the area of means of implementation are more or less similar to Pakistan proposal. All of these proposals focus on: capacity building, transfer of technology, clearing house mechanisms, public private partnerships and increased international of resources for GEF and forest related funds. In response to Brazil proposal, Pakistan considers that bringing SFM in domain of GEF will not be feasible since GAF is mandated to implement three Rio tv1EAs. Instead, Pakistan has suggested a separate and independent financial mechanism to cater for needs of developing county parties seeking to implement four global objectives through NLBI. Brazil seeks to classify forests into protective and managed forests, which is very broad division. Pakistan has suggested more concrete and precise classification of forests because objectives of their management are very different. Canada has proposed keeping a percentage of land area under forest cover. To be very precise, we can mention 1'vIDG targets fixed by the countries to be achieved by 2015. The proposal for compliance regime and dispute settlement is a good proposal, but it should be essentially a nondiscriminatory and justice-making body, as many developing countries anticipate such an international regime might harm their interests. European Union has asked for a process of facilitation, peer review and dialogue. Pakistan will favor it provided balanced representation of regions/ common interest groups. US has proposed safeguarding legally harvested forests, while Australia, Indonesia and Youth Group seek to discourage trade of illegal harvesting. Both are complimentary, but the real issue is to decide the legal status of harvesting. What is legal in national legislation may not be legal in international scenario. Pakistan considers that a clear indication of legal and illegal harvesting be given in NLBI. The most practicable approach may be for the Parties to report on existing forest resources, annual growth rate, and extractable volumes (with species) in line with practices of SFM. Anything in excess of reported volumes and species may be treated as "Illegal" and should not be traded. South Africa stands with Pakistan in proposing closer linkages of NLBI with other international environmental agreements including CBD, UNCCD and UNFCCC that will certainly enhance ODA mainly from GEF sources. Pakistan supports Woman Group asking for including a clause in NLBI on gender mainstreaming in SFM None of the proposals has addressed the most important and key issue concerning forest protection, management and development, which is the legal ownership and tenural systems of forestlands. Pakistan's proposal asks for legal description for different legal categories of forests before suggesting measures and actions under NLBI. SOUTH AFRICA POSSIBLE ELEMENTS OF A NON-LEGALLY BINDING INSTRUMENT (NLBI) The following are proposed elements for a non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests: Objectives, Principles and Definitions: The NBLI should be based on existing principles which will guide its operations. The Rio Forests Principles should form the basis for the principles to be developed. Of especial importance would be the need to emphasize the sovereign rights of countries regarding the usage of their own resources and the importance of their own environmental policies, as well as the common, but differentiated responsibilities of countries to the conservation of the global environment The importance of forests as contained in Agenda 21 should also be emphasized The three pillars of SFM, social, economic and environmental should be emphasized The "instrument" should also draw on the recommendations emanating on the international forestry debates post-Rio, specifically the IPF / IFF process and the current UNFF arrangement. Mention should be made of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation The role of the United Nations Forum on Forests and decisions adopted by the Forum, actions identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests and the Intergovernmental forum on forests The need to strengthen the International Arrangement on Forests should be emphasized High level commitments by Governments to promote the implementation of Sustainable Forest Management should be emphasized ECOSOC resolution 2000/35, the roadmap to Sustainable Forest Management, the global objectives of forests, highlighting the importance of promoting SFM, curbing deforestation and enhancing the contribution of forests towards the achievement of international development goals should be reaffirmed Obligations for Parties: There is a need to spell out clearly defined obligations or commitments for all parties. We believe that the obligations could creatively be divided between categories of actors e.g. countries could be described as developed, in transition and developing; organs e.g. national and international; etc and the obligation levels for the various categories can be differentiated within the categories. Possible obligations which could be described : Development of national forest programmes/national action plans which would show their commitments. The criteria for preparing these programmes, the funding sources to assist their development, a suggested format could be contained. Reporting on measures taken to implement the decisions and effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the instrument; Institutional Arrangements: This needs to be clearly spelt out. The UNFF should be the body to whom reporting is done. The UNFF Secretariat should continue to assist the process. Furthermore, the "instrument" should clearly define: The format for reporting progress, which should be voluntary Adoption procedures, as well as, amendments to the "instrument" or protocols (under the instrument); ratification, acceptance and approval; etc. The manner and form in which the review envisaged to take place in 2015 will be conducted Linkages with other international forest-related processes, such as the UNCBD, UNCCD, Climate Change, etc. Means of Implementation: The instrument should also address (or provide for) the following issues related to means of implementation: Capacity building Innovative funding mechanisms The creation of a Forest Development Fund/Global Forest Fund Increased accessibility by developing countries and countries with economies in transition to international financial resources The creation of an enabling environment for investment in forests The creation of mechanisms in terms of which new smaller land owners or users are enabled to survive in the sector, especially in developing countries where the forest sector has been largely corporate and the economic empowerment needs to be from a broader population; Access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies Stimulation of synergies with other multilateral agreements The promotion of SFM nationally, sub-regionally, regionally and continentally Recognition is given to the special needs of Low Forest Cover Countries and developing countries in general Recognition is given to the special needs of countries with fragile ecosystems An instrument which acknowledges and seeks to address the position of communities who derive benefits from forests, especially those living adjacent to forests The promotion and strengthening of partnerships to ensure SFM is achieved, including those with the private sector and other major groups The promotion of co-operation sub-regionally, regionally and continentally Mechanisms for the provision of financial resources; International co-operation and assistance. Should take into account regional needs and specificities Establish a Plan of Action/Work Programme for periods of years (either three or five year periods) which will address the goals set at UNFF 6 and ensure that SWITZERLAND Non-legally binding instrument on sustainable management of all types of forests Function of the instrument: "Implement sustainable forest management all over the world" NB: An instrument is only useful if it has an added value Purpose: Increase the visibility of forests Strengthen political commitments towards sustainable forest management and improve the framework for sfm across sectors By providing guidance and reference points, II improve implementation of sustainable forest management for all types of forests worldwide Short Preamble, including explanation of context and relationship to other existing instruments,) Principles (NB: should be included in preambule if refers to already agreed principles. If new principles: stay as a separate "3. Principles") Rio principles, forest principles, Chapter 11/Agenda 21... Definitions Sustainable forest management, environmental services, illegal logging, sector governance, tenure and use rights, access benefit sharing, certification, all types of forests, ... Global Objectives on forests (that should include targets and indicators for their implementation: ex: percentage of forest increase by 2010 such as in the MDGs: National policies and measures Countries should take the following national policies and measures: Develop quantified national targets in relation to the global strategic objectives Include forests in PRSPs and sustainable development strategies Maintain a national forest estate as a percentage of total area Establish forest sector governance clarify, establish and implement secure use/tenure rights promote the development and use of voluntary codes by forest managers and industry, going beyond national legislation implement transparent forest concession allocation systems take measures to assess and control illegal logging Address trade associated with illegal logging Initiate, complete, review and/or update forest inventories Develop national frameworks of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management Develop and implement national forest programs, forest management plans through an integrated, coordinated implementation with other policies and sectors (e.g. water, biodiversity, energy) Integrate traditional forest-related knowledge into forest management Safeguard forests as appropriate from fire, insects, diseases, pollution, alien species, degradation and potential effects of genetically modified organisms Require environmental impact assessments for projects with potential adverse effects Support the development of certification schemes Promote research, capacity building, education, information and public awareness Promote and implement schemes of payments for forest-related environmental services Promote access benefit sharing If reporting or peer reviews reveal and assess what steps are to be taken in a country (institution building, capacity building, decentralisation, cross-sectoral institutional reform, land-use planning) in order to improve the management/protection of forests it is easier to allocate funding financial arrangements; capacity building; technology transfers National modalities for cooperation Cross-sectoral coordination and cooperation for national implementation as well as ensure coherent national position in international fora Education, research and development Public information and awareness raising Involvement of major groups and relevant stakeholders, Involvement of the private sector (Public Private Partnerships-PPPs) International modalities for cooperation Peer reviews Institutional modalities: Mechanism to review future effectiveness of the instrument The countries commit themselves to report on the implementation of the instrument UNFF is the recipient of the countries reports and responsible for the overall analysis The effectiveness of the instrument will be reviewed in 2015 Adoption / Endorsement/institutional arrangement Adoption by UNFF to ensure a universal membership Swiss comments on the last round of proposals on the content of the nonlegally binding instrument on all types of forests under the United Nations Forum on Forests The non legally binding instrument (nlbi) should not be a weaker copy and paste of the ECOSOC resolution or a duplication of the 1992 forest principles. It should not be a nearly identical document, with the scope of replacing the resolution. The nlbi should be a part of the international arrangement on forests and therefore strengthen it. If it is necessary for the nlbi to take into account what was done before and be in full coherence with other instruments related to forests, it should build on and reflect the rich body of IPF and IFF proposals for action, but it should go further than what is already on the table, i.e. have an added value. The scope of a nlbi should be a more effective implementation of sfm and therefore should help secure high level commitment for sfm A nlbi should have concrete commitments and not a mere promotion of some actions The nlbi should not involve new meetings. Any reporting should be occur during regular UNFF meetings The nlbi should not have its own multiyear programme of work as a the MYPOW is already going to be adopted at UNFF7 The UNFF secretariat should administrate the nlbi The nlbi can refer to the different state of the countries but we should not have a division of commitments between different categories of countries: the dispositions of this nlbi should be valid for all It should not be a mere list of possible commitments from which each country can pick and chose its own priorities, but establish clear common programmatic priorities able to provide guidance for national and international forest policy. Some issues are important and came out of the last round of countries and major groups'comments, such as reporting, regional cooperation, forest restoration, illegal logging and associated trade, environmental impact assessment in forest management plans, public-private partnerships, certification, promotion of non timber products, direct and indirect values of forests versus other sectors, innovative financing mechanisms such as payments for ecosystem services, integration of forest in the accounting and green accounting in national and global economies and their contribution to GDP, transboundary dimension, definition of pertinent terms, UNITED STATES US Submission on a Non-Legally Binding Instrument on Forests INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING ON SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT (CODEX SYLVANUS) The Subscribing States/Member States of the United Nations General Assembly, Recalling ECOSOC resolution [2006/# of day and month] on the Outcome of the sixth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests and resolution 2000/35 of 18 October 2000 on the Report of the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests, which, inter alia, decided the main objective and functions of the international arrangement on forests, established the UNFF, and invited the executive heads of relevant organizations, institutions and instruments to form a CPF to support the work of the Forum and to enhance cooperation and coordination among participants;

ZIMBABWE Summary of Submission by Zimbabwe Because of its length (43 pages) and the related cost of translation, the submission by Zimbabwe has been summarized in this paper. The full text of the initial submission is available on the website of the United Nations Forum on Forests. The proposal provided by Zimbabwe relates more closely to its proposal for a national Forestry Code. However, it contains a number of elements pertinent to the work of the United Nations Forum on Forests that are relevant to the development of a non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests. Zimbabwe's proposed Forestry Code bases itself on the outcomes of the International Forest Policy Dialogue undertaken by the Forum. It highlights the importance that the Dialogue has had in the development of national forest programmes or their equivalent. Key elements for Zimbabwe that emanate from the work of the UNFF, which are reflected in its work at the national level and which are relevant to a non-legally binding instrument include: The Global Objectives on Forests agreed to at the sixth session of the UNFF; The IPF/IFF proposals for action as building blocks for addressing national forestry priorities and strengthening national forest programmes; Streamlining the IPF/IFF proposals for action to facilitate their implementation at the national level; Stakeholder participation in national forest programmes; The promotion of cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary collaboration; Raising public awareness of IPF/IFF and UNFF processes and outcomes; Promoting capacity-building in developing countries; Inadequate financial resources for implementing sustainable forest management; Monitoring and assessment of forest resources; Substantive areas of particular importance: extent of forest resources; forest biological diversity; forest health and vitality; productive and protective functions of forests; socio-economic functions of forests; and policy, legal and institutional framework; and Forestry Research ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS ASEAN Input Paper: Indicative Elements and Proposals for the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests I. Background The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) proposes that the indicative elements and proposals for the non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests should be premised on the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (Rio Declaration), the Non-legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests (Forest Principles), Chapter 11 - Combating Deforestation under Agenda 21, the decisions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF), the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF), and the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), as well as the Monterrey Consensus and forest and forest-related matters deliberated by other multilateral environmental agreements. More specifically, the non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests should `promote international cooperation on forest management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests, including afforestation, reforestation and rehabilitation' as reflected in paragraph 11.12 (e) of Chapter 11 - Combating Deforestation under Agenda 21. The non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests should also incorporate the four global objectives as negotiated and agreed during the Sixth Session of the UNFF held in New York, U.S.A. from 13 to 24 February, 2006, while taking into account relevant progress indicators of the MDGs, namely: `Global Objective 1: Reverse the loss of forest cover worldwide through sustainable forest management, including protection, restoration, afforestation and reforestation, and increase efforts to prevent forest degradation'; `Global Objective 2: Enhance forest-based economic, social and environmental benefits including by improving the livelihood of forest dependent people'; `Global Objective 3: Increase significantly the area of protected forests worldwide and other areas of sustainably managed forests, and increase the proportion of forest products from sustainably managed forests'; and `Global Objective 4: Reverse the decline in official development assistance for sustainable forest management and mobilize significantly increased new and additional financial resources from all sources for the implementation of sustainable forest management'. Furthermore, ASEAN envisages that the non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests would: provide an over-arching strategy to fully integrate forest conservation, development and sustainable management into policy-making at the local, national, regional and international levels; allow forest issues that are so distinct and varied to be addressed in a holistic, integrated and comprehensive manner that would transcend the confines of existing instruments and would integrate the conservation of forests and their biological diversity, the socio-economic importance of forests to nations, the effects of international trade and the cultural and spiritual values of forests; create synergy among existing multilateral environmental agreements dealing with forest and forest-related matters, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and increase in efficiency of efforts and resource used; provide a balanced environment in which mutually supportive environmental and economic interests co-exist and a platform to address more effectively the underlying causes of global deforestation and forest degradation, especially those relating to transboundary causes, such as consumption patterns and investment; provide a more predictable environment that will attract the much needed private sector investment for sustainable forest management; bring about new and additional financial resources through a dedicated global forest fund, and the transfer of environmentally sound technology to enable countries, especially developing countries, to achieve sustainable forest management; increase the level of exchange of scientific, economic and social information and provide a strategic framework for global forest research and networking; promote a mutually supportive relationship between trade and environment that further facilitates international trade of forest products from sustainably managed and legally harvested forests; encourage integrated and holistic policy-making at the national level, involving all actors, so as to achieve forest conservation, and sustainable forest management and development; and intensify and further raise the political and public profile of forests at both the national and international levels, as well as accord higher priority and support to conserve, protect and sustainably manage the world's forests. II. INDICATIVE ELEMENTS The list of indicative elements proposed by ASEAN for inclusion in the non-legally binding instrument on all types of forests should be categorized into seven broad classes which are similar to the 16 elements in the UNFF's Plan of Action that were suggested to be used to cluster the 270 IPF/IFF Proposals for Action for implementation by countries, and should include the following (not in order of priority): Forest Management and Development security of natural forests and forest plantations, including forest management and forest land use plan, in relation to national goals and targets which is based on land use planning; national forest programmes based on a holistic and inter-sectoral approach in formulation and which is consistent with the country's sustainable development strategies and involving all major groups; forest plantations establishment and development to supplement global wood supply and relieve pressure to natural forests; forest cover and forest productivity is increased in ecologically, economically and socially sound ways through rehabilitation, reforestation and afforestation, including on unproductive, degraded and deforested lands; fuelwood for cooking, heating and other sources of energy is sourced from sustainably managed forest, including through reforestation and afforestation activities; and perennial agriculture crops as sustainable and environmentally sound sources of renewable lignocellulosic materials, and food and energy, including the practice of agro-forestry. Forest Conservation and Protection protected areas of ecologically viable representatives of unique forest types of national and global importance; forest diversity at genetic, species, ecosystem and landscape levels is conserved and enhanced; endangered, rare and threatened forest species are protected; health and vitality of forest resources, including the ecological, hydrological and carbon cycles at national, regional and global levels; soil productivity and watershed protection; soil acidification and forest loss due to airborne pollutants, especially transboundary pollutants; measures in management and contingency plans developed to address threats of serious harm to forests, such as fires, pest and diseases, natural disasters, etc.; equitable sharing of financial burden in the conservation and protection of forest biological diversity that is of global importance, including financial compensation to offset opportunity cost foregone in forest conservation, and to countries which allocate more than their fair share in forest land for the benefit of the world's community; and forest law enforcement and governance. Traditional Forest-related Knowledge access to forest genetic resources is based on prior informed consent and on equitable and mutually agreed terms, as well as protection from illegal transfer of such resources; regime for protecting traditional forest-related knowledge and the application of intellectual property rights, including giving due recognition to the use of traditional forest-related knowledge in patent applications for technologies; access to traditional forest-related knowledge and the fair and equitable sharing of its benefits, including payment of compensation to local and indigenous communities for the use of traditional forest related knowledge and technologies developed by them; and involvement of relevant stakeholders, including indigenous people, forest-dwellers and local communities, in decision-making and management of forests.

MAJOR GROUP: CHILDREN AND YOUTH Background These proposals are highlighted priorities of MG Children/Youth identified during UNFF3, UNFF4, UNFF5 and UNFF6 that need to be included in NLBI. They are based on the principle of intergenerational justice, which demands decision-makers to face the responsibility to pass on a sound environment to the future generations; to give them the education they need to protect it and to allow them to grow up without poverty caused by the unsustainable use and management of forests resources. Erosion of local control of resources threatens the social fabric of forest dependent communities, of which youth are an integral part. We are concerned that inadequate protection and recognition of traditional forest-related knowledge will interfere with this invaluable resource being transferred to future generations. Education and capacity building Education on forests has multiple effects to the development of young people as responsible citizens. This is the key to raising awareness among Children about the necessity of the sustainable use of forests and to provide basic knowledge of forest ecosystems. [...] Access to education is often limited in developing countries, where many young people are not even able to attain a basic education. Yet even in wealthy countries, education concerning forest conservation is not always included in standard school curricula. This needs to be addressed, starting at the primary level, if students are to be aware of the value and benefits of forests. (UNFF4) Member states are encouraged to set standards of professional forestry education by synchronizing the quality of the forestry education. A strategy for filling the gaps in forestry curricula should be formulated in cooperation with other member states. Resolution 4/4, 9. [...] In order to ensure sustainable forest management across generations and to increase understanding of forests as a critical resource, a greater emphasis needs to be placed on education through the integration of social and cultural aspects of forests in kindergarten, school and university curricula. (UNFF4); Member states should support informal forest education throughout the work of youth organizations. Young people are often highly motivated to contribute to the development of society, having fresh ideas and innovative approaches. Youth as a group can effectively contribute to the implementation of sustainable development including SFM. Education is the key to making wise decisions about the future of the world's forests, as it is central to enabling children and youth to understand and communicate the link between using up resources today and the need to access them in the future in order to sustain their livelihoods. In order to achieve a re-emphasis of education, new criteria have to be defined to assess the extent to which educational aspects have been integrated into national forest and development programmes so far. Economic and social aspects Young people feel the need to enforce the laws in national and international level in order to combat illegal loggings, especially in developing countries to reduce poverty. As already stated in the Children/Youth Discussion Paper for UNFF4 Timber cut in developing regions or in countries with large intact primary forests is often shipped away to be processed - often illegally-, with very little employment generated for local communities, especially for youth. Resolution 3/1 3. Calls upon countries to take immediate action on domestic forest law enforcement and illegal international trade in forest products, including in forest biological resources, with the support of the international community, and provide human and institutional capacity-building related to the enforcement of national legislation in those areas; Resolution 4/2 7. Urges countries, in accordance with their national legislation, to foster greater involvement and effective participation of their relevant stakeholders, including indigenous and local communities, particularly women and youth, in the development, decision-making, implementation and practice of sustainable forest management; Resolution 4/2 2. Urges countries, within their priorities and capacities, to integrate sustainable forest management into their overall national poverty eradication and development strategies, including through their national forest programmes and processes or their equivalent, consistent with their international obligations. We regard the promotion of enhanced cooperation across sectors as a key element to effective stakeholder participation and seek to foster the involvement of teaching and research institutions in decision-making processes. MAJOR GROUP: WOMEN Proposal for the NLBI from Major Group WOMEN In response to the Non Legally Binding Instrument agreed to by member nations, and in support of the Four Global Objectives on Forests, the Major Group WOMEN would like to reiterate that these goals and objectives cannot be met without women's active engagement and leadership. As a group, women are an integral part of implementation and their participation in the process is required to ensure ownership of the outcomes and effective action; women leaders have an important role to play in creating focused priorities for future action. To date, the Major Group WOMEN has been successful at ensuring that the experiences and concerns of women have been voiced and tabled in the UNFF formal sessions and expert meetings to raise awareness on the barriers faced by women foresters, forestry students and community members, and to describe successful initiatives that have achieved SFM and women's empowerment. These have all pointed to the need for structural changes within forestry organizations to address gender equality. But within the UNFF process, we have yet to see more than a very few explicit statements of support for and commitment to women and gender equality in relation to Sustainable Forest Management and the International Arrangement on Forests. Despite the efforts of the Major Group WOMEN over the past few years to draw attention to these concerns within the UNFF sessions and inter-sessional meetings, and the commonly heard references to poverty and the MDGs, women have not been recognized as an integral part of the deliberations. This next phase, of the NLBI, now requires that more significant attention and resources be devoted to gender issues and women's needs and contributions related to SFM, poverty alleviation and related topics such as those of health so that such changes can be implemented. Towards this goal, Major Group WOMEN offers cooperation, skills, knowledge and networks of women throughout the world to forge new paths by engaging women as equal partners in sustainable forest management. In order to promote the adoption of action oriented policy decisions for the NLBI through 2015, the Major Group WOMEN hereby proposes events and activities as priority areas for action. Research for change: A recent meeting of women forestry professionals in Sweden, sponsored by the IUFRO Working Group on Gender and Forestry Research, endorsed a plan to assist FAO to extend the research already completed by FAO on gender and forestry in Europe and North America to other regions, including Anglophone and Francophone Africa and Asia. This group has proposed a project that aims to analyze current knowledge and information gaps regarding gender roles, responsibilities, access and control over resources, challenges and opportunities among selected communities and professional organizations in Asian and African tropical forests; propose actions that promote gender sensitive development among selected communities; and document "best practices" or successful cases of promoting gender sensitive programs in forestry. In relation to the forestry profession, the study will also document the current knowledge and information gaps of gender representation in forestry institutions in selected Asian and African countries; analyse key challenges to the present status; recommend actions for improving gender balance; and disseminate information. The Major Group WOMEN will collaborate with these organizations and individuals to engage its network of women forestry professionals, and bring research results to the attention of UNFF member states at a formal session or informal side event sometime in 2007. Enhancing collaboration and partnership between government and civil society to mainstream gender in forestry, Nepal Nepal has achieved certain exemplary performances in project implementation through the effective collaboration between NGOs and government agencies to achieve maximum participation of women and other deprived groups of forest users in national forestry development programs. The Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation (MFSC) collaborated with a national NGO specializing on gender and forestry development, to bridge the gender gap by training and mentoring rural and professional women as group promoters and gender focal persons from livestock and forestry departments. This has led to a policy shift whereas MFSC developed a national strategy for gender mainstreaming action plans until 2015. As an activity of the Major Group WOMEN, WOCAN proposes to build on this unique effort and to strengthen linkages with the MFSC of Nepal by establishing a formal relationship for at least the next 3 years, to assess the effectiveness of NGO/ government partnership strategy; identify gaps in MFSC's efforts in gender mainstreaming in programs and organizational aspects; and make recommendations. The outcome of this partnership will be a multimedia presentation that highlights the added value of gender mainstreaming to the SFM work of government forestry and related sector agencies. This will be presented at a UNFF session, and distributed to UNFF member states in the form of a CD Rom. Similar partnerships between Major Group WOMEN and the governments of South Africa and the Philippines are under discussion. Regional Meetings of the UNFF Major Group WOMEN will coordinate various side events and meetings in conjunction with the regional meetings of the UNFF, in collaboration with regional organizations working on gender and forestry issues, such as CIFOR, IUFRO, WOCAN partners and others. World Forestry Congress The Major Group WOMEN and the IUFRO Working Group on Gender and Forestry Research have proposed to the FAO organizers the themes of "Gender and Forests" or "Women, Men and Forest Livelihoods" for the XIII World Forestry Congress to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2009. Major Group WOMEN will assure the maximum participation of women at this event. Women in SFM at CSD Women in SFM at CSD 2012/2013 The Commission on Sustainable Development reviews forest management and biodiversity in 2012 and 2013, including aspects of poverty eradication and gender equality. Major Group WOMEN will initiate planning for this significant global event in 2010 to assure maximum participation and impact by women. Issues for WOMEN in SFM: capacity building for women's leadership is required at all levels at the community and professional levels. multi-sectoral approaches are necessary to meet women's needs gender mainstreaming skills and expertise are lacking within all forest related institutions, including universities, international organizations, national forest departments and ministries. pilot projects and case studies are still needed to document the positive impacts of engaging women in poverty-addressing SFM initiatives. resources are needed to strengthen women's capacity-building initiatives. These programs are currently handicapped by grossly inadequate resources. a Gender Advisory Committee composed of women leaders who meet to discuss key issues and propose concrete ways to plan and implement actions at the national and regional levels through collaboration with each other, members of other Major Groups, government representatives and inter-governmental organizations should be formed. With expertise in forestry and gender and development, this group should provide tools, guidelines, technical assistance and training to develop the policies, skills and knowledge for gender mainstreaming within forest related agencies. to assure that policy directives are implemented, the Secretariat's budget should have allocations specifically dealing with gender equality and women's participation. partnerships between governments and civil society, and with regional and global organizations specialized in gender mainstreaming need to be developed so as to assure the implementation of gender sensitive SFM initiatives.
