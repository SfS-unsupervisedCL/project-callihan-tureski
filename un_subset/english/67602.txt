The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth session from 21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Botswana was held at the 5th meeting on 23 January 2013. The delegation of Botswana was headed by Dikgakgamatso Ramadeluka Seretse. At its 10th meeting, held on 25 January 2013, the Working Group adopted the report on Botswana. 2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Botswana: Austria, Poland and Uganda. 3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Botswana: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/BWA/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/BWA/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/BWA/3). 4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Botswana through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review 5. The delegation stated that it was happy to see that the UPR had retained its form, following the review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council. The successful completion of the first cycle of the UPR epitomized the achievement of the Human Rights Council in discharging its mandate. 6. The delegation stated that the value of the UPR depended on the acceptance by Member States that the promotion and protection of human rights could no longer be a side issue in the global discourse of human development. 7. In introducing the national report, the delegation emphasized that the report was a product of broad consultations involving Government, civil society and non-governmental organizations. 8. The delegation stated that Botswana continued to live up to its obligations as a democracy, particularly as it observed the rule of law, fundamental freedoms and good governance characterized by consultations and inclusiveness, as well as due regard for the will of its people. 9. In addition, the delegation stated that the Government placed a high premium on providing resources for the institutions that dealt with the promotion and protection of human rights, including the Office of the Ombudsman, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, the Police Service, the Prisons Service, and the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime. 10. The delegation stated that, in order to protect and safeguard the interests of the people from possible police misconduct, such as torture, corruption and other forms of malpractice, a motion had been adopted in 2011 towards the creation of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. 11. Furthermore, in 2009, a woman had been elected head of the legislature. That election was in addition to key appointments of women to positions of leadership, which included that of the Governor of the Central Bank of Botswana, the Attorney General and the Ombudsman. In the public service sector, female leadership stood at over 40 per cent. 12. With regard to access to justice, the delegation stated that more specialized courts had been established. The initiative had been further augmented by the extension of the Judicial Case Management System from the High Court to lower courts with a view to improving case management and facilitating speedy resolution. In addition, the Government introduced a pilot project on legal aid in 2011, to promote greater access to justice for needy citizens. 13. The delegation stated that the Government continued to pay particular attention to the rights of women, children and youth. Public education on HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence and gender-sensitization initiatives had been adopted. 14. In 2009, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) had been domesticated through the enactment of the new Children's Act, incorporating the Bill of Child Rights. 15. A comprehensive six-year (2010-2016) National Action Plan for Orphans and Vulnerable Children had been adopted to facilitate the welfare and protection of vulnerable children. 16. The delegation stated that the Government had made those strides despite its small and vulnerable economy. 17. The delegation underscored the country's need for assistance and support. Most urgently, Botswana required support for the development of a comprehensive strategy and plan of action on human rights, and was willing to engage with local and international partners in that regard. 18. The delegation stated that the Government had not made any changes to the clemency procedure since 2008, since the procedure was considered sufficiently transparent so as not to warrant any review. 19. The delegation indicated that there was no legislation specifically addressing marital rape. That was a sensitive matter that hinged on established cultural beliefs. Wide consultations with the public and legislators were ongoing. 20. Furthermore, the delegation stated that the Government had put in place a comprehensive public education and awareness programme to disseminate information on the Domestic Violence Act. The Government was at an advanced stage of developing regulations to the Domestic Violence Act to improve implementation. 21. The delegation reported that a number of initiatives were also being developed, including the establishment of the Gender-Based Violence Referral System, which was aimed primarily at promoting closer collaboration among key service providers for survivors and perpetrators. The Government was currently validating the 2012 Gender-Based Violence Indicators Study, which was due for completion in September 2013. 22. The delegation indicated that the National Gender Machinery continued to work with the Botswana Police Service to train police officers on gender-based violence issues. Also, the Government had continued to support civil society organizations that provided services to women and children who were victims of gender-based violence. That support included funding specific activities. 23. The delegation stated that an interministerial initiative was in place to address gender-based violence from a criminal justice perspective, to augment all other existing initiatives and programmes. 24. The delegation stated that the Government had not taken any additional measures, subsequent to the 2010 Employment Act amendment, regarding the issue of sexual orientation. However, the delegation clarified that the Penal Code still proscribed unnatural acts involving persons who have carnal knowledge of others against the order of nature. 25. The delegation stated that the Government continued to engage the Basarwa through established structures, with a view to ensuring a sustainable solution to the Central Kgalagadi Game Reserve (CKGR) matter. Several programmes were being implemented, including poverty eradication, affirmative action, education for all, community-based natural resource management planning, and effective utilization of wildlife management areas. 26. The delegation stated that the Government was working with the coalition of non-governmental organizations that was producing a community-based land use management plan for within the CKGR, intended to address government policies for the conservation of the CKGR biodiversity and wildlife resources. 27. Regarding measures to speed up responses by government departments to the requests of the Office of the Ombudsman, the delegation stated that all departments had been urged to respond promptly to enquiries by the Office. Non-compliance may affect the grading of a given ministry or department during periodic ministerial reviews and could result in severe consequences. 28. Regarding steps taken to ensure equal access for women to education and justice, the delegation stated that there were no institutionalized impediments to education for women. 29. On access to justice, the delegation stated that all persons within the territory of Botswana had access to national courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction. The Abolition of the Marital Power Act of 2005 changed the initial position prohibiting women from bringing an action in the courts without their husband's assistance. In addition, the Rules of the High Court recognized women's unlimited access to the High Court and that a spouse could sue and be sued without the assistance of the other. 30. The delegation stated that the Government continued to comply with international standards in the treatment of prisoners. Regarding overcrowding in prisons, the Government had embarked on a study, with the assistance of the Commonwealth Secretariat, to develop alternatives to imprisonment. That was in addition to a number of measures already being implemented, such as remission and extramural provisions already contained in the legislation. 31. Regarding the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, the delegation stated that the Government did not recognize any specific group as more indigenous than others. All groups were considered to be indigenous to the land. However, the delegation indicated that Botswana recognized that not all groups were at the same level of development. The Government introduced preferential strategies to absorb such communities into the mainstream of the country's economy, including through employment and education. The Government was also actively pursuing affirmative action measures for remote area communities in order to promote social inclusion and equal opportunities for meaningful participation in the development process. In that regard, special dispensation was given for the employment of members of those communities in the police and defence forces, and in the civil service in general. 32. The delegation stated that the Economic Diversification Drive Policy, adopted in 2010, was aimed at improving livelihoods and food security at the household level, especially in rural and remote areas. Additionally, the Livestock Management and Infrastructure Development Programme was specifically designed to improve the economic status of Botswana in rural areas. 33. In education, the delegation stated that a number of policies and strategies had been put in place to ensure that women and the girl child were not discriminated against. Students who fell pregnant were no longer required to discontinue their education. 34. Regarding empowerment of persons with disabilities, the delegation stated that the Coordinating Office for People with Disabilities had been established in 2010. The Office designated coordinating structures in all government ministries and departments at national and district levels to address issues relevant to persons with disabilities. The Office also undertook a continuing review of the laws, with the objective of adequately providing for persons with disabilities. It also undertook to develop a strategy to address issues of disability. 35. The delegation noted that there were several obstacles, such as a lack of resources to modify the environment to accommodate people with disabilities, a lack of skilled personnel, and a lack of appropriate training facilities for students with disabilities. 36. Regarding measures to discourage practices that were detrimental to women's rights, the delegation stated that measures such as public awareness and educational campaigns and legislative reform, particularly in relation to the equal right to inheritance by women and men, had been adopted. The Government also took a decision to cascade the campaign to traditional leaders (Dikgosi), with a view to eliminating negative traditional and cultural practices. 37. Regarding a safer environment in prisons and reduction of health risks, the delegation stated that the Government had introduced human rights education in the training curriculum for prison staff. Furthermore, training was provided by health education officers in District Health Management Teams to ensure continuous health education, including on HIV/AIDS, to the prison population. Health education officers also provided education on other public health interventions, including hygiene. Those measures were designed to ensure a safer environment in prisons and reduction of health risks. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 38.
