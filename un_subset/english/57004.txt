Sixty-fifth session Items 143 and 156 (b) Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 and proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions Appropriation for 2009/10 Expenditure for 2009/10 Unencumbered balance for 2009/2010 Appropriation for 2010/11 Projected expenditure 2010/11a Estimated unencumbered balance for 2010/11a Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2011/12 Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2011/12b a Estimates as at 28 February 2011 (see annex I). b See para. 1 below. 1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions recommends approval of the Secretary-General's proposals for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (A/65/756). The Advisory Committee was informed of an additional proposal by the Secretary-General (see para. 30 below), which would entail a reduction of $133,200 to the original proposed budget of $542,785,700 in document A/65/756. Consequently, the overall requirements for UNIFIL for 2011/12 would amount to $542,652,500. The Committee has made observations and recommendations, where appropriate, in the paragraphs below. 2. The general report of the Advisory Committee on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/65/743) contains its views and recommendations on a number of cross-cutting issues. In the present report, the Committee deals with resources and other items that relate specifically to UNIFIL. 3. In considering the Secretary-General's proposals for UNIFIL for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012, the Advisory Committee has taken into account the recommendations of the Board of Auditors related to the Mission (see A/65/5 (Vol. II), chap. II) and has made specific comments thereon in paragraphs 27, 39, 46 and 47 below. In addition, the report of the Advisory Committee on the Board's report on the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the financial period ended 30 June 2010 is contained in document A/65/782. The Committee reiterates the need for the expeditious implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Board of Auditors. 4. The documents reviewed and those used for background by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the financing of UNIFIL are listed at the end of the present report. II. Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 5. In its resolution 63/298, the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $589,799,200 gross ($578,900,800 net) for the maintenance of the mission for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. Expenditures for the period totalled $542,110,800 gross ($530,131,100 net). The resulting unencumbered balance of $47,688,400 represents, in gross terms, 8.1 per cent of the appropriation. An analysis of variances is provided in section IV of the financial performance report for the period from July 2009 to 30 June 2010 (A/65/608 and Corr.1). The Advisory Committee notes that the value of non-budgeted contributions from the host Government amounted to $17,686,500, which relates to land and premises provided to the Mission (A/65/608/Corr.1, sect. III.F). 6. The underexpenditures are mainly attributable to: (a) Military contingents ($29,905,900): reduced requirements for reimbursements for troop costs, contingent-owned equipment and rations, owing mainly to the lower average deployment of 11,911 military contingent personnel, as compared with the planned 12,750; (b) International staff ($1,986,400): reduced requirements for common staff costs, owing to the actual average vacancy rate of 22 per cent as compared with 18 per cent budgeted; (c) Ground transportation ($1,330,200): reduced requirements for the acquisition and rental of vehicles, resulting from non-acquisition of vehicles owing to the rationalization of the composition of the vehicle fleet to reflect changes in operational requirements and from the transfer of three heavy buses from the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo; (d) Naval transportation ($10,964,200): reduced requirements for rental and operation, owing to the deployment of an average of 8 vessels and 1 helicopter for 6 to 7 months in the Maritime Task Force, as compared with 9 vessels and 5 helicopters planned for 12 months; (e) Communications ($1,777,400): reduced requirements for commercial communications, spare parts and contingent-owned equipment, owing to the mission's lower prorated share of the global transponder lease, the acquisition of 24 new jammers and the lower-than-budgeted deployment of military contingent personnel, respectively; (f) Medical ($1,827,200): reduced requirements for reimbursement for self-sustainment, resulting from the early repatriation of a contingent and a contingent-owned level-II hospital that was replaced by the mission's upgraded level-II facility. 7. Underexpenditures were partially offset by increased requirements under: (a) National staff ($1,334,800): additional requirements for salaries as a result of the revision of the salary scales for National Officers and national General Service staff effective 1 September 2009; (b) Facilities and infrastructure ($474,800): additional requirements primarily for petrol, oil and lubricants, owing to the higher unit cost of diesel fuel at $0.60 per litre as compared with the budgeted cost of $0.46 per litre, the acquisition of 1.01 million litres of reserve fuel required as part of a new turnkey contract for which no provision had been made, and increased consumption and higher actual cost of liquefied propane gas to support military personnel. 8. The comments of the Advisory Committee on the information presented in the performance report (A/65/608) on individual objects of expenditure can be found, where relevant, in the discussion of the proposed budget for the period from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2012 (A/65/756) in section IV below. III. Financial position and information on the current period 9. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 28 February 2011, a total of $5,721,233,000 had been assessed on Member States in respect of UNIFIL since its inception. Payments received as at the same date amounted to $5,614,976,000, leaving an outstanding balance of $106,257,000. As at 7 March 2011, the cash position of the Mission was $477,300,000, including the three-month operating reserve of $59,132,000. The remaining cash balance of $418,168,000 is sufficient to allow for reimbursements to troop-contributing countries at the next payment, scheduled for April 2011. 10. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 31 December 2010, an estimated amount of $13,348,000 was owed for troop-cost reimbursements and $34,398,000 for contingent-owned equipment. In respect of death and disability compensation, $21,532,000 had been paid for 503 claims since the inception of the mission, and 1 claim was pending as at 28 February 2011. The Committee expects that the outstanding claim will be settled expeditiously. 11. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 28 February 2011, the incumbency for UNIFIL for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 was as follows: Authorizeda Encumbered Vacancy rate (percentage) Military contingent personnel Posts International staff National staff General temporary assistance International positions a Represents the highest authorized strength for the period. 12. The Advisory Committee was provided with a table showing current and projected expenditures for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011, with reasons for variances (see annex I). As at 28 February 2011, expenditures for the period amounted to $298,734,000. At the end of the current financial period, the estimated total expenditures would amount to $518,639,800 against the appropriation of $518,710,200, leaving a projected unencumbered balance of $70,400. From annex I, the Committee notes that the estimated total expenditures of $518,639,800 include projected overexpenditures in the following areas: (a) International staff ($682,000) and national staff ($4,391,300) owing to lower-than-budgeted vacancy rates; (b) Facilities and infrastructure ($170,900) and ground transportation ($560,300): owing to a higher unit cost for fuel; (c) Naval transportation ($2,041,300) as the result of a change in the fleet composition (which included an additional patrol boat and corvette, partially offset by one less frigate), as well as higher monthly reimbursement costs (see also paras. 38 to 40 below). 13. The Committee also notes from annex I that the above-listed projected overexpenditures would be offset by estimated underexpenditures, including an amount of $6,176,700 under military contingents owing to the delayed deployment of replacement troops. 14. The Advisory Committee was further informed that the total level of projected expenditures for the current period might reach $533.7 million, representing an overexpenditure of $15 million, or 2.89 per cent. Upon request for more information with respect to the potential overexpenditures of $15 million, the Committee was informed that UNIFIL expected funding pressure in a number of areas, such as: (a) higher requirements under civilian personnel as the result of the actual vacancy rates of 18 per cent for international staff and 11 per cent for national General Service staff, compared with the budgeted rates of 22 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively; (b) higher expenditures for fuel; and (c) higher reimbursement costs for the Maritime Task Force. In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes that overexpenditures in these expenditure groups have already been projected and presented in annex I (see para. 12 above). Since a detailed breakdown of the potential overexpenditures of $15 million has not been provided to the Advisory Committee, it is not clear to the Committee how the potential overexpenditures of $15 million relate to the overexpenditures already projected in annex I. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that UNIFIL would continue to manage its budget within its mandate and would endeavour to absorb emerging cost overruns from within approved resources. The Advisory Committee expects that the Mission will make the utmost effort to absorb additional expenditures from within the appropriation for the current financial period. IV. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 A. Mandate and planned results 15. The mandate of UNIFIL was established by the Security Council in its resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978) and expanded in its resolution 1701 (2006), in which the Council authorized an increase in the force strength of UNIFIL to a maximum of 15,000 troops. The most recent extension of the mandate of the Mission, until 31 August 2011, was authorized by the Council in its resolution 1937 (2010). The Mission is mandated to help the Council achieve the overall objective of restoring international peace and security in southern Lebanon (see A/65/756, paras. 1 and 2). 16. In his fifteenth report on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) (S/2011/91), the Secretary-General informed the Council that the situation in the area of operations of UNIFIL remained generally stable and that the cessation of hostilities established in August 2006 between the parties continued to hold. The Secretary-General indicated that the parties had reiterated their commitment to the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), though key obligations of the parties remained to be implemented. According to the Secretary-General, cooperation between UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces remained a cornerstone for the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), while tripartite meetings, chaired by the UNIFIL Force Commander and attended by senior representatives of the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, were an essential forum for regular liaison and coordination and for addressing related security and military operational issues (ibid., paras. 2, 15 and 26). 17. Information on progress with respect to the visible marking of the Blue Line is provided in paragraph 12 of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council. It is indicated that the work continued slowly within the previously agreed five sectors, comprising a total of 38 kilometres, where 87 markers were in place out of an estimated total of 171. The marking process requires the clearance of minefields and the disposal of unexploded ordnance in order to create safe access for measuring the coordinates and constructing the Blue Line markers. UNIFIL deminers have cleared access to an additional 134 points to be marked (see also para. 41 below). Despite the renewed commitment by both parties, difficulties remain in finding practical solutions to the contentious points, and this has resulted in delays. The Advisory Committee trusts that the Mission will continue to monitor the situation. 18. The headquarters of UNIFIL is located in Naqoura, with a small office in Beirut primarily to facilitate the transit of mission personnel and equipment. The Secretary-General indicates that the establishment of a UNIFIL office in Tel Aviv, which is to provide enhanced liaison and coordination functions with the military and other relevant authorities of Israel, remains a priority of the Mission (A/65/756, para. 6; see also para. 31 below). 19. The Secretary-General describes the planning assumptions and mission support initiatives in paragraphs 7 to 18 of his report on the proposed budget (A/65/756). The results-based-budgeting frameworks are presented in two components, namely, operations and support (ibid., para. 3). B. Resource requirements 20. The proposed budget for UNIFIL for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 amounts to $542,785,700, representing an increase of $24,075,500, or 4.6 per cent, in gross terms, compared with the appropriation of $518,710,200 for 2010/11. In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls that in its previous report on the financing of UNIFIL (A/64/660/Add.14, para. 57), it recommended appropriation of an amount of $534,489,200 for 2010/11, representing a reduction of 5.3 per cent to the estimated requirements of $564,536,900 proposed by the Secretary-General. In its resolution 64/282, the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $518,710,200, or 8.1 per cent less than the Secretary-General's proposal. 21. The proposed budget for 2011/12 provides for the deployment of 15,000 military contingent personnel, 372 international staff, 726 national staff, and 3 general temporary assistance positions for international staff. 22. The major increases proposed for 2011/12 are reflected under (a) military contingents ($7,864,700); (b) international staff ($5,838,500); (c) national staff ($2,968,000); (d) facilities and infrastructure ($4,968,500); and (e) naval transportation ($1,449,100). An analysis of variances is provided in section IV of the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed budget (A/65/756). 1. Military and police personnel Category Approved 2010/11a Proposed 2011/12a,b Variance b See also para. 24 below. 23. The estimated requirements for military contingent personnel for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 amount to $303,479,800, an increase of $7,864,700, or 2.7 per cent, compared with the appropriation for 2010/11. The increased requirements reflect additional costs in the following areas: (a) Troop cost reimbursements, owing to the application of a delayed deployment factor of 18 per cent for 2011/12, compared with 20 per cent for 2010/11; (b) Travel on emplacement, rotation and repatriation, based on actual expenditure patterns and the increased number of troop rotations to 43 from 40 for 2010/11; (c) Rations, owing to the increase in the number of days of provision from 365 to 366. 24. Upon enquiry concerning the current and projected deployment of military contingents and the related delayed deployment factors, the Advisory Committee was informed that as at 28 February 2011, the troop strength stood at 11,710, which represented a delayed deployment factor of 21.9 per cent. It was expected that a total of 920 military contingent personnel, including 250 for the Maritime Task Force, would be deployed between 1 April and 1 July 2011, which would bring the troop strength to 12,630, or a delayed deployment factor of 15.8 per cent, by 1 July 2011. The Advisory Committee was further informed that the projected delayed deployment factor of 18 per cent proposed for 2011/12 took into account the actual deployment trends, as well as future deployment and replacement projections. 2. Civilian personnel Approved 2010/11 Proposed 2011/12 Temporary positions Total 25. The estimated requirements for civilian personnel for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 amount to $99,788,800, an increase of $8,825,000, or 9.7 per cent, compared with the appropriation for 2010/11, mainly related to increased requirements under: (a) International staff ($5,838,500): for salaries, common staff costs and staff assessment, attributable to the application of step 6 of the international salary scales instead of step 5 as was applied in 2010/11; the applied vacancy factor of 11 per cent, compared with 22 per cent for 2010/11, based on lower actual vacancy for 2010/11; and the proposed abolishment of 24 vacant posts and conversion of 5 posts to national General Service posts; (b) National staff ($2,968,000): for salaries and staff assessment, owing to the application of a vacancy factor of 9 per cent for national General Service staff, compared with 16 per cent for 2010/11, and the abolishment of 20 vacant posts. Vacancy rates 26. Vacancy factors have been applied to the estimates for 2011/12 as follows: 11 per cent for international staff, 33 per cent for National Officers and 9 per cent for national General Service staff. Upon enquiry concerning the calculation of vacancy rates for international and national staff for 2011/12, the Advisory Committee was informed that the proposed vacancy rates took into consideration the actual incumbency trends at UNIFIL, as well as the number of posts that would be abolished or converted pursuant to section C of General Assembly resolution 65/248 on the harmonization of conditions of service (see para. 29 below). 27. In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls the higher vacancy rates (21 per cent and above) that prevailed at UNIFIL in the periods from 2007/08 to 2009/10, as well as the high number of vacant posts (A/64/660/Add.14, paras. 32 to 34). The Committee notes from the report of the Board of Auditors that UNIFIL had abolished 104 posts and engaged in active recruitment processes, which resulted in the reduction of the mission's vacancy rates to 15 per cent for international staff and 11 per cent for national General Service staff as at 20 January 2011 (A/65/5 (Vol. II), chap. II, para. 220 and A/65/756, sect. VI.C). The Advisory Committee notes the actions taken by UNIFIL and encourages the Mission to continue its efforts in this regard. Recommendations on posts 28. A summary of the proposed changes in staffing is presented in annex II to the present report. A detailed description of the changes proposed under each component is provided in the budget document (A/65/756). As indicated in the table above, the proposed staffing level represents a decrease of 44 posts. 29. It is indicated in paragraph 18 of the proposed budget that, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/248 on the United Nations common system, the budget proposal for 2011/12 reflects the proposed abolishment of 44 posts (1 P-5, 3 P-4, 4 P-3, 16 Field Service, 1 National Officer and 19 national General Service) and the proposed conversion of 5 Field Service posts to national General Service posts. The Advisory Committee's views and comments on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 65/248 will be reflected in its general report on administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/65/743). 30. Further to the proposed conversion of 5 Field Service posts to national General Service posts, the Advisory Committee was informed during its meetings with representatives of the Secretary-General that one additional conversion of a P-4 post for a Civil Affairs Officer to a senior National Civil Affairs Officer post was recently proposed, which is not reflected in the proposed budget for 2011/12, nor in annex II to the present report. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the Civil Affairs Office of UNIFIL was mandated to represent UNIFIL and liaise with, inter alia, municipal officials, community representatives, civil society and religious groups. The Committee was further informed that the mission would benefit from having a National Officer at a senior level who could engage directly with senior Government officials and local communities to strengthen the links between UNIFIL and local communities and to undertake activities related to confidence-building and conflict prevention and management. Furthermore, the Committee was informed that the proposed conversion would entail a reduction of $133,200 to the budget of $542,785,700 proposed by the Secretary-General in document A/65/756. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the additional conversion of a P-4 Civil Affairs Officer post to a senior National Civil Affairs Officer post, which, in its view, will contribute to building the capacity of national staff. Tel Aviv office 31. The proposed abolishment of 44 posts pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/248 as described in paragraph 29 above includes 4 posts for a UNIFIL office in Tel Aviv (1 P-5, 1 P-4 and 2 Field Service) (A/65/756, para. 32). The Secretary-General indicates that, given the continuing absence of an agreement on the level of representation and the mandate of the office, no provision for the office is included in the proposed budget for 2011/12. However, if the office were to be established in the 2011/12 period, staffing and funds would be met from within existing approved resources and reported in the performance report (ibid., para. 13). Reassignment of posts 32. The Secretary-General has also proposed a number of reassignments of posts for 2011/12, including those to be reassigned for the creation of: (a) A strategic dialogue mechanism secretariat in the Office of the Force Commander under the auspices of the Deputy Force Commander, as a follow-up action to the recommendations of the joint technical review by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and UNIFIL, which was completed in January 2010, in particular relating to the establishment of a formalized regular strategic dialogue mechanism with the Lebanese Armed Forces (ibid., paras. 9 and 28). To this end, it is proposed that the existing P-5 post of Chief Movement Control Officer be reassigned to the Office of the Force Commander as a Political Affairs Officer at the P-4 level. The Advisory Committee notes that the conclusions of the technical review were conveyed by the Secretary-General to the Security Council in his letter of 12 February 2010 (S/2010/86). The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that three strategic dialogue meetings had taken place since then. The Committee was also informed that UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces were currently engaged in preparing the terms of reference and rules of procedure as a matter of priority; (b) A Fire Safety Unit in the Security Section through the reassignment of 5 posts (1 P-2 and 4 national General Service), for the mission's Sector West and Sector East and in the Beirut Office, to be consistent with the policy directive of the Department of Field Support and the Department of Safety and Security (ibid., paras. 15, 39 and 40). 33. The Secretary-General further indicates that one of the objectives of the proposed changes in staffing is to increase focus on risk management, quality assurance and monitoring and compliance for performance reporting, complementary to the compliance and monitoring function created under the Office of the Director of Mission Support in 2010/11 (ibid., para. 17). The Advisory Committee recalls its support for the establishment of the Compliance and Monitoring Unit in the context of its review of the proposed budget for UNIFIL for 2010/11, as well as its request for an update on the work of the new Unit in the context of the budget proposal for 2011/12 (A/64/660/Add.14, para. 38). In this connection, the Committee notes that, as an initial effort, UNIFIL has adopted a risk register that is presently being supplemented with a treatment plan, to be actively managed by the Compliance and Monitoring Unit (A/65/756, sect. VI.B). The reporting on key performance indicators has been rolled out in two functional areas, namely, personnel and procurement, and will be extended to other areas before the end of the current financial period. The Secretary-General believes that this activity reflects a more proactive approach by the mission to mitigate risk through increased attention to potential risk areas and active monitoring of performance benchmarks. The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts undertaken by UNIFIL to mitigate risk and requests that further progress in this area be reported in the context of future budget submissions. 34. The Advisory Committee recalls that the majority of the proposed staffing changes for 2010/11 were in connection with the Mission's rationalization efforts (A/64/660/Add.14, para. 36). In this connection, the Committee notes from the Secretary-General's proposed budget that the mission's support component is undergoing restructuring in 2010/11 based on the rationalization of tasks and that the centralized approach to service delivery has proven to be more effective and efficient (A/65/756, para. 16). The Committee expects that the results achieved, including efficiency gains, and lessons learned from the rationalization exercise will be reported in the performance report for 2010/11. 35. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the staffing changes proposed by the Secretary-General for 2011/12. 3. Operational costs Apportioned 2010/11 36. The estimated operational requirements for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 amount to $139,517,100, an increase of $7,385,800, or 5.6 per cent, compared with the appropriation for 2010/11. The increase is attributable mainly to higher requirements under: (a) Facilities and infrastructure ($4,968,500): increased requirements for petrol, oil and lubricants, primarily attributable to a higher estimated unit cost of $0.63 per litre for diesel, compared with $0.47 per litre applied for 2010/11; field defence supplies, owing to an additional 15,000 m3 of aggregates to complete the Blue Line road link 8; and the acquisition of fuel tanks and pumps, as a result of the proposed relocation of the mission's fuel station and reserve stock because of their vulnerability at their current location at headquarters in Naqoura; (b) Naval transportation ($1,449,100): increased requirements for rental and operations in relation to the proposed deployment of 8 vessels and 2 helicopters, compared with 7 vessels and 2 helicopters for 2010/11 (see also para. 38 below). Maritime Task Force 37. A brief description of the activities and related development of the Maritime Task Force is contained in paragraph 7 of the proposed budget for 2011/12, as well as in paragraphs 24 and 51 of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council (S/2011/91). The Secretary-General indicates that the Maritime Task Force continues to carry out its dual mandate of conducting maritime interdiction operations and training the Lebanese naval forces. 38. The Advisory Committee enquired concerning the current operational capacity of the Maritime Task Force and the provision proposed for 2011/12. The information received by the Committee is reflected in the table below. Type of vessel Number of vessels currently deployed Number of vessels budgeted for 2010/11a Number of vessels proposed for 2011/12b Cost estimates for 2011/12b (United States dollars) Frigate Corvette Green/brown assets Combat support ship Helicopter Total (including helicopter) a See A/65/756, para. 87. b Cost estimates exclude the provision of $1,483,000 for transit costs and $196,100 for liability insurance for the vessels and helicopters. 39. With respect to standard operating procedures to verify the contingent-owned equipment of the Maritime Task Force, the Advisory Committee recalls that the Board of Auditors expressed concern about the unavailability of such procedures and that the Committee concurred with the Board that the Department of Field Support should review and incorporate the procedures developed into the next revision of the Contingent-Owned Equipment Manual (A/63/746/Add.11, paras. 34 and 35). The Committee further recalls that it requested an update on the procedures in the context of the budget proposal for 2011/12 (A/64/660/Add.14, para. 48). 40. In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes the update provided in the proposed budget document (A/65/756, sect. VI.B). According to the Secretary-General, the procedures used for the verification of the Maritime Task Force units are included in the relevant UNIFIL guidelines. The Secretary-General indicates that UNIFIL continues to face the challenges of completing contingent-owned-equipment verification in respect of the Maritime Task Force assets. The procedures currently in place are based on the mode of operation of the Task Force and the fact that ships can only operate with all equipment and services listed in the letters of assist and memorandums of understanding. A standard operating procedure was developed to consider the monthly tracking table as the operational usage report, which has been endorsed by Headquarters and is being implemented to the satisfaction of the Department of Field Support and the contributing countries to the Maritime Task Force. The Advisory Committee requests that information on the steps taken to incorporate the procedures to verify the contingent-owned equipment of the Maritime Task Force into the Contingent-Owned Equipment Manual be provided in the context of the budget submission for 2012/13. Mine detection and mine-clearing supplies 41. A provision of $1,431,500 is proposed for mine detection and mine-clearing services for 2011/12 (A/65/756, para. 75). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the current mandate of the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Centre within UNIFIL was to provide mine action technical advice and assistance, with a special focus on ensuring the preparedness of mine clearance teams and explosive ordnance disposal teams for the performance of Blue Line clearance operations. Furthermore, the Centre was responsible for mine action information management and the provision of support to the Lebanese Mine Action Centre as required, including the accreditation, quality assurance and post-clearance confirmation processes. For 2011/12, the Centre would continue to support clearance operations for an additional 135 points along the Blue Line, as well as for the possible clearance of 146 minefields north of the Lebanese Armed Forces road, for a total of approximately 47,304 mines, which would result in the release of areas of approximately 1,846,865 m2 back to the local community. Quick-impact projects 42. A provision of $500,000 is proposed for 2011/12 to continue the implementation of quick-impact projects by the mission (ibid., para. 76). The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that UNIFIL planned to use the proposed funding exclusively in the operational areas of battalions that would not have sufficient funding of their own to assist the local population, with a view to offsetting the disparities in support to local communities within the UNIFIL area of operations. The UNIFIL battalions and the communities would be closely involved in both the planning and implementation phases of the projects to ensure close cooperation. The projects would focus on areas related to environment and sanitation, vocational training and the rehabilitation of schools and an orphanage. The Advisory Committee welcomes the coordinated approach adopted by the mission in carrying out its quick-impact projects. The Committee also notes the quick-impact projects implemented by UNIFIL in the performance report for 2009/10 and expects that the projects will continue to be carried out in support of the rehabilitation of infrastructure, conflict resolution and confidence-building (see A/65/608, sect. II.E, expected accomplishment 1.2). Environmental initiatives 43. In the context of its review of the proposed budget for 2010/11, the Advisory Committee welcomed the environmental initiatives taken by UNIFIL (A/64/660/Add.14, para. 49). In this connection, the Committee notes that the mission will continue to focus on projects which have been successfully piloted and will develop a strategy consistent with the environmental policy of the Organization, with particular emphasis on areas in which tangible returns can be achieved with a low investment of resources (A/65/756, para. 12). The Committee encourages the Mission to continue its efforts and to report efficiency gains achieved in the context of the budget submission for 2012/13. 4. Other matters Regional mission cooperation 44. Information with respect to regional mission cooperation is contained in paragraphs 19 to 25 of the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed budget for 2011/12, including cooperation in the following areas: (a) Regional Information and Communications Technology Services. The consolidated regional service, started in July 2010, aims to provide for a coordinated delivery of information and communications technology services to the four missions in geographical proximity, namely UNIFIL, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). The Advisory Committee requested a progress report, including actual cost benefits, in the context of the budget proposal for 2011/12 (A/64/660/Add.14, para. 23). An update on the status of the implementation of the initiative is provided in paragraphs 67 to 69 of document A/65/715. According to the Secretary-General, recurrent annual financial reductions in excess of $3.5 million have been realized, including the reduction of 17 posts from UNIFIL. The Secretary-General also indicates that the performance report for 2010/11 will substantiate the tangible benefits that have been realized since the creation of the regional service (A/65/756, para. 21); (b) Regional training. The Secretary-General indicates that UNIFIL will continue to lead regional training efforts through the provision of training support to other peacekeeping missions and other United Nations entities within the region. The estimated resources of $1,288,100 for 2011/12 would provide for internal and external training activities for international staff (1,058), national staff (1,120) and military contingents (4,979), as described in paragraphs 73 and 74 of the budget document. Details regarding some of the activities, including HIV/AIDS education and prevention, are provided in table 4. Given that the UNIFIL training team leads regional training efforts, the Committee requests that more information with respect to regional training activities, including the level of support provided by UNIFIL to other missions and the ratio between trainers and trainees, be provided in the next budget submission. The Advisory Committee deals with the issue of training in peacekeeping missions in the context of its general report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/65/743); (c) Regional Conduct and Discipline Team. The regional mandate of the UNIFIL Conduct and Discipline Team was clarified by the Department of Field Support in late 2010. UNIFIL can now be officially considered the regional office for the Team, which also covers UNDOF, UNFICYP, UNTSO, the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon and the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy. Pilot project on results-based-budgeting frameworks 45. The Advisory Committee recalls that UNIFIL was one of the three peacekeeping missions participating in a pilot project aimed at improving the presentation of the results-based-budgeting frameworks for the support component. The Committee reflected its initial impression on the presentation in its report on the proposed budget for UNIFIL for 2010/11 (A/64/660/Add.14, paras. 24 and 25). In this connection, the Committee notes that UNIFIL continues to participate in the pilot project and that the framework for the support component presents the indicators of achievement and relevant outputs related to service improvements. Tables 3 and 4 show standard support outputs and mission-specific non-standard and outputs for two comparative financial periods (A/65/756, para. 38). The Advisory Committee's comments with respect to the pilot project will be reflected in its general report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/65/743). Follow-up to the recommendations of the Board of Auditors Replacement of vehicles 46. The Board of Auditors has recommended that all missions perform a cost analysis for the vehicles with high mileage and decide whether to replace such vehicles, taking into account the specific circumstances of the missions (A/64/5 (Vol. II), chap. II, para. 228). The Advisory Committee notes that UNIFIL has analysed its ageing stock; while vehicles considered unsafe for operation have been written off, those in good condition, although they have exceeded their life expectancy, will remain in operation as long as it is economical to maintain the vehicles and safety is not compromised (A/65/756, sect. VI.B). The Advisory Committee welcomes the initiative taken by UNIFIL and expects that other missions will, when conditions allow, undertake such a review and adopt similar practices. Recruitment lead time 47. The Advisory Committee also enquired concerning the responses by the mission to the recommendations by the Board of Auditors contained in its report for the period ended 30 June 2010 (A/65/5 (Vol. II), chap. II). One of the issues raised by the Board was that UNIFIL was one of several missions that had a considerably longer recruitment lead time -- an average of 315 days for international staff and 283 days for national staff, compared with a target of 75 days from the date on which a vacant post is advertised to the date on which it is filled (ibid., para. 221). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that UNIFIL would rely on the implementation of the new staff selection system and the rosters approved by the Field Central Review Board. Access by programme managers to the rosters would considerably shorten selection times by reducing the need for a lengthy evaluation process. The experience of the past few months had shown that the mission could reduce the lead time to within 60 days. The Committee was also informed that a similar system was under development at Headquarters for the recruitment of national staff. UNIFIL expected that any arising vacancies could be filled within a much shorter time frame through the implementation of roster-based recruitment processes. The Advisory Committee welcomes the efforts made by UNIFIL to reduce recruitment lead time and trusts that the Mission will pursue those efforts in the future. V. Conclusion 48. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNIFIL for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 is contained in section V of the performance report (A/65/608). The Advisory Committee recommends that the unencumbered balance of $47,688,400, as well as other income and adjustments in the amount of $15,263,100, be credited to Member States. 49. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 is contained in section V of the proposed budget (A/65/756). The Advisory Committee recommends that, should the Security Council decide to extend the mandate of UNIFIL beyond 31 August 2011, the General Assembly appropriate an amount of $542,652,500 for the maintenance of the Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (see para. 1 above).

United Nations Volunteers Reduced requirements are mainly attributable to a higher average vacancy rate compared to the budgeted rate. Operational costs Government-provided personnel Civilian electoral observers Consultants Official travel Facilities and infrastructure Additional requirements are mainly attributable to petrol, oil and lubricants owing to a higher unit cost for fuel, partially offset by reduced requirements for reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment. Ground transportation Additional requirements are mainly attributable to petrol, oil and lubricants owing to a higher unit cost for fuel. Air transportation Naval transportation Additional requirements are mainly attributable to a change in the fleet composition compared to the budget (an additional patrol boat and corvette, partially offset by one less frigate) as well as higher monthly costs. Communications Reduced requirements are mainly attributable to reimbursements for contingent-owned equipment owing to the delayed deployment of replacement troops following the repatriation of troops. Information technology Medical Special equipment Other supplies, services and equipment Reduced requirements are mainly attributable to lower requirements for uniforms, flags and decals as well as for training fees and supplies.
