Pursuant to the Declaration (Assembly resolution 40/34, annex), judicial and administrative mechanisms should be established to enable victims to obtain redress through formal or informal procedures, victims should receive the necessary material, medical, psychological and social assistance, personnel concerned should receive training to sensitize them to the needs of victims and victims are entitled to access to the mechanisms of justice. In its resolution 1989/57, the Economic and Social Council recommended that Member States take the necessary steps to give effect to the provisions contained in the Declaration. In its resolution 2006/20, the Economic and Social Council requested the Secretary-General to convene an intergovernmental expert group meeting to design an information-gathering instrument in relation to United Nations standards and norms related primarily to victim issues and to study ways and means to promote their use and application. As a result, the Questionnaire on United Nations Standards and Norms Related Primarily to Victim Issues was developed at the Meeting of the Intergovernmental Expert Group to Develop an Information-Gathering Instrument on United Nations Standards and Norms Related Primarily to Victim Issues held in Vienna from 27 to 29 November 2006 (E/CN.15/2007/3). In December 2007, the Secretary-General invited Member States, relevant United Nations agencies and entities and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to reply to the questionnaire, including any comments or suggestions they might have in relation to the information-gathering instrument. The present report contains information based on replies received from the following States: Azerbaijan, Canada, Cape Verde, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Ireland, Jordan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Romania, Samoa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United States of America and Zimbabwe.

One State reported that it had set up special governmental bodies, such as national committees, to follow up on the implementation of relevant legislation (El Salvador). Concerning the nature of the legislative measures enacted to protect and assist victims, some States reported that they had established services to assist victims, including social assistance, legal counsel, economic compensation and social rehabilitation (Estonia, Latvia, Netherlands and Sweden). Six countries described measures taken to safeguard, through legislation, specific policies, programmes and guidelines, the rights of victims during the criminal process by, for example, allowing anonymous testimonies, issuing restraining orders and hearing witnesses outside the courtroom (Canada, Finland, Lithuania, Norway, Peru and Spain). A number of States had enacted specific legislation to protect the victims of specific crimes such as terrorist attacks, sexual exploitation, trafficking in humans, domestic violence and violence against children (Cape Verde, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Romania and United States).

Most reporting States had adopted measures to prevent the victimization of persons known to be at high risk of becoming victims (Azerbaijan, Canada, Estonia, Germany, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, United States and Zimbabwe). X. International standards and cooperation Some States had made available, in their official languages, the texts of the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (Canada, El Salvador, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, Sweden, Turkey (through the Internet) and United States) and of the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (Canada, El Salvador, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan and United States). In some States, professionals working with victims have been made aware of the provisions of the Declaration (Canada, El Salvador, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Spain and Sweden) and professionals working with child victims and witnesses have been made aware of the provisions of the Guidelines (Canada, El Salvador, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Pakistan and Sweden). Some reporting States had adopted measures to cooperate with other States in the provision of assistance to victims of crime (including Azerbaijan, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Mexico, Norway, Panama, Peru, Spain, Sweden and United States). XI. Technical assistance Many States had encountered no difficulty in using and applying the United Nations standards and norms regarding victims (Azerbaijan, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Spain, Sweden, Turkey and United States). Although some States reported that there was a lack of awareness of opportunities for receiving technical assistance through United Nations agencies (El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Pakistan, Samoa and Turkey), other States reported being aware of such opportunities (Canada, Germany, Norway, Panama, Peru, Spain, Sweden, United States and Zimbabwe). Some States reported that there was a need for technical assistance in the use and application of United Nations standards and norms, primarily with regard to victim-related issues (Azerbaijan, El Salvador, Estonia, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Samoa and Zimbabwe). Some States reported that they were in a position to provide technical assistance (e.g. by sharing good practices) in the use and application of United Nations standards and norms, primarily with regard to victim-related issues (Azerbaijan, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Spain, Sweden, United States and Zimbabwe). XII. Information reported by United Nations agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations Various organizations also provided information on the use and application of standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. In that regard, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute reported on the projects that it was carrying out, including, for example, the European Crime and Safety Survey and the projects on strengthening the rights of children and youth in Angola, strengthening the juvenile justice system in Mozambique and countering trafficking in women and adolescents from Nigeria to Italy. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights provided information on its activities related to victims, including in the areas of setting standards and providing technical assistance. With regard to the former, the Office mentioned its support for the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (General Assembly resolution 61/177, annex). The Office also indicated that it had been supporting the finalization of two sets of principles addressing the rights of victims: the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law (Assembly resolution 60/147, annex) and the updated set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1). In the area of technical assistance, the Office reported that it provided such assistance to the following long-standing humanitarian trust funds: the Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, the Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery and the Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations. The Asia and Far East Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders reported on the relevant training courses and seminars it was organizing. The Japan Federation of Bar Associations reported on the status of existing victim-related regulations in Japan. SOS attentats reported on the status of existing victim-related regulations in France. The National Council of German Women's Organizations reported on relevant activities, including the promotion of the adoption of adequate laws for the protection of victims of crime, which should include provisions on restitution and rehabilitation; the Council also reported on issues such as women's heath, domestic violence and trafficking in women and children. XIII. Conclusions and recommendations The replies received indicate that Member States have implemented, at least in part, the measures contained in the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. Approaches to implementing the recommendations contained in the Declaration vary widely. For example, the legislative measures concerning victims range from the establishment of special assistance services to the enactment of procedural legislation. The difficulties encountered in implementing legislative measures also differ significantly from country to country; they range from a lack of awareness of available services to cultural restraints. Some difficulties are attributable to differences in the judicial process. Most reporting States indicated that they provided material and psychological assistance to victims and that they had adopted national policies and standards for the delivery of assistance to victims. Most States reported that victims of crime had access to State-funded legal assistance throughout the criminal justice process. In most countries, victims received proper information on various issues in a timely manner and in a language they understood. In most countries, the authorities received training on victim-related issues. Most national legislations allowed victims to obtain restitution from the offender in the context of criminal proceedings and in most countries there was a State compensation scheme available to victims. Some States reported that they needed United Nations technical assistance but were unaware of opportunities for receiving such assistance through United Nations agencies. In the light of the above, the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice may wish to consider: (a) Inviting Member States that need assistance to strengthen and improve their national mechanisms to assist and protect victims, to request such assistance from relevant United Nations agencies and offices, in particular from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC); (b) Encouraging Member States to make use of existing UNODC tools and handbooks on victim assistance and protection; (c) Inviting Member States to provide resources, including financial resources, to UNODC in support of its activities to assist States in strengthening and improving their capacity to protect and provide assistance to victims; (d) Requesting UNODC to continue, in cooperation with relevant partners, to provide advisory services and technical assistance to Member States, upon request, in the area of victim assistance and protection.
