General Assembly Sixty-fourth session Agenda item 15 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Sixty-fifth year Identical letters dated 9 September 2010 from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government, I transmit herewith two complaints against Israeli enemy forces, which on 5 July 2010 crossed the withdrawal line and entered liberated Lebanese territory and on 4 August 2010 violated Lebanese territorial waters (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 15, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Nawaf Salam Ambassador Permanent Representative Lebanese Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants At 6.30 a.m. on Monday, 5 July 2010, an Israeli enemy military patrol comprising some 12 servicemen crossed the withdrawal line at Saddanah, on the outskirts of Shab'a, and penetrated some 40 metres into liberated Lebanese territory. They searched the area before leaving at approximately 7 a.m. The entry of Israeli forces into Lebanese territory constitutes a flagrant violation of Lebanese sovereignty, international law and Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), and a threat to international peace and security. At 2.39 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 August 2010, an Israeli enemy military launch violated Lebanese territorial waters some 500 metres off Naqurah and approached a Lebanese fishing boat north of the line of buoys. The entry of Israeli naval forces into Lebanese territorial waters constitutes a flagrant violation of Lebanese sovereignty, international law and Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), and a threat to international peace and security.
