The Counter-Terrorism Committee has considered the report carefully, with the assistance of its experts, and has written to the Permanent Representative of Mozambique to set out its preliminary comments. Mozambique has been requested to provide a response in the form of a third report by 19 August 2004. I should be grateful if you could arrange for the present letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Alexander V.
