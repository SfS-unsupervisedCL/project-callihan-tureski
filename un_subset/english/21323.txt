Item 74 (f) of the provisional agenda* General and complete disarmament: promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation Letter dated 14 August 2003 from the Permanent Representative of Tajikistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General In my capacity as the representative of the country which currently chairs the Collective Security Treaty Organization, I have the honour to transmit to you the statement of the Secretary-General and the plenipotentiary representatives of the Member States of the Collective Security Treaty Organization on the situation on the Korean peninsula of 8 August 2003 (see annex). I would be grateful if the text of the present letter and its annex could be distributed as a document of the General Assembly, under item 74 (f) of the provisional agenda of the fifty-eighth regular session of the General Assembly. (Signed) Rashid Alimov [Original: Russian] Statement by the Secretary-General and plenipotentiary representatives of the States Parties to the Treaty on Collective Security concerning the situation on the Korean peninsula Dangerous tension is building up on the Korean peninsula and around it, which, one way or another, affects the interests of many States. The military and political threats, the advancement of various preconditions for negotiations and the whipping up of passions are having a most negative effect on stability and security in the region and in the world as a whole. Both on account of their geographical proximity to what is taking place and in accordance with their principled position in favour of just political solutions to disputed situations, the States Parties to the Treaty on Collective Security welcome the agreement to begin six-party negotiations and wish them success. They appeal to all those involved to show the utmost restraint, goodwill and a sense of responsibility during the negotiating process. Individual and collective efforts are now vital to reduce the tension and create favourable conditions for a speedy political settlement with a view to preserving the non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula, strengthening the regime of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and ensuring regional and international security. For our part, our States intend vigorously to facilitate this. 8 August 2003
