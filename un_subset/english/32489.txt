The Human Rights Committee, at its eighty-fourth and eighty-fifth sessions, held from 11 to 29 July 2005 and from 17 October to 3 November 2005 respectively, continued its discussion on the proposals for harmonizing guidelines on reporting to all treaty bodies. It also discussed the proposal for a unified standing treaty body. The Committee continued to work on a revised draft general comment on article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the right to a fair trial. It also amended its rules of procedure so as to enable its pre-sessional Working Group on Communications to declare a communication inadmissible. To that end, the Committee introduced the following new rule 93 (3): "A working group established under rule 95, paragraph 1, of these rules of procedure may decide to declare a communication inadmissible, when it is composed of at least five members and all members so agree. The decision will be transmitted to the Committee plenary, which may confirm it and adopt it without further discussion. If any Committee member requests a plenary discussion, the plenary will examine the communication and take a decision."1 3. At its sixty-seventh session, held from 2 to 19 August 2005, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination held a preliminary discussion on the proposed unified standing treaty body. Concerning its working methods, the Committee decided to designate one or several Special Rapporteurs for follow-up on opinions adopted by the Committee under its individual communications procedure. The Committee also took a decision on follow-up to the declaration on the prevention of genocide which it had adopted at the end of the thematic discussion on that issue during its sixty-sixth session. The decision identifies indicators of systematic and massive patterns of racial discrimination. The Committee adopted general recommendation No. 31 on the prevention of racial discrimination in the administration and functioning of the criminal justice system. 4. At its thirty-fourth session, held from 2 to 21 May 2005, the Committee against Torture adopted new guidelines on the form and content of initial reports under article 19 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The new guidelines2 aim to assist States parties in fulfilling their reporting obligations. They replace guidelines the Committee had adopted at its sixth session in April 1991. 5. At its thirty-ninth session, held from 16 May to 3 June 2005, the Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted General Comment No. 6 on the treatment of unaccompanied and separated children outside their country of origin.3 The Committee also adopted a decision on the modalities for the consideration of reports under the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. At its fortieth session, held from 12 to 30 September 2005, the Committee adopted General Comment No. 74 on implementing children's rights in early childhood. On 16 September, the Committee held its annual day of discussion, which was devoted to the issue of children without parental care, and adopted recommendations on that issue. The Committee also decided that its next day of general discussion would focus on the right of the child to express his or her views and would take place at the Committee's forty-third session in September 2006. B. Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 6. The Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, at its fifty-seventh session held from 25 July to 12 August 2005, adopted a number of resolutions and decisions relevant to the work of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.5 They included resolution 2005/8 on the Social Forum; resolution 2005/9 on the implementation of existing human rights norms and standards in the context of the fight against extreme poverty; resolution 2005/26 on the World Programme for Human Rights Education; resolution 2005/27 on systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflicts; and resolution 2005/28 on harmful traditional practices affecting the health of women and the girl child. 7. In its resolution 2005/8, the Subcommission announced the theme for the Social Forum in 2006, "The fight against poverty and the right to participation: the role of women", and requested Chin-sung Chung, one of its members, to prepare a working paper on the challenges of women's participation in policies and strategies to combat poverty and extreme poverty to be submitted to its next session in 2006. The Subcommission also invited the Chairperson of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to take part in the next session of the Social Forum and make a presentation on the chosen theme. 8. In its resolution 2005/27, the Subcommission noted the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security.6 It requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit an updated report at its fifty-eighth session on systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices during armed conflicts. 9. In resolution 2005/28, the Subcommission welcomed the ninth report7 of the Special Rapporteur on traditional practices affecting the health of women and the girl child and noted with regret that the submitted report would be the last on the subject. The Subcommission invited the Commission on Human Rights to request its Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences to continue to consider and examine, in a more systematic way, the effects of harmful traditional practices affecting the health of women and girls as an integral part of her mandate. The Subcommission requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist by raising funds for the organization of seminars, especially the organization of a first seminar to be held in Europe, in light of disturbing information on the increase of harmful practices in that region. Lastly the Subcommission reiterated the proposal to hold three seminars in Africa, Asia and Europe to review progress achieved since 1985. C. General Assembly 10. The Third Committee proposed for adoption by the General Assembly at its sixtieth session in 2005 several resolutions that are relevant to the work of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, including a resolution on violence against women migrant workers and a resolution on the in-depth study on all forms of violence against women. 11. The draft resolution on violence against women migrant workers (A/C.3/60/L.16/Rev.1) underlined the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions, within their respective mandates, addressing the problem of violence against women migrant workers, and in protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of this group of women. The resolution encouraged the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to consider developing a general recommendation on the situation of women migrant workers. The Secretary-General was requested to report on the issue to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session in 2007. 12. The draft resolution on the in-depth study on all forms of violence against women (A/C.3/60/L.12) welcomed the work undertaken so far, and stressed the importance of close collaboration with, inter alia, United Nations treaty bodies, including the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The resolution extended to the sixty-first session of the General Assembly in 2006 the deadline for submission of the study. 13. By the time the present report had been finalized, the Third Committee of the General Assembly had adopted a resolution on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (A/C.3/60/L.17), noting decision 33/I by which the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women requested an extension of its meeting time.8 Committees dealing with the budgetary implications of the extension had not yet taken action on the resolution. The resolution authorized the Committee to hold three annual sessions of three weeks each, with a one-week pre-sessional working group for each session, effective from January 2006, as a temporary measure. It also continued to authorize two annual sessions of the Working Group on Communications under the Optional Protocol to the Convention. The resolution further authorized the Committee to meet on a temporary basis in 2006 and 2007 for up to seven days in parallel working groups during its third (July/August) annual session in 2006, and its first (January) and third (July/August) annual sessions in 2007, taking due account of equitable geographical distribution, for the purpose of considering reports submitted under article 18 of the Convention. The Committee will receive an oral update on the final outcome of action taken by the Assembly. 14. The 2005 World Summit took place from 14 to 16 September 2005. At the Summit, world leaders agreed to improve the effectiveness of the human rights treaty bodies, including through more timely reporting, improved and streamlined reporting procedures and technical assistance to States to enhance their reporting capacities and further enhance the implementation of their recommendations.9 The outcome document will be made available to Committee members. D. Reform proposals for treaty bodies 15. In follow-up to the points of agreement of the fourth inter-committee meeting and the seventeenth meeting of chairpersons of human rights treaty bodies, held at Geneva on 23 and 24 June 2005 (see A/60/278), including in regard to proposals on harmonized guidelines on reporting under the international human rights treaties and guidelines for an expanded common core document and treaty-specific targeted reports,10 the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women designated Hanna Beate Schöpp-Schilling to participate in a technical working group of seven members, one from each Committee. The working group, which was given the task of finalizing the draft harmonized guidelines for consideration and eventual adoption by each of the committees, was scheduled to meet from 8 to 9 December 2005. The Committee will be briefed by Ms. Schöpp-Schilling on the results of the meeting. 16. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights continued to develop the proposal to create a unified standing treaty body to replace the currently existing seven human rights treaty bodies, as suggested in the Plan of Action of May 2005 (see A/59/2005/Add.3, annex). Preparation of a concept paper on a unified standing treaty body is under way. The paper will be discussed in an informal brainstorming meeting in May 2006 and considered during the fifth inter-committee meeting and eighteenth meeting of chairpersons in June 2006. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights hosted an online discussion from 1 November to 6 December 2005 to provide further opportunities for interested stakeholders to submit their views. Members of the Committee were informed via the Office's list server, as well as directly by the Division for the Advancement of Women. The High Commissioner also wrote to the Committee's Chairperson, inviting the Committee's views. The Chairperson subsequently wrote to experts on the matter. The Committee will receive an oral update on any further developments. 17. Based on a decision taken by the Committee at its thirty-third session, the Chairperson invited the High Commissioner for Human Rights to meet with the Committee during its thirty-fourth session to discuss proposals pertaining to the human rights treaty bodies in the High Commissioner's 2005 Plan of Action. The High Commissioner has confirmed that she will meet with the Committee on 27 January 2006. III. Reports to be considered by the Committee at future sessions 18. All States parties selected by the Committee for presentation of reports at the thirty-fourth session will be able to do so. 19. The Committee proposed to consider the reports of the following States parties at its thirty-fifth session: the combined initial and second periodic reports of Malaysia,11 the combined initial and second periodic reports of Turkmenistan,12 the combined initial, second and third periodic reports of Bosnia and Herzegovina,13 the combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of Cape Verde,14 the combined initial, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth periodic reports of Saint Lucia,15 the combined second, third, fourth and fifth periodic reports of Malawi,16 the sixth periodic report of Romania,17 and, in case of submission, the sixth periodic report of Mexico.18 Those States parties were informed of the possibility that the thirty-fifth session would take place in May 2006, pending approval by the General Assembly of the Committee's request for an extension of its meeting time. 20. Subsequently, Cape Verde and Mexico indicated their preference for presentation of their reports at the thirty-sixth session, in August 2006. The Secretariat has approached two other States parties for possible presentation of their reports at the thirty-fifth session. The Committee will receive an oral update, pending final action by the General Assembly. 21. The Committee's attention is drawn to the report of the Secretary-General on the status of submission of reports,19 which contains a list of States parties whose reports are overdue. The Committee's attention is also drawn to annex II of the present report, which provides an overview of available reports and dates of previous consideration, as applicable. Excluding the reports that the Committee will consider at its thirty-fourth session, the reports of fifty-seven States parties are available for consideration. IV. Secretariat activities in support of the implementation of the Convention 22. The Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women and the Director of the Division for the Advancement of Women continued their efforts to encourage universal ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, acceptance of the Optional Protocol to the Convention and amendment to article 20, paragraph 1 of the Convention. Those aspects are regularly addressed by the Special Adviser, the Director and staff of the Division in meetings with, and briefings for, representatives of Member States, entities of the United Nations system and civil society organizations in training workshops and other outreach activities. In particular, the Special Adviser discussed with authorities the importance of ratification of the Convention during her mission to the Sudan, 4 to 11 September 2005. 23. Cooperation and collaboration in support of the work of the human rights treaty bodies has also remained an important element in the joint work plan of the Division and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (see E/CN.4/2006/59 and E/CN.6/2006/9). 24. In May 2005, as part of its technical cooperation programme, the Division convened a regional training workshop for government officials on reporting on and implementation of the Convention and on the use of the Optional Protocol, as well as a judicial colloquium on the application of international human rights law at the domestic level. Both events took place in Santiago, Chile, and were organized in cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). The training workshop was facilitated by one Committee member and one expert in international law from the Central American University. A total of seventeen government officials from nine countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay) participated in the workshop. The judicial colloquium was facilitated by a former member and chairperson of the Human Rights Committee, who was at that time a judge of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, and by the same expert on international law from the Central American University who facilitated the training workshop. A total of twelve judicial officers from eight countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay) attended the colloquium. 25. The Division, in collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, continued preparations for a subregional workshop on the follow-up to the concluding comments and observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination against Women, to be held in Cairo, Egypt, from 19 to 22 December 2005. The workshop, to be hosted by the National Council for Women, aims to build the capacity of Government representatives as well as representatives of national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to follow-up on and implement the concluding comments/observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The subregional workshop will bring together representatives from six countries of the North African region: Algeria, Egypt, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. Four experts of the Committee have been invited to participate in the event. 26. The Division, with the Netherlands Institute for Human Rights at the University of Utrecht, continued preparation of a manual on implementation of the Convention and its Optional Protocol. The manual is an advocacy tool to build the capacity of States parties to enhance effective implementation of the Convention and to prepare both initial and periodic reports. Further to the validation workshop held in Utrecht, the Netherlands, in May 2005, the draft chapters of the manual are being revised. 27. The Division collaborated for the third year with the Inter-Parliamentary Union in a one-day briefing and discussion with parliamentarians from countries whose reports have recently been or will soon be considered by the Committee. The meeting took place on 20 October 2005. Feride Acar, a former member of the Committee, served as an expert and resource person at the event. A staff member of the Division also participated. 28. The Division continued its efforts to raise resources for technical cooperation activities. Based on a contribution received from the Government of Ireland, the Division will be able to continue and expand its activities to support countries emerging from conflict in their efforts to implement the Convention. V. Other issues 29. The following section reviews follow-up steps taken in response to action taken by the Committee at previous sessions. Interaction with national human rights institutions 30. The third inter-committee meeting held at Geneva in June 2004, recommended, inter alia, that national human rights institutions be encouraged to participate in treaty body sessions. Further to that decision, at its thirty-third session, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, for the first time, received information from a national human rights institution (the Irish Human Rights Commission), on the occasion of the consideration of Ireland's combined fourth and fifth periodic report. The Committee requested its secretariat to provide information on the current status of interaction between national human rights institutions and other human rights treaty bodies. The information below expands on information provided to the Committee at its thirty-second session (see CEDAW/C/2005/II/4, paras. 29 to 36). 31. Three human rights treaty bodies -- the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Rights of the Child -- have adopted general comments on their relationship with national human rights institutions. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in its General Comment No. 10 (1998) acknowledged the role of national human rights institutions in monitoring implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights at the national level. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its general recommendation No. XVII of 1993 concerning the establishment of national institutions to facilitate the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, recommended that where national human rights institutions have been established, they should be associated with the preparation of reports and possibly included in government delegations in order to intensify the dialogue between the Committee and the State party concerned. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its General Comment No. 2 (2002), suggested that national human rights institutions should contribute independently to the reporting process and monitor the integrity of government reports to international treaty bodies with respect to children's rights, including through dialogue with the Committee on the Rights of the Child at its pre-sessional working group and with other relevant treaty bodies. The Committee agreed that it would be appropriate for States parties to consult with independent human rights institutions during the preparation of their reports to the Committee. It indicated, however, that States parties needed to respect the independent role of national human rights institutions in providing information to the Committee. In contrast to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Rights of the Child considers that it is not appropriate to delegate to national human rights institutions the drafting of reports or to include them in the government delegation when reports are examined by the Committee. 32. National human rights institutions are provided with copies of the reports to be considered by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The institutions may provide information to any interested member on issues relating to the consideration of reports of States parties, in informal meetings outside the Committee's working hours, and may respond to requests to clarify or supplement such information. At its sixty-sixth and sixty-seventh sessions, held from 21 February to 11 March 2005 and from 1 to 19 August 2005 respectively, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination provided national human rights institutions from Ireland and Zambia with the opportunity to make an oral presentation during the consideration of the reports of those State parties. National human rights institutions of the States parties that are to be considered by the Committee against Torture are routinely informed about the forthcoming consideration and are invited to submit written information. National human rights institutions may also request a private meeting with the Committee on the Rights of the Child.20 Issuance of summary records 33. In the future, issuance of the Committee's summary records is expected to take place within several months of the conclusion of a session. At the same time, the summary records for the thirtieth to thirty-second sessions of the Committee have been issued and posted on the website of the Division, while issuance of the summary records for the thirty-third session of the Committee is expected to be completed prior to the thirty-fourth session. 34. In addition, summary records dating back to 1998 are available in the original drafting language, and many are also available in several other official languages of the United Nations. The Committee's approval is sought for the non-simultaneous release of those documents so that they can be widely disseminated, including via the website of the Division. 35. In the light of the anticipated regular issuance of future summary records, the Secretariat recommends that the Committee dispense with the inclusion of a summary of the introduction by the State party in its annual report. Elimination of this summary will reduce the overall length of the report, and thus respond to the efforts of the General Assembly of the United Nations to limit documentation. The Secretariat has invited reporting States to make their introductory statements available in electronic form for posting on the Division's website. Summary records will also be posted on the site. In-depth study on all forms of violence against women 36. The Division continued the preparation of the in-depth study on all forms of violence against women requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 58/185. An interim report was submitted to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session, summarizing the status of preparations and the activities carried out for the study (A/60/211). The interim report included the preliminary outline for the study. The Committee will be invited to provide further comments and inputs, based on the preliminary outline. Combined second and third periodic report of India 37. The Committee's attention is drawn to the receipt, in October 2005, of the combined second and third periodic reports of India.21 Interaction with entities of the United Nations system 38. The Committee agreed to revise its guidelines for reports by United Nations bodies and entities to make them clearer and more specific. It designated two experts, Dubravka Šimonović and Mary Shanthi Dairiam, to prepare a draft revision for the Committee's consideration. The Secretariat convened an informal briefing for entities of the United Nations system in November 2005, highlighting the Committee's comments at its thirty-third session and providing an overview of the thirty-fourth session. Preparations for future sessions 39. Pending final action by the General Assembly on the extension of the Committee's meeting time and on the basis of consultations with the relevant Secretariat units, the following dates are proposed for the 2006 sessions: (a) Thirty-fourth session: 16 January-3 February 2006; Working Group on Communications under the Optional Protocol: 11-13 January; pre-session working group: 6-10 February (no change); (b) Thirty-fifth session: 15 May-2 June 2006 (includes one holiday); pre-session working group: 5-9 June (Note: no meeting of the Working Group on Communications under the Optional Protocol is planned); (c) Thirty-sixth session: 7-25 August 2006; Working Group on Communications under the Optional Protocol: 31 July-4 August; pre-session working group: 31 July-4 August. At the August session, the Committee will meet up to seven days in parallel working groups. 40. In order to ensure that enough time is available between sessions to allow for translation of the lists of issues and questions, receipt of the responses and their translation into the six languages, the Committee is invited to prepare the lists of issues and questions two sessions in advance rather than at the session immediately prior to the one at which a State presents its report. This would also ensure that States have at least six weeks (as is currently the case) for preparation of the written replies. The following schedule is proposed for preparation of the lists of issues and questions: (a) January 2006: pre-session working group prepares lists of issues and questions for May and August (total of 23 lists); (b) May 2006: no pre-session working group is convened; (c) August 2006: pre-session working group meets prior to session (i.e. 31 July to 4 August, in parallel to Working Group on Communications under the Optional Protocol) and prepares lists for January and May (total of 23 lists); (d) January 2007: pre-session working group prepares lists for August (15 lists); (e) May 2007: no pre-session working group is convened; (f) August 2007: pre-session working group meets prior to session and prepares lists for January (up to 15 lists). 41. The Committee is invited to confirm the States that will present their reports at the thirty-fifth session. It is also invited to select States for reporting at the thirty-sixth through thirty-eighth sessions, in August 2006 and in January and May 2007, to facilitate planning and preparation.
