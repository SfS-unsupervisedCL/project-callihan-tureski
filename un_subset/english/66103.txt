The proposed budget provides for the deployment of 23 military observers, 542 United Nations police officers, 397 formed police unit personnel, 284 international staff (including 11 general temporary assistance positions), 690 national staff (including 5 general temporary assistance positions) and 162 United Nations Volunteers, on average, for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012. The proposed budget also provides for the average monthly deployment of 66 international staff, 4 national staff and 9 United Nations Volunteers for the liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 2013, including the final phase of the liquidation period from 1 May to 30 June 2013 to allow the Serious Crimes Investigation Team to complete its work. The budget also provides for the travel and repatriation of the Mission personnel present in the Mission as at 1 July 2012. The total resource requirements for UNMIT for the financial period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 have been linked to the Mission's objective through a number of results-based-budgeting frameworks, organized according to component (political process; security sector and rule of law; governance, justice, development and humanitarian coordination; and support). The human resources of the Mission have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Mission as a whole. The support component and the Serious Crimes Investigation Team element are divided into two frameworks, the first reflecting the drawdown phase and the second reflecting the liquidation period. Overall, the revised budget of $101,604,900 reflects reduced requirements in the military and police, civilian personnel and operational costs categories of expenditure by $53,824,100, or 34.6 per cent, compared to the original apportionment of $155,429,000, owing to the drawdown and liquidation of the Mission. The civilian personnel category includes costs associated with the separation from service of a large percentage of Mission international staff and the payment of termination indemnities to national staff. The explanations of variances in resource levels, in terms of both human and financial resources, have been linked, where applicable, to specific outputs planned by the Mission.

The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in section IV of the present report. A. Overall 1. The mandate of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1704 (2006). The most recent extension of the mandate was authorized by the Security Council in its resolution 2037 (2012), by which the Council extended the mandate until 31 December 2012. 2. The mandate of the Mission ended on 31 December 2012 on the understanding that, as confirmed by the Government of Timor-Leste on 18 December 2012 and communicated by the Secretary-General to the Security Council on 21 December 2012, the work of the Serious Crimes Investigation Team would continue until June 2013 with the support of the liquidation team within the existing approved appropriation. 3. The Mission was mandated to assist the Security Council in achieving an overall objective, namely, to advance the security and stability of an independent Timor-Leste. 4. The General Assembly, in its resolution 66/270, appropriated an amount of $155,429,000 for the maintenance of UNMIT for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. By the same resolution, the Assembly decided to apportion among Member States the amount of $78,393,550 gross ($74,996,300 net) for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012. Based on that resolution, the amount of $78,393,550 was assessed on Member States for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012. That amount included $75,002,000 for the maintenance of the Mission, $3,215,950 for the support account, and $175,600 for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy (UNLB). 5. Subsequently the General Assembly, in its resolution 67/245, decided to apportion among Member States the additional amount of $11,590,700 for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012. The Assembly further decided to apportion the additional amount of $13,485,550 for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2013, inclusive of $10,094,000 for the anticipated administrative liquidation of the Mission, subject to a decision by the Security Council, for the period from 1 January to 30 April 2013, $3,215,950 for the support account for peacekeeping operations and $175,600 for UNLB for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2013. The additional apportionments were assessed on Member States. 6. Within the overall objective mandated by the Security Council, UNMIT contributed to a number of expected accomplishments by delivering the related key outputs shown in the frameworks below. The frameworks were organized according to components (political process; security sector and rule of law; governance, justice, development and humanitarian coordination; and support), which were derived from the mandate of the Mission. 7. The expected accomplishments led to the fulfilment of the Security Council objective within the lifetime of the Mission and the indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishments during the mandate period. The human resources of UNMIT have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of executive direction and management, which were attributed to the Mission as a whole. Variance analysis and reporting reflect the difference between the apportionment of 2012/13 and revised estimates. 8. UNMIT was a multidimensional integrated mission, which applied a "One United Nations" system approach within an integrated strategic framework covering all mandated areas. The Mission was headed by the Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the Assistant Secretary-General level, assisted by a Deputy Special Representative at the Assistant Secretary-General level for the security sector and rule of law. The Acting Special Representative has remained in Timor-Leste following the end of the UNMIT mandate to lead the liquidation. The final phase of the liquidation, starting on 1 May 2013, allows the Serious Crimes Investigation Team to continue until 30 June 2013 to complete its work. 9. UNMIT operational support to the National Police of Timor-Leste ceased on 31 October 2012, and most UNMIT substantive activities, including capacity-building support to national counterparts, ceased on 30 November 2012. In order to finalize some of the priority areas identified in the integrated strategic framework and to facilitate transition, UNMIT entered into implementation arrangements for the integrated strategic framework with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012. The activities under the arrangement concluded on 31 December 2012. 10. In order to allow the Serious Crimes Investigation Team to complete the investigations into the remaining cases of the serious crimes committed in East Timor in 1999, provisions were made for 20 international staff of the Team, as well as a support team of 17 international staff and 3 United Nations Volunteers until 30 June 2013. 11. The Mission's headquarters in Dili was supported by the four regional centres, located in Baucau, Maliana, Oecussi and Suai. The Mission provided administrative, logistical and technical support to its civilian, military and police personnel in Dili and in the other 12 districts throughout the country. B. Planning assumptions and mission support initiatives 12. UNMIT was mandated to advance the security and stability of an independent Timor-Leste through the Government and relevant institutions, and will assist in promoting the political process, strengthening the rule of law, enhancing a culture of democratic governance and fostering socioeconomic development. 13. Mission mandate implementation over the period from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012 was influenced by the progress of three important processes. The first concerned conduct of the now-concluded parliamentary and presidential elections in 2012 and the formation of the new Government and Opposition. The elections affected all components of the Mission, either directly, as the mission supported the electoral processes, or indirectly, as the political context impacted the work of substantive sections. The second process concerned progress in implementing the Joint Transition Plan in 2012 and transferring UNMIT responsibilities to other stakeholders and the third was the formulation and execution of a staged drawdown plan in keeping with Security Council resolution 2037 (2012). 14. Owing to the drawdown and liquidation of the Mission, the variances are envisaged in the resource requirements as compared to the 2012/13 approved budget with gradual reduction and repatriation of military, police and civilian personnel, as well as contingent-owned equipment, and reduction in training, travel and other operational costs. The primary focus was on the Mission's legacy: concluding achievements, handing over responsibilities, and preparing for the closure of structures and sections. 15. In March 2011, the United Nations police successfully transferred primary policing responsibility to the National Police of Timor-Leste, assumed a support role vis-à-vis the latter and remained available to support its operations when required and requested. The joint development plan of the national police and the United Nations police for 2011/12 defined the following five priority areas for further strengthening the national police: legislation, training, administration, discipline and operations. The Mission's police operational support activities ceased on 31 October 2012 and were followed by the repatriation of the members of the formed police unit and the United Nations police. To assist in the implementation of this plan, the United Nations civilian police advisers continued to facilitate the transfer of skills. With regard to security and the rule of law, the Mission, in collaboration with relevant United Nations country team and bilateral partners, continued to assist the Government to effectively develop security institutions (military and police) and civilian oversight institutions (Secretariats of State for Defence and Security, the national Parliament, the Office of the President and civil society). The Military Liaison Group monitored the general security situation, focusing on the border regions. 16. During the period from 1 July to 30 November 2012, the Mission continued to play a role in human rights monitoring, reporting and training of the national police, the Timor-Leste Defence Force, the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice and other relevant Timorese institutions on international human rights standards and commitments. Throughout the security sector, UNMIT continued to support the authorities of Timor-Leste by providing technical assistance to strengthen capacity for civilian oversight and accountability mechanisms of security institutions, including the military and police. 17. The resource planning assumptions supported programmatic activities until 30 November 2012, when the large portion of the drawdown took effect and reflect the continued support to Timorese institutions in the areas of governance, justice, development and humanitarian coordination. While the priority was to assist in ensuring credible and transparent elections scheduled for 2012, UNMIT continued to support key governance institutions, such as the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Ministry for State Administration and Territorial Management and the Secretariat of State for the Promotion of Equality. The Mission also assisted the Government, in collaboration with the United Nations country team, in focusing on a coordinated approach to justice sector development and in the implementation of the National Strategic Development Plan. 18. The Mission continued to provide effective and efficient administrative support to its components through the mandate period while planning and executing the drawdown of personnel. Drawdown and pre-liquidation activities also included the planning and hand-back of regional locations by 31 December 2012, including the Baucau Regional Support Centre on 3 December 2012, all United Nations police/national police co-location sites in Dili by 10 December 2012 (a total of 47 regional locations have been returned to the Government), the conclusion of large portions of the approved donations, the arranging of repatriation for the formed police units and equipment, the repatriation of the United Nations police element, the conclusion of procurement activities, the resolution of open issues in finance, claims and legal areas and the adoption of a liquidation plan. Four rotary-wing aircraft were maintained until 30 August 2012 and two rotary-wing and one fixed-wing aircraft were retained until 17 December. The fixed-wing aircraft, which was not included in the 2012/13 approved budget, was required from 1 July to 17 December 2012, since the Mission could not achieve the planned contract for emergency services, which was an essential service in the drawdown period, in which a large number of movements were planned. The existing fleet of vehicles, communications infrastructure and information technology equipment was utilized, and equipment identified for transfer to other missions was prepared for shipment. With the exception of operational exigencies, no new materials were purchased during the budget period. 19. The Mission continued its commitment to efficiency gains through the "greening" programme, reducing fuel consumption and strictly monitoring the use of air conditioners and lighting and of two-sided photocopies. 20. Emphasis was placed on supporting national staff in the continuation of their careers after the end of the UNMIT mandate. Training opportunities, the vast majority of which are in-house, have been provided to build national staff capacity to pursue opportunities, and vacancies of United Nations country team member organizations were broadcast to all UNMIT staff. 21. Major activities during the liquidation period include: (a) the hand-back of the remaining UNMIT compounds, to include the Obrigado Barracks 2, the UNMIT Movement Control air terminal, and the Balide Logistics Compound, Formeto Warhouse and the property disposal yards of Tasitola and Farol; (b) the finalization, in consultation with United Nations Headquarters, of the assets disposal plan and its execution, including the destination of non-expendable and expendable assets to be transferred to other peacekeeping operations and to the United Nations Global Service Centre and the commercial sale and physical disposal of assets with accurate records (such as certificates, bill of sales, issue vouchers, etc.); (c) the conduct of joint inspections of the UNMIT-held Government premises, and formalization of the handover and take-over of documents, including the environmental clean-up certificates; (d) the timely and accurate updating of the database for the assets that are transferred/shipped or donated and retention of evidence of the various methods adopted for the disposal of assets; (e) the continuation of support arrangements for the Serious Crimes Investigation Team; (f) the completion of administrative, procurement, personnel, legal and financial actions and residual liquidation tasks; and (g) the submission of routine liquidation reports to the Secretariat and the Global Service Centre. The Mission is disposing of its assets in accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. 22. All international staff are being repatriated gradually in accordance with the drawdown and liquidation plan, with substantive staff (except the Serious Crimes Investigation Team) and the majority of support staff having been repatriated by 31 December 2012, when almost all national staff were also separated. The remaining UNMIT personnel, estimated at 91 international staff and 15 United Nations Volunteers as at January 2013, are being progressively drawn down throughout the liquidation period. During that period, international staff and United Nations Volunteers are being assisted by up to 169 national individual contractors in carrying out such tasks as collecting and preparing equipment for disposal, site preparation and handover, providing security at facilities and closing personnel and financial actions. The employment of individual contractors allows staff to complete their check-out and have their pensions processed, while giving supervisors the flexibility to end the individual contractors' service upon completion of their tasks. Provisions were made for separation costs and termination indemnities, which are paid in line with existing rules and regulations in cases in which staff members' service ends before their contract period has expired. C. Regional mission cooperation 23. The Mission continues to maintain ties with UNLB for transportation and other services, and seeks its support in the drawdown, particularly in identifying appropriate material for shipment to UNLB-held inventories. Moreover, UNMIT maintains close ties with the United Nations country team in the region and continues to assist United Nations agencies, funds and programmes where possible. D. Partnerships, country team coordination and integrated missions 24. Integration and coordination of United Nations activities in Timor-Leste was ensured through the Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General, who is also the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Timor-Leste. UNMIT continues its unified United Nations system approach under the integrated strategic framework. Thematic working groups for coordination and joint decision-making have been established in areas such as democratic governance, justice, gender, humanitarian assistance, HIV/AIDS, communications and operational support. In line with the report of the Secretary-General on civilian capacity in the aftermath of conflict (A/67/312-S/2012/645), UNMIT entered into arrangements with UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and UN-Women to implement the activities during the period from 1 July to 31 December 2013 in the priority areas set out in the integrated strategic framework, namely, strengthening the capacity and functioning of the National Police of Timor-Leste, strengthening the rule of law and the promotion of human rights, and enhancing democratic governance. 25. The National Strategic Development Plan (2011-2030) was published in July 2011, advancing the Government's leadership role in coordinating national and international development efforts. The integrated United Nations system approach continued to support coordinated, transparent, nationally led development initiatives, including those that contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. E. Results-based-budgeting frameworks Executive direction and management 26. Overall mission direction and management was provided by the immediate Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General.

Component 1: political process 27. During the maintenance period, the Mission focused on assisting the President, Parliament, Government and other authorities of Timor-Leste to continue to consolidate democracy and long-term stability and to promote national reconciliation. To this end, UNMIT discharged its good offices in support of all parties in Timor-Leste, in particular political leaders, to address collaboratively political, human rights and security-related issues in promoting a stable and prosperous country. In that regard, the Mission assisted in creating the conditions necessary for the President, Parliament and Government to work in partnership with civil society and the international community so as to respond to the population in a transparent and accountable manner. This included support for building the capacity of the national media in their role of promoting democratic governance. In view of the Mission's closure, a series of information products was produced for Timorese and international audiences capturing its work since 2006. 28. In particular, the Mission was devoted to supporting Timorese institutions and society throughout the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2012. The peaceful conduct and conclusion of elections, including the transition to a newly elected, functioning parliament with Government and Opposition was an important indicator that Timor-Leste was on a path to long-term democracy and stability. Good offices efforts focused on constructive participation by political parties, civil society and local communities in the electoral process and in the post-electoral period. 29. In collaboration with the United Nations country team, the Mission supported the development and implementation of a national strategy to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women. UNMIT encouraged a better gender balance in the public service and women's participation in the political process at all levels.

Component 2: security sector and rule of law 30. The National Police of Timor-Leste resumed policing responsibility in March 2011, a milestone event following which UNMIT police observers increased their focus on capacity-building. In line with the national police strategic development plan and the joint national police/United Nations police development plan, UNMIT police observers, in collaboration with the United Nations country team, continued to advise and train their national counterparts, while remaining ready to provide operational support to the national police until 31 October 2012, as required and requested, in accordance with agreements between UNMIT and the Government of Timor-Leste. 31. The Mission, in particular the Security Sector Support Unit, provided technical advice to assist security sector institutions in enhancing civilian oversight and accountability mechanisms, strengthen the legal framework and the capacity of institutions. 32. The Military Liaison Group continued to monitor the security environment in Timor-Leste, in particular in the border areas, through liaison, patrols and meetings. The Group maintained liaison with the Timor-Leste Defence Force and the International Stabilization Force. 33. UNMIT promoted the mainstreaming of human rights and monitored, reported on and advocated for human rights issues, including economic, social, cultural and human rights. Technical advisers assisted in building the capacity of national actors in the fields of accountability, transitional justice, treaty reporting, sexual and gender-based violence and protection of vulnerable groups.

Following a drawdown period that concluded on 31 December 2012 with the end of the Mission's mandate, the liquidation team is executing a six-month liquidation of UNMIT. With all regional locations closed by 31 December 2012, as well as the Darwin Liaison Office, the liquidation is based in Dili. The liquidation exercise is divided into two phases: the first three months will see the execution of the UNMIT preliminary assets disposal plan and the Mission is to complete the remaining administrative part of the liquidation by June 2013 with a significantly reduced team. The Serious Crimes Investigation Team support staff will remain in the Mission until the end of June 2013. During that period, routine contact with the Government of Timor-Leste will be maintained. 4.1 Effective and efficient completion of the administrative liquidation of the Mission 4.1.1 Completion of site handover records to include environmental certification 4.1.2 Execution of the approved assets disposal plan 4.1.3 Closure of Mission claims, legal issues, procurement and financial activities :: Administration of the liquidation and support team comprising up to 72 international staff, 6 national staff, 15 United Nations Volunteers and up to 169 individual contractors and the Serious Crimes Investigation Team comprising 20 international staff :: Repatriation of 92 international staff and 15 United Nations Volunteers Administrative processes :: Closure of 41 contractual arrangements with vendors :: Settlement of all justified mission financial liabilities, closure of claims and conclusion of legal issues :: Reconciliation, verification and closing of 2 bank accounts Premises maintenance and handover period :: Maintenance and preparation for handover of 8 main premises in 1 location :: Operation and maintenance of 14 generators :: Preparation and shipment of 2,069 non-expendable items at an estimated inventory value of $13,8 million to UNLB and 14 non-expendable items to other missions with large shipments to the United Nations Support Office for the African Union Mission in Somalia, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo :: Conduct of two commercial sales for non-expendable and expendable property :: Execution of the donation package subject to approval by the General Assembly in the estimated inventory value of $4.5 million, consisting of some 1,741 items Communications and information technology :: Maintenance of a satellite link, Internet service provider connectivity and primary Department of Field Support applications :: Provision of information technology and communications client support to a maximum of 150 individual users (inclusive of individual contractors) :: Operation and maintenance of 1 medical facility (level I plus) in 1 location :: Provide support of the United Nations country team medical service memorandum of understanding to provide the necessary medical services for a three-month period :: Maintenance of ability to offer support in medical emergencies :: Provision of security services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for all established compounds and individual residences, and 1 logistics compound The Mission is anticipating the provision by the Government of a large yard for use in the disposal of the UNMIT inventory, including the conduct of a commercial sale.

(Percentage) Actual Budgeted Revised National Professional Officers National General Service staff Temporary positionsa a Funded under general temporary assistance. D. Contingent-owned equipment: major equipment and selfsustainment 47. Requirements for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 are based on standard reimbursement rates for major equipment (wet-lease) and self-sustainment in the total amount of $2,728,000, as follows: Estimated amount Major equipment Self-sustainment Mission factors Effective date Last review date A.

The number of participants planned for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, compared to previous periods, is as follows: (Number of participants) Revised 2012/13 Actual 2011/12 Revised d 2012/13 Internal Externala a Includes UNLB and outside the Mission area. 50. The revised 2012/13 budget proposal reflected an overall decrease in the number of international and national staff to be trained, owing to the drawdown of the Mission and its closure on 31 December 2012. The National Staff Capacity-Building Project, initiated in early 2010 as an essential component of the Mission's transition plan, includes all national staff undertaking training both in the Mission area -- delivered by training staff and consultants -- and outside the area. During the reporting period, the focus was on completion of the project by preparing the national staff to enter the public and private sector after the closure of the Mission. III. Analysis of variances 51. The standard terminology applied with respect to the analysis of resource variances in the present section remains the same as in previous reports. 52. The reduced requirements are attributable to the gradual drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission, which resulted in the repatriation of all military observers. The estimates take into account an average strength of 23 military observers and the repatriation of all military observers, as compared to provisions made in the initial budget for the authorized strength of 34 military observers for the 12-month period with the application of a 2 per cent delayed deployment factor. 53. The reduced requirements are attributable to the gradual drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission, which resulted in repatriation of all United Nations police officers by 31 December 2012. The estimates take into account the average strength of 542 police officers and the repatriation of all 748 United Nations police officers, as compared to provisions made in the initial budget for the authorized strength of 790 United Nations police officers for the 12-month period with the application of a 10 per cent delayed deployment factor. 54. The reduced requirements are attributable to the gradual drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission, which resulted in repatriation of all formed police units by 14 November 2012. The estimates take into account an average strength of 397 and the repatriation of 490 formed police units, as compared to provisions made in the initial budget for the authorized strength of 490 formed police units for the 12-month period with the application of a 3 per cent delayed deployment factor. 55. The decreased requirement is partially offset by an increased requirement for the repatriation of formed police units and freight costs for the contingent-owned equipment that were not initially budgeted. 56. The reduced requirements are attributable to the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. The estimates provide for the maintenance of an average strength of 273 international staff for the period from 1 July to 30 December 2012 and 66 for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2013, and phased repatriation of all international staff, as compared to provisions made in the initial budget for the authorized strength of 352 international staff for the 12-month period, with the application of a 20 per cent vacancy rate. 57. The decreased requirement is partially offset by the requirement for separation costs and termination indemnity for staff members in line with staff rules and regulations, to staff who will not be reassigned to other field missions. 58. The reduced requirements are attributable to the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. The estimates provide for the administration of an average of 57 National Professional Officers and 628 General Service staff for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012 and phased separation of all national staff, as compared to provisions made in the initial budget for the authorized strength of 78 National Professional Officers and 849 General Service staff for the 12-month period, with the application of 25 per cent and 9 per cent delayed recruitment factors, respectively. 59. The decreased requirements are partially offset by the requirement for separation costs and termination indemnities to be paid to staff members in line with staff rules and regulations. 60. The reduced requirements are attributable to the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. The estimates provide for the maintenance and phased repatriation of the average of 162 United Nations Volunteers for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012 and 9 United Nations Volunteers for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2013 and phased repatriation of all Volunteers, as compared to provisions made in the initial budget for the authorized strength of up to 270 Volunteers, with the application of a 10 per cent delayed recruitment factor. 61. The reduced requirements are attributable to the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. The estimates provide for the maintenance and phased drawdown of the average of 11 international staff and 5 national staff temporary positions for the period from 1 July to 30 November 2012, as compared to provisions made in the initial budget for the authorized strength of 6 international and 10 national temporary positions over the four-month period, 11 international staff temporary positions over the six-month period and 2 international and 2 national staff temporary positions over the 12-month period, with the application of 20 per cent and 10 per cent delayed recruitment factors, respectively. 62. The increased requirement is due to the need for non-training consultancy services, including: (a) the undertaking of a survey with regard to United Nations police best practices and lessons learned in the area of institutional development, capacity-building and empowerment of the national police forces and considering future improvements of peacekeeping missions; (b) six consultants to carry out public information functions, including graphic design, communication, editorial services and multimedia production; (c) consultant information management and consulting services for the UNMIT National Capacity-Building Programme. The requirement is partially offset by the reduced requirement for training consultants. 63. The reduced requirement is attributable to the lower requirement for scheduled official travel, owing to the completion of the Mission's mandate and finalization of its substantive activities by 30 November 2012, and to the curtailing of training activities, owing to the closing of the Mission. 64. The decreased requirement is attributable to the gradual drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission by 30 June 2012, which will result in the lower requirement for (a) utilities, rental of office equipment, fuel for generators, commercially provided security services and maintenance and other services, owing to the handover of premises to the appropriate authorities; and (b) reimbursement of troop-contributing Governments for self-sustainment costs, owing to the repatriation of all formed police units by 14 November 2012. 65. The reduced requirement is attributable to the gradual drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission by 30 June 2012, which will result in lower requirements for fuel for vehicles, spare parts, liability insurance and rental of vehicles. The decreased requirement is partially offset by the requirement to provide repair and maintenance of vehicles prior to their disposal by sale or shipment to other missions. 66. The reduced requirements are attributable to the gradual drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission, resulting in the suspension of air operations by 17 December 2012, as compared to the provision for two helicopters for a 12month period and two for the elections in the initial budget. The overall decreased requirement is partially offset by the cost incurred for the rental and operation of one fixed-wing aircraft during the period from 1 July to 15 December 2012, since the bidding exercise for air ambulance services envisaged in the budget was not successful. 67. The reduced requirements are attributable mainly to: (a) the lower reimbursement of troop-contributing Governments for self-sustainment costs, in view of the repatriation of formed police unit personnel by 14 November 2012; (b) the lower requirement for commercial communications and communications spare parts; and (c) reduced public information services, owing to the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. The overall reduced requirement is partially offset by the higher costs of commercial communication, owing to the fixed monthly costs for leasing the satellite transponder. 68. The variance is attributable to the lower requirement for information technology services, licences and fees and spare parts owing to the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. 69. The reduced requirements are attributable to: (a) the lower requirement for medical supplies and services in line with the reduction in staff; and (b) reduced requirements for the reimbursement of troop-contributing Governments for selfsustainment costs, in view of the full repatriation of formed police units by 14 November 2012 in line with the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. 70. The lower requirements are partially offset by the requirement for private air ambulance services in the absence of UNMIT aircraft used for emergency medical evacuations during the liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 2013. 71. The variance is attributable to reduced requirements for the reimbursement of troop-contributing Governments for self-sustainment costs in view of the full repatriation of formed police units by 14 November 2012 in line with the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. 72. The increased requirements are attributable mainly to freight costs for the shipment of personal effects of United Nations police officers in relation to their repatriation and the shipment of United Nations assets; and memorandums of understanding between the Mission and UNDP, UNFPA, UN-Women and UNICEF for the completion of mandated tasks under the integrated strategic framework during the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012 with a view to facilitating a smooth transition and continuing peacebuilding support in Timor-Leste beyond 2012. 73. The overall increased requirement is partially offset by the reduced requirement during the mandate period from 1 July to 31 December 2012 and/or no requirement during the liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 2013 for training fees, supplies and services, external audit, general insurance, official functions and other services in line with the drawdown and subsequent liquidation of the Mission. IV. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 74. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the Mission are: (a) Reduction of the appropriation of $155,429,000 approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/270 for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 by $53,824,100 to $101,604,900, including $89,566,600 for maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012, and $12,038,300 for the administrative liquidation of the Mission from 1 January to 30 June 2013; (b) Taking into account the amount of $78,393,550 already assessed on Member States under the terms of Assembly resolution 66/270 for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012, including $75,002,000 for the maintenance of the Mission, $3,215,950 for the support account and $175,600 for UNLB, and also taking into account the additional amount of $11,590,700 for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2012 and the amount of $13,485,550 for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2013, inclusive of $10,094,000 for the anticipated administrative liquidation of the Mission, subject to a decision by the Security Council, for the period from 1 January to 30 April 2013, $3,215,950 for the support account and $175,600 for UNLB for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2013 assessed pursuant to Assembly resolution 67/245, to assess the additional amount of $4,918,200 gross for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. A. General Assembly Cross-cutting issues (Resolution 66/264) Decisions and requests to the Secretary-General Action taken to implement decisions and requests Notes some recent improvements in the vacancy and turnover rates for civilian staff while recognizing scope for improvement, and therefore requests the Secretary-General to ensure that vacant posts are filled expeditiously (para. 21) UNMIT was challenged with regard to filling international and national vacant posts. International staff were not receptive to reassignment to a closing mission. Further, suitably qualified staff were not present in the local employment market when recruitment to national posts was done Underlines the importance of the Secretary-General comprehensively reviewing the civilian staffing requirements for each peacekeeping mission, with particular attention to the feasibility of nationalizing Field Service posts and improving the ratio of substantive to support staff, in particular when there is a significant change in mandate or authorized force levels, to ensure that the civilian staffing structure is appropriate to effectively implement the current mission mandate and that it reflects staffing best practices across missions (para. 23) In line with the anticipated liquidation of the Mission, the focus is on ensuring a smooth and efficient drawdown of staff Welcomes improvements regarding, inter alia, the physical verification of non-expendable property, and stresses the importance of strengthening the full cycle of supply chain management within peacekeeping operations, and in this regard reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to strengthen internal controls in the management of those assets to ensure adequate safeguards that would prevent waste and financial loss to the Organization (para. 30) The Mission concurs and is in compliance with the recommendation. 100 per cent physical verification of non-expendable property was achieved during the financial years 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12 [...] Requests the Secretary-General to ensure the application of liberty usage guidelines for all mission vehicles and to report thereon in the next overview report on the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (para. 31) Due to inadequate public transportation and the safety issues related to staff travelling in public transport, the Mission had permitted the use of vehicles, assigned to staff, for limited travel to and from residences for shopping, banking and other similar use, limited to 40 kilometres per day. The Mission concurs with the recommendation; however, monitoring of the use of vehicles for the remaining liquidation period may not be possible with the drawdown of staff in the Mission B. Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/66/718) Request Response To facilitate an assessment of the impact of efficiency measures on budget implementation, the Advisory Committee is of the view that, where applicable, in the context of the analysis of variances, budget performance reports should include details of savings resulting from the implementation of efficiency measures (see also para. 23 below) (para. 19) Measures have been taken to reflect the use of appropriate terminology clearly differentiating savings and over/ underexpenditures in variance analysis The Advisory Committee is of the view that, in the preparation of the budget performance reports for the 2011/12 period, a distinction must be made between any savings which derive from the implementation of efficiency measures and underexpenditures resulting from other factors (para. 23) underexpenditures in variance analysis related to efficiency measures and other factors The Advisory Committee welcomes efforts to identify cross-cutting targets for resource reductions and to critically examine proposals for capital expenditures by field missions, and notes the assurance given that the particular circumstances pertaining to each peacekeeping operation were taken into account during budget preparation. The Committee considers, however, that the budget proposals should have provided more information on how those measures are going to be applied by each mission, including, where appropriate, any mitigating measures planned to ensure that there would be no impact on mandate implementation (para. 33) The recommendation has been taken into consideration in the Mission's revised budget for 2012/13, which includes equipment to be transferred to other missions and donated to the Government There were no acquisitions in this period, in line with the Mission's previous years' strategy to reduce asset holdings in preparation for the drawdown phase In this regard, the Advisory Committee also cautions against equating the deferral of capital expenditures with the implementation of sustainable efficiency measures that are based on changes in business processes which enable the more cost-efficient delivery of mandates. The Advisory Committee further expects that careful planning will be undertaken to ensure that any restoration of delayed capital expenditures during the 2012/13 period does not create a significant additional financial burden on Member States in subsequent financial periods (para. 34) Not applicable for UNMIT circumstances The Advisory Committee is of the view that the delayed deployment factors and vacancy rates to be applied should be based on fully justified budgetary assumptions that take into account both historical data and foreseeable factors. In this regard, clear justification should be provided in budget documents for the rates used, particularly when these differ from the actual rates at the time of budget preparation (para. 36) The Mission has not done any recruitment during the 2012/13 period, due to the drawdown and forthcoming liquidation of the Mission The Advisory Committee considers that the human resources management reforms approved by the General Assembly in recent years and the availability of pre-cleared candidates on the roster should result in a demonstrable and sustained reduction in actual vacancy rates for civilian staff throughout peacekeeping operations. The Committee is therefore of the view that this issue should be kept under review in the context of future budget submissions (para. 38) The Mission recruited 137 candidates from the roster in 2011/12; however, the reduced vacancy rate was offset in 2012 by increasing numbers of staff members reassigned to other missions in line with the drawdown and liquidation of the Mission The Advisory Committee is of the view that, in order to provide clarity regarding the basis for the resource requirements being proposed, particularly when missions are deploying or expanding, the information provided to the General Assembly in the context of proposed budgets should include details of the phased deployment schedules of troops and police and their impact on resource requirements (para. 39) The proposed 2012/13 revised budget includes the schedule of the drawdown and repatriation schedules for formed police units and United Nations police in line with the drawdown and liquidation of the Mission The Advisory Committee reiterates its position that the continuing requirement for long-vacant posts should be reviewed on an ongoing basis and, in particular, before requests for new posts are made to the General Assembly (see A/65/743, para. 43, and A/66/7, para. 92). It is not clear to the Committee that such reviews are being systematically undertaken by each peacekeeping operation. In this regard, it is recalled that in the context of the proposed programme budget, the General Assembly, in its resolution 66/246, endorsed the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the continuing need for posts that have been vacant for two years or longer should be rejustified together with an explanation for the vacancy (see A/66/7, paras. 92 and 93). The Committee recommends that a similar requirement apply to posts in peacekeeping operations and that information on posts that have been vacant for two years or longer should be included in mission budget proposals, along with specific justification for any that are proposed for retention (para. 54) By 1 July 2012 all critical vacant posts were filled by selecting suitable candidates from the Field Central Review Board roster. Due to the closure of the Mission, staff continue to be reassigned to other missions. UNMIT is therefore utilizing temporary vacancy announcements and temporary assignments in order ensure that critical posts are encumbered. The Advisory Committee remains concerned at the proportion of peacekeeping training resources that are for training-related travel. The Committee reiterates its position that travel for training should be kept under close review and limited to the extent possible (see A/65/743, para. 135) (para. 74) The Mission closely monitored and restricted travel for training during the 2011/12 budget period, which resulted in savings of US$ 870,300 (43.6 per cent of the approved appropriation), with an actual higher number of national staff trained than budgeted. Emphasis was also placed on in-house training, and training within the region, which contributed to the savings The Committee recommends that in future reports on benefits and cost savings, further effort be made to gather and provide reliable supporting information to enable the cause and effect relationships between actions taken and any reported benefits or savings being reported to be clearly demonstrated. The Committee notes that reporting on the evaluation of the impact of efficiency measures on mandate and service delivery remains deficient at this stage (see also para. 33 above) (para. 86) The impact of the efficiency measures on mandate and service is noted in the performance report for 2011/12 The Advisory Committee recommends that the Secretary-General be requested to review vehicle and information technology equipment holdings in peacekeeping operations and to align such holdings with the standard ratios established by the Department of Field Support and promulgated in the Standard Cost and Ratio Manual. The Committee requests that information in that regard be provided in the context of the next overview report. The Committee recognizes that mission-specific operational circumstances may exist that justify holdings in excess of the standard ratios and requests that, where applicable, such justification be clearly outlined in the 2013/14 budget proposals for the missions concerned (para. 91) As the Mission started its drawdown in October 2012 and liquidation in January 2013, all assets are to be removed from the Mission in line with the liquidation plan, and reported to the General Assembly through the disposition of assets report The Committee is of the view that the holdings of information technology equipment by peacekeeping operations should also be based on planned deployment levels of personnel for the period concerned or, if higher, on actual deployment in the mission, rather than on the full authorized level of personnel (para. 92) The Mission's unit stock assets are expected to be higher due to staff checking out and the short-duration surge in staff brought in for the elections. The assets were returned to the stock and are subject to disposal action in line with the Mission staff drawdown plan The Committee is of the view that Rotation Coordinators provide a valuable service to troop- and police-contributing countries and expects that the Secretary-General will seek to identify the resources necessary to ensure their use (para. 102) The Mission fully implemented the recommendation by sending Flight Coordinators during all four of its formed police units rotation to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Portugal and Malaysia during the 2011/12 period. In addition, support was rendered to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for all its rotations in Asia and the South-East Asian region by sending Flight Coordinators from UNMIT for MINUSTAH to the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Indonesia during the 2011/12 period The Committee ... requests that future budget proposals for peacekeeping operations include specific information on all construction projects for which resources of more than $1 million are sought for the financial period in question (para. 106) There were no construction projects of over $1 million in the Mission The Advisory Committee notes the actions taken to transfer vehicles between missions to meet emerging requirements but remains of the view that a further review of the vehicle holdings of peacekeeping missions is required (para. 110) The Mission, in consultation with the Headquarters Surface Transport Section, formulated a preliminary assets disposal plan to dispose of vehicles and other assets in line with United Nations policy on property management which also includes the transfer of vehicles in good condition to other missions The Committee recognizes that operational developments may, on occasion, lead to additional requirements for travel. The Committee is concerned, however, about the level of overexpenditure on travel reported for the 2010/11 period. The Committee stresses the importance that travel requirements be properly budgeted and that every effort be made to ensure that travel expenditures remain within approved provisions (para. 137) The Mission concurs with the recommendation of the Advisory Committee and during the 2011/2012 budget period, applied control measures. Official travels were limited to mandatory and essential conferences, and meetings, resulting in a saving of $602,900 (21.5 per cent of the approved appropriation) The Committee notes the reduction in the provision for official travel but is of the view that requirements in this area should continue to be kept under close review. While the Committee accepts that the effective delivery of mandates necessitates travel, it is concerned about the disruption of the day-to-day work of staff and the possible impact on programme delivery of prolonged absences from duty stations (see also A/66/739, paras. 3 and 26). As such, the Committee considers that maximum use should be made of advances in information and communications technology and other methods of representation to reduce the need for travel. The Committee has also raised particular concerns about the level of training-related travel being undertaken (para. 138) The Mission closely monitored and restricted travel for training during the 2011/12 budget period resulting in savings of $870,300 (43.6 per cent of the approved appropriation) with an actual higher number of national staff trained than budgeted, due to the emphasis that was also placed on in-house training and training within the region, which contributed to the savings (A/66/718/Add. 8) The Advisory Committee expects that every effort will be made to settle the outstanding claims for police costs and for contingent-owned equipment as soon as possible (para. 11) All pending death and disability claims have been settled. There are no pending death and disability claims. Claims for formed police units were paid up to October 2011. As at 31 December 2012, an estimated $6.8 million was owed for formed police unit reimbursement. All contingent-owned equipment claims were certified up to December 2012 and paid up to June 2011. As at 31 December 2012, an estimated $7.7 million was owed for contingent-owned equipment reimbursement While recognizing the challenge of attracting new staff owing to the anticipated closing of UNMIT, the Advisory Committee urges the Mission to intensify its efforts to fill the vacant posts (para. 13) The Mission was planning to recruit for all identified critical posts in order to successfully carry out all functions stipulated in the mandate. In order to facilitate that strategy, all critical vacant posts were filled by selecting suitable candidates from the Field Central Review Board roster up until June 2012. In line with the drawdown and liquidation of the Mission, all critical posts will be filled via temporary vacancy announcements and temporary assignments as and if required The Advisory Committee recognizes that the isolated geographical location of UNMIT is an impediment to the transfer of surplus vehicles and information technology equipment to other missions. The Committee also recognizes the fact that the majority of the peacekeeping missions require left-hand drive vehicles, which limits the transferability of UNMIT right-hand drive vehicles. Nonetheless, the Committee encourages the Mission to consider other measures to reduce the surplus assets, including disposal by sale on the local market, in order to limit their operating costs (para. 39) The Mission, in consultation with the Surface Transport Section, formulated a preliminary assets disposal plan to identify vehicles for transfer to UNLB and/or other missions which require right-hand drive vehicles and other disposal means, inclusive of commercial sale and potential donation to the Government in line with the Committee's recommendation Over the past three years, the Mission has reduced the levels of purchased/replacement equipment and infrastructure upgrading. As a consequence, the age profile of CITS asset holdings currently within the Mission reflects high percentages of technically obsolete equipment and equipment well past normal replacement life expectancy. As such, the strategy has minimized the volume of equipment that might ordinarily be attractive propositions for other missions. Assets that are in reasonable condition and suitable for donation to the host Government have been identified and the process of formalizing acceptance/transfer is under way. In-country-based United Nations agencies and programmes have also been approached with a view to establishing interest in acquiring any of the Mission's assets. Furthermore the liquidation of mission assets is being carried out in line with the United Nations policy on property management Recalling the recommendation of the Board of Auditors for all active missions to develop liquidation plans soon after their inception (A/66/5 (Vol. II), para. 181), the Advisory Committee notes the proactive stance taken by UNMIT in formulating a liquidation strategy and encourages the Mission to draw lessons from the experience of other recently liquidated missions in the implementation of its strategy (para. 47) The Mission entered into liquidation on 1 January 2013. The final draft of the liquidation plan to support the six-month liquidation period is complete (A/65/5 (Vol. II)) Recommendation Implementation Lack of full justification for budget assumptions The Board noted other cases of inappropriate use of delayed deployment factor rates for the formulation of budgets relating to [...] National Professional Officer at UNMIS and UNMIT [...] (para. 31) The Mission prepares the budget based on the Mission's planning assumptions and historical costs to ensure accuracy of cost estimates for resource requirements. For the 2012/13 budget, due to the drawdown and liquidation of the Mission, the delayed deployment factor is not applicable The Board recommends that the Administration require field missions to: (a) maintain complete and accurate historical records for various activities and take those records into account when preparing the future years' budgets; (b) apply an appropriate computation method when calculating the resource requirements to better reflect the reality on the ground; and (c) use delayed deployment factors consistently and accurately in various categories of the contingent-owned equipment self-sustainment budget (para. 41) The Board also recommends that field missions and Headquarters implement more stringent reviews of the budget submissions to ensure that they are applied in a consistent, accurate and appropriate manner (para. 42) The Mission, in line with improving budget submissions, designated focal points to work directly with section chiefs/unit supervisors and cost centre managers to collect, verify and draft the budget elements. However, all budget submissions were vetted through the pillar heads concerned prior to being submitted to the Acting Special Representative of the Secretary-General for approval Insufficient coverage of physical count on expendable property The coverage of physical count on expendable property at UNMIS, UNLB and UNSOA was inadequate, and the records at UNMIT were inaccurate. [...] In addition, the Board found at UNMIT that the quantity of nine category drugs recorded in the Galileo system (representing 82 per cent of all drugs held) was inconsistent with the verification by the Board (para. 72) The Mission has already implemented annual and random stocktaking by all Self-Accounting Units, monitored through quarterly spot checks by the Office of the Chief of Integrated Support Services, to ensure accuracy of data maintained in the Galileo system With new procedures of stocktaking and inventory management in place, the Mission has improved data accuracy and has achieved 98.30 per cent stocktaking as at 30 June 2012 and is determined to achieve 100 per cent by 31 December 2012 The Board recommends that the Department of Field Support require missions to conduct a physical count of expendable property periodically and enhance the coverage of the physical count to obtain the assurance of the accuracy of the data recorded in the Galileo system (para. 73) Deficiencies in write-off and disposal of non-expendable property and expendable property During this year's audit, the Board found efficiencies in the process of write-off and disposal as follows: ... (b) Write-off or disposal without approval. The Board noted that in UNMIT, 1,919 items of not-found expendable property valued at $28,740 were directly written off by warehouse employees without approval from the Chief Administrative Officer. This indicates insufficient internal control over expendable property, increasing the risk of loss, fraud and misappropriation (para. 85) The Mission concurs and is in compliance with the recommendation. Self-accounting units are required to initiate write-off of the property not found during the stocktaking and the write-off is approved by the Chief of Mission Support only subsequent to the investigation and review by the Local Property Survey Board. Moreover, during the financial year 2011/12, the Mission took steps to identify delay factors in the write-off and disposal process, which resulted in assets being written off and disposed of within the time frame established by the Director of Field Support. The Board reiterates its previous recommendation that the Department of Field Support strengthen the monitoring of the write-off and disposal of assets at missions to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to expedite all pending write-off or disposal cases (para. 86). The Board further recommends that the Administration: (a) ascertain the causes of the delays with a view to streamlining the process; and (b) ensure that missions strictly comply with the approval procedure for write-off and disposal (para. 87) Vendor performance evaluation Regular monitoring and reporting on vendor performance with appropriate action taken where necessary is important to securing best value for money from procurement. The Board, however, identified the following weaknesses: (a) Use of inconsistent performance criteria. At UNMIT, vendor A got a negative evaluation for delivery performance due to a delay of 107 days, 95 days and 22 days in three purchase orders. Despite that performance, the vendor received an overall "acceptable" performance evaluation. Similarly, vendor B got a negative evaluation regarding the delivery performance due to 111 days and 18 days of delay in two purchase orders, but was rejected in the final performance report. The Board could find no justification for the difference in vendor performance evaluation. The criteria for vendor performance evaluation need to be made clearer and consistently applied, otherwise they will adversely impact the execution of contracts The Mission has issued a standard operating procedure for expediting vendor performance management and application of liquidated damages for supply of goods The Mission has issued a standard operating procedure dated 30 January 2012 for expediting vendor performance management and application of liquidated damages for supply of goods The Board recommends that the Department of Field Support require UNMIT to establish standard operating procedures to ensure consistent criteria to be applied in the vendors' performance evaluation (para. 108) The Board further recommends that the Department of Field Support systematically strengthen the procedures applied by missions in the management of vendors' performance at missions (para. 109) The Department of Field Support commented that UNMIT was developing a standard operating procedure to ensure that consistent criteria would be applied in vendors' performance evaluations. It would be issued during the first quarter of 2012 (para. 110) The Board acknowledged the efforts by the Department of Field Support and missions to reduce the recruitment lead time compared to the previous financial year in most missions. However, the Board noted that: :: In some missions, there was still a gap between the actual lead time and the targeted time of 120 days set by the Secretary-General in his report (A/55/253). For example, for international staff in UNMIT, the average lead time of recruitment was 263 days, with the longest being 1,509 days. Similar observations were noted in UNLB and UNIFIL (para. 126) The recommendation is not applicable in the liquidating Mission. The UNMIT Human Resources Section made every effort to reduce the recruitment lead time to 120 days by following up on medical clearance for staff and encouraging new staff to travel with their national passports, as opposed to laissez-passer, when possible. The recruitment lead time during the period starting in July 2012 was 90 to 120 days Recruitment of national staff and consultants The Board noted instances where UNMIT maintained the files only for the final selected candidates. The relative documents for those failed candidates have not been found. In some cases, there were no supporting documents in respect of written test results, interview or contract records with the candidates (para. 131) The Mission addressed this observation and has implemented procedures to ensure that all recruitment files are correctly maintained as advised by the Board of Auditors in its report covering the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. In its report for the financial period 2011/12, the Board of Auditors recognized this improvement The Board recommends that the Department of Field Support enhance the selection and management of consultants/individual contractors by strictly complying with related requirement policies to make the whole process more competitive, transparent and well-documented (para. 134) The Mission developed local Standard Operating Procedures in line with administrative instruction ST/AI/1999/7 and also advertised opportunities on external websites, such as Web-Relief, to ensure that the recruitment of consultants/individual contractors was conducted in a transparent, competitive and well-documented manner Annex I A.
