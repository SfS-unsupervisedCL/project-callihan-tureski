that, despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase, Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications, including the Internet, continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world, Aware that racism, being one of the exclusionist phenomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Calling for the promotion of tolerance and respect for cultural diversity as an important factor, among others, in eliminating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Recalling General Assembly resolution 48/91 of 20 December 1993, in which the Assembly

violent forms, Stressing the need to recognize that acts of violence motivated by racial discrimination and xenophobia are crimes punishable by law, Stressing also the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Acknowledging that indigenous people and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities are at times vulnerable to particular forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Noting with concern the existence of multiple discrimination, in particular against women, Recognizing that failure, especially by public authorities and politicians, to combat racial discrimination and xenophobia is a factor encouraging their perpetuation in society, I.

Notes with concern the persistence of the external debt problem, that the vicious cycle of debt and underdevelopment has become further entrenched, that debt service has grown at a much greater rate than the debt itself and that the burden of payments has become heavier in many developing countries, including those with low and middle incomes, despite repeated rescheduling, and that the current debt and poverty reduction and growth initiatives lack sufficient funding and have several conditions attached; Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twentyfourth special session, annexed to resolution S24/2, of 1 July 2000 to find effective, equitable, developmentoriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debtservicing burdens of developing countries; 5. Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based, inter alia, in open, equitable, secure, nondiscriminatory, predictable, transparent and multilateral rulebased international financial and trading systems, which guarantees the developing countries, inter alia, better market conditions and commodity prices, stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates, easier access to financial and capital markets, adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries; 6.

Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment polices, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 8. Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt, in particular in the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms, to be extended, expedited, implemented completely and made more flexible, and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives, which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis; 9. Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 10. Requests the independent expert to present an analytical report to the Commission, on an annual basis, on the implementation of the present resolution, paying particular attention to: (a) The effects of the foreign debt and the policies adopted to face them on the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular, economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries; (b) Measures taken by Governments, the private sector and international financial institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries; (c) New developments, actions and initiatives being taken by international financial institutions, other United Nations bodies and intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations with respect to structural adjustment policies and human rights; 11.

Also calls upon Governments, international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries, giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters; 16. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 17. Recognizes that there is a need for more transparency, participation by all States and consideration of the relevant resolutions of the Commission in the deliberations and activities of international and regional financial institutions; 18.

Human rights and extreme poverty Recalling that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his or her civil and political rights, Recalling in particular that article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and wellbeing of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control, Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty, including its most persistent forms, and the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals, Deeply concerned that, 53fifty-three years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and manifestations, such as hunger, disease, lack of adequate shelter, illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries, while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world, Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.157/23) adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, Recalling in particular that the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed that least developed countries committed to the process of democratization and economic reforms, many of which are in Africa, should be supported by the international community in order to succeed in their transition to democracy and economic development, Bearing in mind the commitments reaffirmed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, particularly to spare no effort to fight against extreme poverty, Recalling General Assembly resolution 50/107 of 20 December 1995, in which the Assembly proclaimed the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (19972006), and noting the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Decade (A/55/407), Recalling also General Assembly resolution 53/146 of 9 December 1998, on human rights and extreme poverty, in which the Assembly recalled that the mandate of the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty should include continuing to take into account the efforts of the poorest people themselves and the conditions in which they could convey their experiences, Recalling further the Declaration of the Microcredit Summit, held in Washington, D.C., in February 1997, which launched a global campaign to reach one hundred million of the world's poorest families, especially women, with credit for self-employment by the year 2005, Stressing that, in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development held in March 1995 (A/CONF.166/9, chap.

Invites the Sub-Commission in particular: (a) To devote sufficient time at its fifty-third session, principally in closed session, to the discussion and adoption of its working methods and timetable, so as to avoid prolonged procedural debates in public meetings; (b) To reserve time to meet in closed session for the preliminary discussion of reports and working papers, for example by holding question-and-answer sessions; (c) To propose further measures to improve the functioning of the Sub-Commission, including the further streamlining of its agenda; 8. Requests States: (a) When nominating and electing members and alternates to the Sub-Commission, to be conscious of the strong concern to ensure that the body is independent and is seen to be so; (b) When nominating and electing members and alternates to the Sub-Commission, to keep in mind the need for a balanced accommodation of the benefits of continuity and the importance of renewal; (c) When nominating candidates for the Sub-Commission, to submit nominations, if possible, at least two months prior to the beginning of the session at which they will be elected, so as to enable the members of the Commission thoroughly to assess the qualifications and the independence of the nominees; 9. Invites the Secretary-General to give support to the Sub-Commission, inter alia by making available documentation in a timely fashion before each session in the official languages of the United Nations and assisting the Sub-Commission with regard to requests for information from Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, but to consider such requests only after they have been approved by the Commission; 10.

Invites the Chairperson of the fifty-third session of the Sub-Commission to report to the Commission at its fifty-eighth session, including an assessment of how recent enhancements of the effectiveness of the Sub-Commission and of its mechanisms have worked in practice; 13. Decides to consider the issue of the work of the Sub-Commission again at its fifty-eighth session under the relevant agenda item. [Adopted without a vote. See chap. XVI.] 2001/61. United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education (1995-2004) Guided by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Reaffirming article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in accordance with which education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, Recalling the provisions of other international human rights instruments, including article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which reflect the aims of the aforementioned article, Taking into account its resolution 1993/56 of 9 March 1993, in which the Commission recommended that knowledge of human rights, both in its theoretical dimension and in its practical application, should be established as a priority in education policies, Believing that every woman, man and child, to realize their full human potential, must be made aware of all their human rights, civil, cultural, economic, political and social, Believing also that human rights education constitutes an important vehicle for the elimination of gender-based discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities through the promotion and protection of the human rights of women, Convinced that human rights education should involve more than the provision of information and should constitute a comprehensive lifelong process by which people at all levels of development and in all societies learn respect for the dignity of others and the means and methods of ensuring that respect in all societies, Convinced also that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children, youth, older persons, indigenous people, minorities, rural and urban poor, migrant workers, refugees, persons with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome infection and disabled persons, Recognizing the role of education in constructing a culture of peace, in particular the teaching of the practice of non-violence, which will promote the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, Bearing in mind that 2001 is the sixth year of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and the first year of the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and NonViolence for the Children of the World, and that their harmonization will enhance the advancement of human rights, Welcoming the holding of the expert seminar on human rights and peace organized by the University for Peace and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva on 8 and 9 December 2000 as part of the activities in celebration of Human Rights Day on 11 December 2000 and guided by the broad theme of "human rights education", Bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), in particular Part II, paragraphs 78 to 82, thereof, Recalling the responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to coordinate relevant United Nations education and public information programmes in the field of human rights, Recalling also General Assembly resolution 49/184 of 23 December 1994, in which the Assembly proclaimed the ten-year period beginning on 1 January 1995 the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, welcomed the Plan of Action for the Decade (A/51/506/Add.1, appendix) and requested the High Commissioner to coordinate the implementation of the Plan of Action, Noting General Assembly resolution 55/94 of 4 December 2000, in which the Assembly urged all Governments to contribute further to the implementation of the Plan of Action, in particular by encouraging the establishment, in accordance with national conditions, of broadly representative national committees for human rights education responsible for the development of comprehensive, effective and sustainable national plans of action for human rights education and information, taking into consideration the relevant guidelines developed by the Office of the High Commissioner, Bearing in mind that, according to the Plan of Action, during the year 2000 a mid-term global evaluation of progress made towards the achievement of the objectives of the Decade was to be undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner, in cooperation with all other principal actors of the Decade, and that the High Commissioner was to report to the General Assembly on the results of the evaluation, Recalling that the Commission, in its resolution 2000/71 of 26 April 2000, requested the Secretary-General, through the High Commissioner, to submit to the Commission, at its fiftyseventh session the recommendations of the mid-term evaluation report, 1. Acknowledges with appreciation the process of the mid-term global evaluation of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education undertaken from April to August 2000 by the Office of the High Commissioner, which included the launching of a worldwide survey, the organization of an on-line forum, the convening of an expert meeting and the preparation of the High Commissioner's mid-term global evaluation report (A/55/360); 2. Takes note with appreciation of the mid-term global evaluation report of the High Commissioner, which includes an analysis of available information on progress made in the first five years of the Decade at the national, regional and international levels and recommendations for action during the remaining years of the Decade; 3. Invites Governments and other Decade actors to consider disseminating widely the recommendations contained in the mid-term global evaluation report, which are annexed to the present resolution, and to take them into account in furthering their human rights education activities during the remaining years of the Decade; 4. Invites Governments and intergovernmental organizations to provide information, as appropriate, to the High Commissioner on steps taken to implement the recommendations of the mid-term global evaluation report; 5. Requests the High Commissioner to bring the recommendations of the mid-term global evaluation report and the present resolution to the attention of all members of the international community and of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations 77th meeting 25 April 2001 [Adopted without a vote. See chap. XVII.] Annex Recommendations of the mid-term global evaluation of the progress made towards the achievement of the objectives of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education (1995-2004)* 1. The following main findings of the mid-term global evaluation provide the basis for the following recommendations: (a) Obligations of States. States Members of the United Nations have unanimously proclaimed the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, thereby making commitments relating to human rights education, as set out in General Assembly resolution 49/184 of 23 December 1994. Prior to the Decade, Member States had ratified human rights treaties which contained provisions on human rights education, thereby setting themselves treaty obligations with regard to education in general and human rights education in particular. The evaluation, however, reveals that effective national strategies for human rights education have very rarely been developed; (b) United Nations system. The United Nations system has yet to adopt a systemwide response to the Decade, even though the United Nations reforms currently under way call for a system-wide mainstreaming of human rights in all United Nations activities, from needs and country assessment to priority-setting, programming, monitoring and evaluation; (c) National and local actors. National and local actors have contributed greatly towards the achievement of the goals and objectives of the Decade. As indicated above, the Decade has been a catalyst in eliciting a response from Governments but the response has been uneven and clearly much more needs to be done. Both the United Nations and its Member States have repeatedly recognized the invaluable contribution of nongovernmental organizations to human rights education. The present review reconfirms that non-governmental organizations are key actors in that field, and that the Decade is slowly but increasingly proving to be a catalyst and an umbrella for their efforts. There is a growing need, however, for increased collaboration and coordination between governmental and non-governmental actors in respect of their human rights education activities; (d) Regional cooperation. The importance of regional and sub-regional approaches is clearly reflected in the work of non-governmental actors at those levels. The present review, however, indicates that while there are well-established intergovernmental regional structures, both within and outside the United Nations, the potential of such structures to contribute to the realization of the goals of the Decade remains largely unfulfilled; (e) Monitoring, implementation and evaluation. Despite the considerable efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is clear from the experience of the first five years of the Decade that monitoring and evaluation of the Decade need to be strengthened at all levels (international, regional, sub-regional, national and local) and by all actors (intergovernmental, governmental and non-governmental alike); Resources. An enormous gap remains between the commitments and obligations made in connection with the Decade, the expectations raised, and the resources actually committed at every level. This gap must be filled as a matter of urgency, if the remaining years of the Decade are to leave a strong foundation of achievement for subsequent work which will truly meet the needs of all for human rights education. Sustainability of activities beyond the Decade is a crucial issue since, as the Decade itself clearly demonstrates, human rights education is indeed a lifelong process. A. Overall recommendations 2. Overall recommendations directed at all principal actors and for implementation at all levels are set out below. Human rights education: concepts and methods 3. Value-oriented human rights education alone is insufficient. Human rights education should make reference to human rights instruments and mechanisms of protection, and to procedures for ensuring accountability. 4. Creative participatory teaching methods that are relevant to peoples' lives should be used, and human rights should be introduced as a holistic framework. 5. Gender sensitivity should be emphasized in all educational activities. 6. An enabling environment for human rights educators (including the provision of information, training, facilities, equipment and protection from harassment) should be ensured. 7. Priority should be given to sustainable approaches (i.e., training of trainers, integration of human rights into all relevant training and educational curricula etc.). Content of human rights education 8. Activities for human rights education should address the following issues: (a) Economic, social and cultural rights; (b) Good governance; (c) Impunity, and international criminal tribunals to deal with crimes against humanity; (d) Human rights defenders (and the related United Nations declaration), racism and discrimination. 9. The link between development and human rights should be stressed. 10. The universality and indivisibility of human rights should be emphasized. Programmes on human rights education 11. Sufficient attention should be paid to ensure that the human rights education needs of children and young people, as well as of adults, are met. 12. Interaction among children and youth belonging to different ethnic communities should be promoted. Human rights education should be fostered within and outside school curricula. 13. Human rights education should be promoted in all educational initiatives aimed at adults. (a) Local government officials, community leaders (both secular and religious); (b) Legal and paralegal service providers; (c) Rural populations and illiterate people; (d) Women and girls; (e) Vulnerable groups, such as people with human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), people with disabilities, minorities and the elderly; (f) Non-state actors, such as multinational corporations, trade and financial organizations (World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Monetary Fund etc.). 15. The utilization of the Decade for Human Rights Education for mobilization and the establishment of partnerships should be increased. Evaluation, research and monitoring 16. Evaluation and studies and research of long-term impact should be undertaken in order to better understand which approaches work best and why, and in order to elaborate evaluation criteria. Every project on human rights education should incorporate the development of indicators to evaluate qualitative impact. Mass media and freedom of information 17. Mass media strategies that would effectively promote human rights should be developed. Such strategies might include the following elements: (a) Media focus on human rights monitoring; (b) Increasing the use of the media by non-governmental organizations; (c) Training of media professionals on mechanisms for human rights protection; (d) Involvement of the community of artists; (e) Use by the media, when appropriate, of techniques of social marketing. 18. Law reform, policies and practices that improve access to information and strengthen mechanisms that facilitate the flow of information and freedom of the press and other media should be promoted and implemented more vigorously. Human rights education should focus on such law reform policies and practices. 19. The possibilities offered by new information technologies in furthering human rights education should be better exploited, and access to such technologies should be increased. Existing programmes supporting the online development of projects on human rights education should be strengthened and new programmes implemented. Resources 20. Good practices for human rights education should be identified, compiled and disseminated. 21. Organizational capacity-building in human rights education should be fostered. 22. Funding for human rights education should be increased. 23. Research on issues related to human rights education should be enhanced in academic institutions and human rights institutes. 24. When appropriate, alliances with the business sector should be developed in support of human rights education. B. National level 25. Governments should reaffirm the commitments and obligations that they have already made in respect of human rights education and accelerate their pace of implementation so as to realize significant achievements by the end of the Decade. 26. Governments should promote the development of national strategies for human rights education which are comprehensive (in terms of outreach), participatory (in terms of involvement of all relevant actors), effective (in terms of educational methodologies) and sustainable (over the long term). Such strategies could be embodied in a national plan of action for human rights education (the relevant United Nations guidelines provide guidance in this regard). 27. Human rights education should be included as a component of national development plans and of other relevant national plans of action (general plans of action on human rights or those relating to women, children, minorities, indigenous peoples, etc.). 28. All governmental and non-governmental actors should recognize, in a spirit of mutual respect, each other's potential and capacities in furthering human rights education. Partnerships should be established where cooperation (rather than co-option) is furthered. Maximum use should be made of existing programmes, materials and resources. 29. Systems for better coordination of effort and greater cooperation among the various governmental agencies should be developed. 30. Non-governmental organizations should develop and implement strategies to encourage Governments to fulfil their obligations to integrate human rights education into all forms and levels of education for children, youth and adults, and should monitor those strategies. 31. International resources and materials should be adapted to local linguistic and cultural contexts. C. Regional level 32. Key regional human rights education organizations, institutions, agencies and networks should be supported (or, if necessary, established) to develop further the human rights education capacity within regions, including support for regional meetings, training of trainers, on-line networking and sharing of region-specific materials. 33. Region-specific programmes or coordination systems to maximize the participation of national entities (whether governmental or non-governmental) in programmes on human rights education should be developed. Such region-specific programmes can be linked to existing regional programmes supported by the United Nations. 34. Strategies should be developed for the wider distribution of materials on human rights education through regional networks. 35. Links should be established with regional mass media, social development and other groups to encourage the inclusion of human rights in their training programmes. 36. Existing regional intergovernmental organizations should be encouraged to integrate human rights education into their programmes and to allocate additional resources in that regard within the framework of the Decade. 37. Work with regional, education-related intergovernmental organizations should be enhanced in order to promote human rights education. D. International level 38. United Nations institutions should adopt a system-wide approach to the Decade. An effective coordination system should be developed and the role of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in such a system should be strengthened. 39. Effective human rights training should be undertaken for all United Nations staff. 40. Human rights education should be included in the agenda of the special session of the General Assembly on the follow-up to the World Summit for Children, to be held in 2001. 41. The Office of the High Commissioner, as requested by the General Assembly, should monitor the developments in human rights education that take place during the Decade. In this regard, Governments should provide adequate means to enable the Office to fulfil that role. 42. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, through its network of national commissions, should play an active part in encouraging Governments to develop human rights curricula for formal education and to take steps to ensure that school environments are conducive to human rights education. 43. United Nations treaty bodies should emphasize the obligations of States parties with regard to human rights education by actively seeking detailed information during their review of the reports of State parties. Inadequacies in addressing priority target audiences should consistently be identified by treaty bodies as an area of concern. In addition, treaty bodies should perform a clearing-house role by sharing with Governments approaches and strategies that have proven successful elsewhere, and should keep the Office of the High Commissioner informed of major national developments in human rights education. 44. The capacity for human rights education of national presences of intergovernmental organizations (United Nations resident coordinators, field presences of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations information centres, national and local offices of United Nations agencies, etc.) should be strengthened so that they can provide technical support to national and local activities for human rights education. 45. Intergovernmental organizations should facilitate collaboration between governmental institutions and nongovernmental organizations at the national level. 46. Educational materials developed by international organizations should be made easily accessible, distributed free of charge and translated into local languages. 47. The potential support and contribution to human rights education by non-State actors, including the business community, as well as development, trade and financial organizations, should be explored. 2001/62. Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment Reaffirming that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow Recalling that freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a non-derogable right and that the prohibition of torture is explicitly affirmed in article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as well as in the relevant provisions of other international human rights instruments such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of victims of war, and in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Recalling also the definition of torture contained in article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Appalled at the widespread occurrence of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Recalling all relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Commission on Human Rights, in particular Assembly resolution 51/86 of 12 December 1996 and Commission resolution 2000/43 of 20 April 2000 and taking note of Assembly resolution 55/89 of 4 December 2000, Mindful of the proclamation by the General Assembly, in its resolution 52/149 of 12 December 1997, of 26 June as United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, Commending the persistent efforts by non-governmental organizations to combat torture and to alleviate the suffering of victims of torture, Emphasizing the importance of Governments taking persistent action to prevent and combat torture and commending those Governments which cooperate with non-governmental organizations in this respect, 1.

Condemns in particular any action or attempt by States or public officials to legalize or authorize torture under any circumstances, including through judicial decisions, and notes the work of the Special Rapporteur in this regard; 4. Urges all Governments to promote the speedy and full implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), in particular Part II, section B.5, relating to freedom from torture, in which it is stated that States should abrogate legislation leading to impunity for those responsible for grave violations of human rights such as torture and prosecute such violations, thereby providing a firm basis for the rule of law; 5. Reminds Governments that corporal punishment, including of children, can amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or even to torture; 6. Stresses in particular that all allegations of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment should be promptly and impartially examined by the competent national authority, that those who encourage, order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture must be held responsible and severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act is found to have taken place, and that national legal systems should ensure that the victims of such acts obtain redress and are awarded fair and adequate compensation and receive appropriate socio-medical rehabilitation; 7. Notes the Principles on the effective investigation and documentation of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment annexed to Commission resolution 2000/43 and General Assembly resolution 55/89, and encourages Governments to reflect upon the Principles, as a useful tool in efforts to combat torture, and requests the Special Rapporteur, in the normal course of his work, to solicit views from Governments and non-governmental organizations; 8. Calls upon all Governments to take appropriate effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and prohibit the production, trade, export and use of equipment which is specifically designed to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; 9. Requests the Special Rapporteur to study the situation of trade and production in such equipment, its origin, destination and forms, with a view to finding the best ways to prohibit such trade and production and to combat its proliferation, and to report thereon to the Commission; 10. Reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention may facilitate the perpetration of torture and can in itself constitute a form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and the dignity of the person; Calls upon all Governments, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations bodies and agencies, as well as relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to commemorate on 26 June the United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture; 12.

Concluding remarks were also made by the representatives of the Russian Federation and the United States of America. 54. During the consideration of agenda item 3, the Chairperson made a statement, the text of which reads as follows: "Situation of human rights in Colombia "1. The Commission on Human Rights takes note of the willingness of the Government of Colombia to allow the office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to carry out its mandate and conduct its activities without any impediments. The Commission also notes the obstacles which the office has experienced in maintaining a fluid and effective dialogue with the Government on a constant and uniform basis, as well as the commitment of the Government to intensify this dialogue and work together with the office, granting it all the necessary security guarantees. The Commission urges the Government to further strengthen its efforts actively to cooperate with the office to realize the full potential of its mandate. It welcomes the analytical report of the High Commissioner on the situation of human rights in Colombia (E/CN.4/2001/15) and takes note of a document containing the observations of the Government of Colombia on that report (E/CN.4/2001/139). "2. The Commission firmly supports the agreement between the Government of Colombia and the High Commissioner to extend the mandate of the permanent office in Bogotá until April 2002. The Commission continues to consider that the office, which is mandated to promote and protect human rights and observe violations of human rights in the country, as well as to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes, plays a vital role in the work against ongoing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Colombia. The Commission reaffirms its belief that a wider presence of the office is of utmost importance in this work and encourages the opening of field offices in Colombia. "3. Though progress in certain areas is to be acknowledged, the Commission strongly believes that the Government of Colombia has to take further and more effective measures to follow up and fully implement the recommendations of the office. The Commission urges the Government to undertake decisive steps to ensure the fulfilment of these recommendations. The Commission believes that further "4. The Commission expresses its strong support for the peace process in Colombia and notes progress in the negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). The Commission further expresses its support for the efforts made to turn the peace process into a State policy. The Commission welcomes the parties' decision to involve the international community more directly in the negotiations and greatly encourages further efforts to ensure the active involvement of the civil society in the peace process. The Commission reiterates its deep concern about the lack of a permanent ceasefire and about the grave and persistent abuses of international humanitarian law, mainly by "paramilitaries" (also known as "selfdefence groups" or "autodefensas") and guerrillas, which obstruct progress in the peace process. It calls upon all parties to respect international humanitarian law and, in particular, to protect the civilian population. "5. Considering that respect for human rights and the observance of international humanitarian law plays a key role in the process towards a sustainable peace, the Commission calls on the parties to the conflict to reach, as a priority, a comprehensive human rights and humanitarian agreement, faithfully reflecting all provisions of applicable law, including an independent mechanism of verification, as well as to address the question of how victims of the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law can be acknowledged. The Commission notes that the Government of Colombia, through its Office of the High Commissioner for Peace, has stated that it is willing to discuss specific terms of the proposal for such an agreement with the office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in order to make an independent evaluation of its relevance, timing and effectiveness, in the context of the dialogue with the insurgent groups. "6. The Commission strongly deplores the persistence of serious and frequent violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law. In particular, it condemns in unequivocal terms the serious, massive and systematic abuses and grave breaches of international humanitarian law perpetrated by paramilitary and guerrilla groups. The Commission is deeply concerned that these violations and abuses have led to a further deterioration of the human rights and humanitarian situation in Colombia. It further condemns all attacks on objects serving a medical purpose, including threats directed at medical personnel, control of health facilities and attacks on ambulance vehicles. "7. The Commission also strongly deplores the persistence of impunity in Colombia, especially in regard to human rights violations, and the alleged links between military and paramilitaries, which are a fundamental obstacle to the observance and implementation of human rights and international humanitarian law in the country. In this context, the Commission on Human Rights notes the Standing Inter-sectoral Commission for the Coordination and Follow-up of National Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Policy as well as the Presidential Programme for the Promotion, Respect and Guarantee of Human Rights and of the Application of International Humanitarian Law. The Commission calls upon the Government of Colombia to effectively follow up these initiatives in order to define and implement actions aimed at resolving the serious situation of impunity. "8. The Commission notes Law No. 589 criminalizing forced disappearances, genocide, forced displacement and torture, as well as the Presidential Order of August 2000 instructing all the military tribunals to comply fully with the Constitutional Court ruling regarding the exclusion of their jurisdiction over conduct related to genocide, torture and enforced disappearances and other related violations of human rights. In this context, the Commission underlines that it is important that cases of violation of human rights or infringements of international humanitarian law are tried by civilian courts and that the provisions of the new Military Code and the new Ordinary Criminal Code are interpreted and applied in conformity with the relevant international standards and with the clear criteria established by the decisions of the Colombian Constitutional Court. The Commission urges the Government of Colombia to take further effective measures to address the problem of impunity and takes note of the expressed will of the Government to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (A/CONF.183/9). "9. The Commission takes note of improvements in the human rights performance of the armed forces but remains concerned at continued reports of human rights violations attributed to the armed and security forces. While the Commission notes the legal mechanisms which have led to the dismissal of military personnel in a discretionary manner, it urges the Government of Colombia to further ensure that the members of State forces against whom credible allegations exist are suspended, whilst speedy investigations are undertaken in order to bring those responsible to civilian justice. "10. The Commission strongly condemns all acts of terrorism and all breaches of international humanitarian law committed by the guerrilla groups, particularly killings and attacks on the civilian population. In this context the Commission also strongly condemns continued systematic kidnapping, especially abhorrent when directed at children. It remains deeply concerned at the continued use of child soldiers and antipersonnel landmines, as well as other non-conventional explosive devices, by the guerrillas. The Commission condemns the continued mass abductions and destruction of power lines by the ELN. It also condemns the killing of civilians, even in the demilitarized zone created as the legitimate scene for the negotiations, as well as the continuing kidnapping by the FARC. The Commission calls upon the guerrilla groups to respect international humanitarian law and to engage effectively in serious and concrete peace talks with the Government of Colombia and to agree upon a comprehensive human rights and humanitarian agreement in order to pave the way to a complete ceasefire and as a first step towards a peace agreement. "11. The Commission remains deeply concerned about the continuing grave abuses of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law committed by the paramilitary groups, including murder and massacres. It is also deeply concerned at reports involving members of State forces who collaborate with paramilitary groups and consent to or acquiesce in criminal acts such as killings of civilians. The Commission urges the Government of Colombia to take more effective steps to combat and suppress paramilitary groups and to step up actions against the economic networks which support them, as well as to intensify political, administrative, judicial and other appropriate measures with respect to official bodies, members of the armed forces and individuals suspected of supporting paramilitary groups. In this context, the Commission in particular urges the Government of Colombia to take prompt and effective measures after receiving "early warnings" in order to save lives and prevent crimes from being committed. The Commission is encouraged by the creation of a National Coordination Centre set up to coordinate all State activities to combat the paramilitaries in all their forms and calls upon the Government of Colombia to make sure that these and other related measures are effectively implemented and to ensure that those responsible are brought to civilian justice. "12. The Commission takes note of the announcement of the six-point plan put forward by the Government of Colombia in January 2001 to tackle paramilitary groups. Concrete action is now required. The Commission will closely monitor the plan's implementation by the Colombian authorities. "13. The Commission welcomes the signature by the Government of Colombia of the two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, as well as the ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction (2000), and encourages the Government to ratify the two Optional Protocols and implement them as soon as possible. The Commission also encourages the Government of Colombia to recognize the competence of the committees established under articles 21 and 22 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and under article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, as well as to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. "14. The Commission welcomes the invitation by the Government of Colombia to the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and that it will invite the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders to visit the country this year. The Commission looks forward to their reports. "15. The Commission strongly condemns the persistent and dramatically increasing attacks against human rights defenders, as well as trade unionists, persons working within the justice system, journalists, academics, students, professors and others exercising their freedom of expression, thus closing legitimate channels for democratic participation. The Commission acknowledges that the Government of Colombia has taken measures to address the problem, such as the Special Protection Programme for Witnesses and Threatened Persons under the Ministry of the Interior. However, the Commission remains seriously concerned about the slow pace of judicial investigations into crimes against human rights defenders and about the limitations of administrative, security and financial resources to protect those social and human rights defenders who find themselves at risk. In this context, the Commission welcomes the Government's determination to continue its close cooperation with the Special Representative of the Director-General of the International Labour Organization for cooperation with Colombia. "16. The Commission urges the Government of Colombia promptly to take all the necessary measures to implement effectively programme and policies, with the support of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, including to make further progress in the implementation of a national action plan, to tackle impunity and, in particular, to address concerns related to the safety of groups in need of special protection, such as human rights defenders and trade unionists. "17. The Commission strongly condemns all threats, attacks and killings of candidates in local elections and others involved in peaceful political activities by guerrillas and paramilitary groups. It calls upon all parties to respect those exercising their political rights. The Commission notes with appreciation the significant institutional effort of the Colombian State and Government in successfully holding local elections in October 2000, which proves once again the unfailing commitment to adhere to democratic rule. "18. The Commission notes with concern the concluding observations (CRC/C/15/Add.137) of the Committee on the Rights of the Child stating, inter alia, that the general climate of violence in Colombia is not only negatively affecting the implementation of the Convention of the Rights of the Child but has also led to systematic violations of the rights of the child. It welcomes the prohibition of recruitment of children under the age of 18 into the armed forces. The Commission firmly condemns the forcible recruitment of a large number of children into paramilitary and guerrilla groups. The Commission encourages the Government of Colombia to follow up on the recommendations made by the Committee. "19. The Commission deplores attacks against indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities and exhorts all actors to respect the special cultural status of minorities. It calls upon the Government of Colombia to take urgent effective steps for the improvement of the legal and physical protection of the affected groups and to develop and implement programmes that effectively address the specific needs of these exposed communities in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. "20. The Commission takes note of the acknowledgement by the Government of Colombia of its responsibility to address the situation of the internally displaced and of the progress made in creating the relevant legal and institutional frameworks. The Commission, however, remains deeply concerned about the deterioration of the situation of internally displaced persons in Colombia and the increase in their numbers. The Commission calls upon the Government of Colombia to urgently and effectively implement additional strategies, based on the recommendations made by the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons after the followup mission to Colombia in 1999, designed to protect internally displaced persons, in particular children, and to ensure their safe return. In this regard it encourages further cooperation and coordination between the Colombian authorities, international bodies, especially Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and non-governmental organizations. It encourages the Government of Colombia to continue to seek effective means to eradicate the causes of displacement, assuring further concrete results, including bringing those responsible for causing displacement to justice. The Commission calls upon the Government of Colombia to implement preventive measures, including an effective system of early warning. "21. The Commission is also concerned over the poor prison conditions and at reports of abuses of the detainees' human rights and requests the office in Colombia of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to follow this situation with a view to providing advice and cooperation to the Colombian authorities. The Commission welcomes the visits carried out by international humanitarian organizations and emphasizes the importance of allowing them access to all detainees. It encourages the Government of Colombia to proceed with the reform of the Código penitenciario y carcelario (penitentiaries and jails code). It calls upon the Government to adopt measures to fulfil international standards regarding prisoners and to protect the human rights of all detainees. "22. The Commission requests the High Commissioner to submit to it at its next session a detailed report containing an analysis by the office in Colombia of the situation of human rights in Colombia in accordance with the agreement between the Government of Colombia and the Office of the High Commissioner on the operation of the permanent office in Bogotá." 55.

IX, para. 213), and takes note of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the General Assembly at its fiftyfifth session (A/55/36), the report of the High Commissioner to the Commission at its fiftyseventh session (E/CN.4/2001/37 and Corr.1), the report of the SecretaryGeneral to the Security Council of 16 January 2001 (S/2001/42) and the letter dated 18 February 2000 from the President of the Security Council addressed to the SecretaryGeneral (S/2000/137). "The Commission acknowledges relevant Security Council and other United Nations resolutions. "The Commission welcomes the encouraging improvements of the judicial system in East Timor and the first measures that have been taken against suspects accused of crimes against humanity and other serious crimes committed during the violence in 1999 and strongly supports continuation of these investigations. It emphasizes the importance of continuing international assistance to the strengthening of the justice system in East Timor. The Commission emphasizes the importance of the ongoing reconciliation process and the full promotion and protection of human rights, including freedom of religion, aimed at ensuring future social and political stability in East Timor. The Commission welcomes the forthcoming establishment of a truth, reception and reconciliation commission. "The Commission recalls the commitment of the Government of Indonesia to ensure that the violations of human rights and humanitarian law committed during the violence in 1999 are accounted for and welcomes in this context the concrete steps already taken by the Government of Indonesia, including the efforts by the AttorneyGeneral of Indonesia to investigate fully the violations of human rights and international and humanitarian law perpetrated in East Timor in the period leading up to and immediately following the popular consultation held in August 1999. The Commission notes with appreciation the decision adopted on 21 March 2001 by the Parliament of Indonesia pursuant to Law No. 26/2000 proposing that the Government set up an ad hoc human rights court in order to bring to justice those suspected of committing such violations. Accordingly, the Commission urges the Government of Indonesia to establish the proposed ad hoc human rights court without delay, and to bring to justice those responsible for violations of human rights and humanitarian law abuses in East Timor. "The Commission will continue to monitor developments closely and in the light thereof consider whether further action would be required. The Commission welcomes the cooperation between the Government of Indonesia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with a view to enhancing the capacity of the judicial system and, in particular, the functioning of the ad hoc human rights courts in full respect of international human rights standards. "The Commission recalls the commitment by the Government of Indonesia to cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner, as affirmed in the memorandum of understanding signed by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor and the Government of Indonesia. It reiterates the need for enhanced bilateral cooperation between the Transitional Administration and the Government of Indonesia as foreseen in the memorandum of understanding signed by the parties, and stresses the importance that the spirit of the agreement be followed and implemented fully as foreseen. "The Commission recalls Security Council resolution 1319 (2000) of 8 September 2000 condemning the brutal murders last September of three international staff members of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Atambua, West Timor, as well as attacks on the United Nations presence in East Timor. The Commission expects that the ongoing trials of the suspects in Indonesia will be conducted in conformity with international standards of justice and fairness. "The Commission urges the Government of Indonesia, while acknowledging the efforts already made by the Government of Indonesia, to continue, without further delay, to fulfil its responsibility to disarm and disband the militia, to restore security in the refugee camps in West Timor and to take measures to ensure that the refugees can make a free and informed choice whether to return to East Timor or resettle in Indonesia. The Commission, concerned at the large numbers of East Timorese refugees still in camps in West Timor, encourages the Government of Indonesia to strengthen its endeavours to resolve this problem in accordance with Security Council resolutions 1319 (2000) and 1338 (2001) of 31 January 2001. It urges the Government of Indonesia to ensure full and secure humanitarian access to the refugee camps. It notes the practical arrangements made on an ad hoc basis by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, the International Organization for Migration and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in support of the Indonesian efforts on repatriation and stresses the need to enhance the level of cooperation between the Government of Indonesia and those international organizations. In this regard the Commission welcomes the announcement of a joint visit to the refugee camps in West Timor to be undertaken by the Transitional Administration, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration, together with the Indonesian Armed Forces. All efforts should be made to complete the refugee repatriation programme in full accordance with international standards, including the need for an impartial and transparent process of registration of refugees in order to enable the refugees to register to vote in the East Timor general elections to be held on 30 August 2001. "The Commission recalls the importance of a speedy resolution of this question for the laying of a strong foundation for future relations and peaceful coexistence between East Timor and Indonesia. Reconciliation and justice lie at the heart of the many issues facing East Timor during the transition period and beyond. The Commission calls for continued international support before and after independence of East Timor. "The Commission decides to keep these matters under consideration and requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftysixth session and to report to the Commission at its fifty-eighth session." 240. The Commission considered agenda item 10 at its 31st to 36th meetings, from 2 to 4 April, at its 70th meeting, on 20 April, and at its 71st meeting, on 23 April 2001.21 241.

At the 79th meeting, the Chairperson, on behalf of the Commission, made a statement concerning technical cooperation and the situation of human rights in Haiti. (For the text, see below, paragraph 604.) 604. During the consideration of agenda item 19, the Chairperson made a statement, the text of which reads as follows: "Technical cooperation and the situation of human rights in Haiti "The Commission welcomes the visit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Haiti to this body and takes note of his recognition that, while there has been some progress on human rights in Haiti, problems persist with regard to the administration of justice, impunity, prolonged detention and prison conditions. "The Commission also takes note of the request by the Government of Haiti for assistance in addressing these issues and in improving human rights, and pledges to give this request serious consideration, while recognizing that primary responsibility remains with the Haitians. "The Commission encourages the Government of Haiti and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider seriously undertaking a programme of technical cooperation and assistance, particularly for capacitybuilding in, inter alia, State institutions, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Judges School, the administration of justice and civil society. Such a programme might include an Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights office in Haiti at some point in the future. "The Commission calls upon the Government of Haiti to consider ratifying the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. "The Commission expresses deep concern that a political impasse in Haiti remains unresolved and stems originally from a flawed method for counting first-round results and other electoral controversies that compromised the May 2000 legislative elections. It deeply regrets that mediation efforts have not succeeded in achieving a fruitful dialogue. "The Commission notes that the November 2000 presidential and partial legislative elections adhered to constitutional process and relevant electoral laws, but regrets that those elections did not benefit from the full participation of Haiti's diverse political actors and civil society. It welcomes commitments made by the Government of Haiti to rectify the problems associated with the May 2000 legislative elections and other electoral and political issues, and urges negotiation towards a national accord. "The Commission welcomes and encourages the mediation efforts of the Organization of American States, the Caribbean Community and members of Haitian civil society to bring about dialogue and reconciliation among Haiti's political forces. It calls on the Government of Haiti and all political parties to participate actively and constructively in those efforts with a view to an agreed outcome in the national interest. "The Commission welcomes the judicial effort to hold the Raboteau and CarrefourFeuilles trials in a fair and transparent manner, bringing to justice the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and demonstrating the potential for improving respect for the rule of law and combating impunity. "The Commission calls upon the Government of Haiti to investigate thoroughly politically motivated crimes, including the assassination of journalist Jean Dominique, to prosecute accused perpetrators of such crimes in accordance with Haitian law, to institute legal proceedings against perpetrators of human rights violations identified by the National Commission for Truth and Justice, and to ensure the neutrality of the police. "The Commission on Human Rights encourages the Government of Haiti to take vigorous action to eliminate human rights violations, including illegal arrest and detention, to improve prison conditions, to ensure due process and, in this regard, to strengthen the Office of the Ombudsman. "The Commission condemns acts of violence, in particular politically motivated violence, encourages all the political parties and all concerned to refrain from making inflammatory remarks, calls on members of popular organizations to cease intimidation and harassment of political activists and urges the government authorities to protect all Haitian citizens and their constitutional rights to assemble peacefully and express their political opinions. "The Commission, noting that the United Nations International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti ended its mandate in February, observes an ongoing need in Haiti to promote and protect all human rights and to reinforce the institutional effectiveness of the police and judiciary, and invites the international community to assist Haiti in these efforts. "The Commission also expresses concern over Haiti's restaveks, children who are placed in domestic service, sometimes against their will and in deplorable conditions, and encourages the efforts of the Government of Haiti supported by the United Nations Children's Fund, the International Labour Organization and other entities working to improve the situation. The Commission encourages the Government of Haiti to promote the rights of children, in particular their right to education. The Commission also expresses concern about the difficult socioeconomic situation in Haiti, which continues to exact a heavy toll on the lives of the Haitian people. "The Commission takes note of the report of the former independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti (E/CN.4/2001/106) of 30 January 2001 and requests a new independent expert to report to the General Assembly at its fiftysixth session and to the Commission at its fiftyeighth session on developments in the situation of human rights and technical cooperation for human rights in Haiti. The Commission decides to continue its consideration of the situation of human rights in Haiti at its fiftyeighth session under the agenda item entitled `Advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights'." 605. The Commission considered agenda item 20 at its 74th and 75th meetings, on 24 April 2001.50 606. For the documents issued under agenda item 20, see annex VI to the present report.
