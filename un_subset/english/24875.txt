Letter dated 23 May 2003 from the President of the Security Council addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to refer to your letter of 16 April 2003 (S/2003/431), attaching for the consideration of the members of the Security Council a letter, dated 26 March 2003, from the President of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, Judge Navanethem Pillay. In her letter, President Pillay requested extensions of the terms of office of four non-elected permanent judges of the Tribunal in order to allow them to dispose of a number of ongoing cases. I also have the honour to refer to your letter of 8 May 2003 (S/2003/551), attaching for the consideration of the members of the Security Council a further letter, dated 6 May 2003, from President Pillay. In her letter, President Pillay provided certain information and documentation which had been requested by the members of the Security Council to assist them in the further consideration of the requests contained in her letter of 26 March 2003. Those letters have been carefully considered by the members of the Security Council. The Security Council has decided to accede, with one exception, to the requests that President Pillay had made in her letter of 26 March 2003. The Council's decision is contained in its resolution 1482 (2003) of 19 May 2003. As will be apparent from the text of that resolution, the Security Council has decided not to accede to President Pillay's request that Judge Maqutu, once replaced as a member of the Tribunal, be authorized to finish the Butare case, which he had begun before expiry of his term of office. In this connection, I have been asked to convey to President Pillay, through you, the suggestion that the International Tribunal may wish to review notably Rule 15 bis C of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and Evidence with a view to amending it, so as to avoid the occurrence of situations in which the President of the International Tribunal might be obliged to request that the term of office of a permanent judge be extended in order to allow him or her to dispose of one or more ongoing cases. (Signed) Munir Akram President of the Security Council
