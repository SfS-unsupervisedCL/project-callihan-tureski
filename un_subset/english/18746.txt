UNITED NATIONS E Economic and Social Council Distr. Original: COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS Fifty-eighth session Agenda item 3 ORGANIZATION OF THE WORK OF THE SESSION Letter dated 12 April 2002 from the Permanent Representative of Viet Nam to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed to the Chairperson of the fifty-eighth session of the Commission on Human Rights I would like to draw your kind attention to the illegal presence, at the current session of the Commission, of the terrorist group which admitted itself to be recruited by the CIA and United States army to fight the regime in Viet Nam and named the Montagnard Foundation Inc. The participation of such terrorist group under the umbrella of the Transnational Radical Party as an NGO in the meetings of the Commission is a clear violation of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31 and causes anxiety as well as concern over the work of the Commission and its proceedings. This is a misuse of the Commission by an unqualified nongovernmental organization, as pointed out by the Like-Minded Group, the Asian Group and a number of delegations under item 3 of the agenda. I request that you in your capacity as Chairman of the Commission take the necessary measures to prevent the participation of the above-mentioned group in all the Commission's meetings and immediately cancel the scheduled briefing of this group on 15 April 2002 in room XXII, from 13.00 to 15.00. I would also request you to circulate this letter as an official document of the fifty-eighth session of the Commission on Human Rights. (Signed): NGUYEN Quy Binh Ambassador Permanent Representative GE.02-12857 (E) 170402
