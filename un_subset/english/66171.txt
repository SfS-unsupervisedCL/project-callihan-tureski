General Assembly Sixty-seventh session Agenda item 43 Question of Cyprus Security Council Sixty-eighth year Letter dated 5 April 2013 from the Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Upon instructions from my Government, I transmit herewith the recorded infringements of international air traffic regulations and violations of the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus by Turkey, committed during the month of March 2013 (see annex). I have the honour to draw your attention to the systematic infringement by Turkey of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus by blatantly violating international rules in a way that seriously jeopardizes international aviation safety in the region. I should be grateful if you would circulate this letter and its annex as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 43, and of the Security Council.
