I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 13. (Signed) Vitaly Churkin Statement of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan New York 26 September 2009 The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan express their support for the initiative of the Russian Federation to develop and conclude a European Security treaty, as well as the intention of the States members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization to contribute to furthering that initiative in various international environments. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the States members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization particularly emphasize the importance of establishing a sustainable system of collective international security based around universally recognized principles and standards of international law, of having the United Nations occupy a central role in connection with peacekeeping and international security, and of making it unacceptable to isolate any State or to enable the emergence of zones with unequal levels of security. The Ministers favour a system of unified, equal and indivisible security for all States in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian areas and underline the need for strict adherence to the commitment made by States at the highest level not to strengthen their own security at the expense of others' security. The Ministers call for meetings between leaders of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to discuss the security strategies adopted within those organizations, as the first step towards establishing an indivisible area of security.
