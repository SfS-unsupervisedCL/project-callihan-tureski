As these outputs will apply to the entire system, the inter-agency task force on security sector reform (and not exclusively the Department of Peacekeeping Operations) is leading the process of developing technical guidance in specific areas related to security sector reform. A set of interim guidelines, scheduled for completion by March 2010, will be developed with a view to the formulation of more formal guidelines by March 2012 1 study by external consultants on options for structuring security sector reform capacities within integrated mission structures A consultant report was completed in August 2008, and the results were used to inform the structure of emerging security sector reform capacities in MONUC, UNMIS and UNPOS. In addition, profiles of security sector reform experts described in the consultant report were used for the development of 11 generic vacancy announcements. Subsequently, 200 candidates were assessed for technical clearance 2 sets of departmental guidelines on the establishment and implementation of security sector reform strategies in post-conflict contexts A set of interim guidelines on 6 aspects of security sector reform (defence sector reform; security sector reform and peace agreements; national security policies, strategies and plans; governance and oversight of the security sector; monitoring and evaluation of security sector reform programmes; and international coordination of support for security sector reform) are under development and scheduled for completion in March 2010.

This entailed reviewing investigation reports in order to request follow-up actions when allegations were substantiated, and closing cases when allegations were unsubstantiated Lower output of category I allegations attributable to a reduction in investigations involving allegations against groups of individuals (111 individuals in one instance during the previous reporting period), with investigations in response to allegations against individuals Increased overall output due to the introduction of the Misconduct Tracking System, resulting in enhanced recording and tracking of such allegations and action taken Conduct and discipline policies updated Developed a standard operating procedure regarding the application of the revised model memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and troop-contributing countries; developed updated material for the module on conduct and discipline in the new core predeployment training of all peacekeeping personnel; promulgated updated guidance to peacekeeping and special political missions on addressing allegations of misconduct and communicating information in conduct and discipline matters; provided content for the revision of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations Mission Start-up Field Guide; and began development of a field advisory manual for conduct and discipline teams in missions.

The new contractual arrangements and conditions of service for non-family missions were implemented in all missions effective 1 July 2009. Field Personnel Division web page was launched, providing staff with information on human resources reforms Rosters in 22 occupational groups relevant to peacekeeping operations are maintained Occupational groups Rosters established for 24 occupational groups Outreach activities Online career support for staff members in the field and through e-mail and delivery of direct career support training and consultation to 600 staff members in 4 field missions (UNMIS, UNAMID, UNIFIL, MONUC) Support provided to staff in 5 field missions (UNIIIC, UNIOSIL, UNMEE, UNMIK and UNMIN), 335 of whom were placed in other missions. Priority placed on the allocation of resources to missions being downsized and missions in liquidation in order to provide urgent career counselling and placement support to affected staff Phased implementation of a career development strategy, comprising online career path models for selected occupational groups, including the re-profiling of Chief of Section positions in field mission/office support functions to better meet the evolving needs of field operations The implementation of a career development strategy has been suspended pending the roll-out of the "staff development" element of the talent management framework currently being developed by the Office of Human Resources Management. However, career-path models for succession management are currently in the design phase. Such models define the competencies, professional experience and training/certification required at each grade level within an occupational group and illustrate the linkages to related occupational groups within the greater occupational network along which staff can move, either laterally or to the next highest level The exercise of re-profiling the civilian personnel functions was undertaken and discussed at a chief civilian personnel officer/Human Resources Network conference held in May 2009. New generic job profiles are being developed for submission to the Office of Human Resources Management for approval in 2010 Chief civilian personnel officer conference and the United Nations inter-agency career development round table organized and attended A chief civilian personnel officer/Human Resources Network conference was held in May 2009. 34 chief civilian personnel officers and executive officers from all field operations and special political missions attended Attended the inter-agency career development round table on "Courting talent: challenges for international organizations", held in The Hague in November 2008 Roll-out of the human resources action plans to all peace operations, based on lessons learned from ongoing pilot project for the implementation of such plans for 5 missions (UNAMA, UNMIT, UNMIL, MINUSTAH and UNMIS) The human resources action plans were formalized in all peacekeeping missions (July 2008) The human resources action plans were formalized in all special political missions (January 2009) Oversight and evaluation of the performance of human resources management functions in the field in 4 field missions (UNAMID, UNMIS, UNAMA and UNAMI) through participation in 4 Office of Human Resources Management monitoring visits The Office of Human Resources Management and the Field Personnel Division carried out joint monitoring visits to MINURSO in June 2009.

More than 200 recommendations were issued, aimed at improving the aviation operational environment and reducing the level of risk. Through Headquarters, the Office communicates to the directors of mission support or chiefs of mission support of the mission concerned all observations, findings and recommendations arising from its visits. An operational risk management policy was introduced in all missions. Road maps for operational risk management implementation were developed and implementation task groups formed in all missions under the guidance of Headquarters.
