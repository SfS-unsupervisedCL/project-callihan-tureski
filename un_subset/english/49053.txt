On a routine basis, the Conduct and Discipline Unit provided conduct and discipline teams with systemic and operational technical support relating to the applicability of the standards of conduct to various categories of peacekeeping personnel, as well as to the interpretation of the standards in their application, and technical advice on addressing allegations of misconduct through investigations and the disciplinary process 5 visits to peacekeeping operations and 4 training/workshop sessions for personnel in Conduct and Discipline Units, including one Chief of Conduct and Discipline Unit workshop, to provide updates and technical advice on conduct and discipline issues Visits carried out to UNMIL and UNOCI in October 2008 and to MONUC and MINURCAT in June 2009 A workshop was held on the use of the Misconduct Tracking System (United Nations Logistics Base, June 2009); at another workshop, chiefs of Conduct and Discipline Teams discussed policies and practices (New York, January 2009) Lower output due to the fact that, as a result of donor funding, specialized expertise (trainer) on conduct and discipline was available only as from April 2009, as well as to time constraints in coordinating the fifth assessment visit 3 visits to troop-contributing countries for monitoring of the deployment training on conduct and discipline and sexual exploitation and abuse Visit carried out. The Conduct and Discipline Unit conducted a "training-focused" mission to the regional peacekeeping training centre. The aim of the visit was to obtain first-hand information about training currently delivered by the centre, as well as to pilot-test and conduct a training-of-trainers course for the centre's trainers on the new core predeployment training modules Lower output due to constraints in coordinating the timing of visits and the development of the modules, for which specialized expertise on training became available, through donor funding, only as from April 2009 Action taken on an estimated 300 category I allegations investigated by the Office of Internal Oversight Services and by peacekeeping field missions and referred to Headquarters, and an estimated 200 category II misconduct investigations in 19 peacekeeping operations or special political missions and the United Nations Logistics Base, including action on recommendations relating to Board of Inquiry cases Category I allegations of serious misconduct, including 123 Office of Internal Oversight Services investigation reports Category II allegations of misconduct. The Unit took action on all investigation reports received during the reporting period. This entailed reviewing investigation reports in order to request follow-up actions when allegations were substantiated, and closing cases when allegations were unsubstantiated Lower output of category I allegations attributable to a reduction in investigations involving allegations against groups of individuals (111 individuals in one instance during the previous reporting period), with investigations in response to allegations against individuals Increased overall output due to the introduction of the Misconduct Tracking System, resulting in enhanced recording and tracking of such allegations and action taken Conduct and discipline policies updated Developed a standard operating procedure regarding the application of the revised model memorandum of understanding between the United Nations and troop-contributing countries; developed updated material for the module on conduct and discipline in the new core predeployment training of all peacekeeping personnel; promulgated updated guidance to peacekeeping and special political missions on addressing allegations of misconduct and communicating information in conduct and discipline matters; provided content for the revision of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations Mission Start-up Field Guide; and began development of a field advisory manual for conduct and discipline teams in missions.

The new contractual arrangements and conditions of service for non-family missions were implemented in all missions effective 1 July 2009. Field Personnel Division web page was launched, providing staff with information on human resources reforms Rosters in 22 occupational groups relevant to peacekeeping operations are maintained Occupational groups Rosters established for 24 occupational groups Outreach activities Online career support for staff members in the field and through e-mail and delivery of direct career support training and consultation to 600 staff members in 4 field missions (UNMIS, UNAMID, UNIFIL, MONUC) Support provided to staff in 5 field missions (UNIIIC, UNIOSIL, UNMEE, UNMIK and UNMIN), 335 of whom were placed in other missions. Priority placed on the allocation of resources to missions being downsized and missions in liquidation in order to provide urgent career counselling and placement support to affected staff Phased implementation of a career development strategy, comprising online career path models for selected occupational groups, including the re-profiling of Chief of Section positions in field mission/office support functions to better meet the evolving needs of field operations The implementation of a career development strategy has been suspended pending the roll-out of the "staff development" element of the talent management framework currently being developed by the Office of Human Resources Management. However, career-path models for succession management are currently in the design phase. Such models define the competencies, professional experience and training/certification required at each grade level within an occupational group and illustrate the linkages to related occupational groups within the greater occupational network along which staff can move, either laterally or to the next highest level The exercise of re-profiling the civilian personnel functions was undertaken and discussed at a chief civilian personnel officer/Human Resources Network conference held in May 2009. New generic job profiles are being developed for submission to the Office of Human Resources Management for approval in 2010 Chief civilian personnel officer conference and the United Nations inter-agency career development round table organized and attended A chief civilian personnel officer/Human Resources Network conference was held in May 2009. 34 chief civilian personnel officers and executive officers from all field operations and special political missions attended Attended the inter-agency career development round table on "Courting talent: challenges for international organizations", held in The Hague in November 2008 Roll-out of the human resources action plans to all peace operations, based on lessons learned from ongoing pilot project for the implementation of such plans for 5 missions (UNAMA, UNMIT, UNMIL, MINUSTAH and UNMIS) The human resources action plans were formalized in all peacekeeping missions (July 2008) The human resources action plans were formalized in all special political missions (January 2009) Oversight and evaluation of the performance of human resources management functions in the field in 4 field missions (UNAMID, UNMIS, UNAMA and UNAMI) through participation in 4 Office of Human Resources Management monitoring visits The Office of Human Resources Management and the Field Personnel Division carried out joint monitoring visits to MINURSO in June 2009.

Through Headquarters, the Office communicates to the directors of mission support or chiefs of mission support of the mission concerned all observations, findings and recommendations arising from its visits. An operational risk management policy was introduced in all missions. Road maps for operational risk management implementation were developed and implementation task groups formed in all missions under the guidance of Headquarters.

Hospitals in Dubai were visited, evaluated and approved as evacuation destinations Medical examination of 1,270 candidates for mission deployment or travel Medical examinations conducted. The number of medical examinations to be conducted had been planned on the basis of the anticipated expansion of the newly established field operations of MINURCAT and UNAMID The lower output was due to the delegation of authority to the Chief Medical Officer of UNAMID, and to the lower number of staff deployed from Headquarters to the missions during the reporting period 2,500 pre-mission briefings and consultations on health-related issues The number of pre-mission briefings and consultations to be provided had been planned on the basis of the anticipated expansion of the newly established field operations of MINURCAT and UNAMID.

Advice was provided to UNMIK on the preparation of additional multimedia archives 100,000 pages of peacekeeping archives posted on the United Nations Internet site for public consultation Pages posted.
