The workshop was aimed at raising awareness of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms among governmental representatives of the West African countries, enhancing practical skills while compiling national reports and encouraging greater participation of States from the region in the Register. 3. Furthermore, the Office for Disarmament Affairs produced relevant background publications on the subject, which can be accessed at the web page as follows: http://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/ODAPublications/OccasionalPapers.

Information received from Governments is presented below as follows: :: Section A -- an index received by the Secretary-General; :: Section B -- individual replies of Governments on transfers of conventional arms. Where appropriate, the relevant parts of notes verbale are reproduced. 5. The index of returns is provided for ease of reference. As regards the information contained in the index, it should be noted that a "yes" denotes a submission of data regarding imports and/or exports in relation to the seven categories of arms covered by the Register during the reporting period. For the purpose of uniform tabulation, responses by Governments that contained either "nil", "none", "0", a dash (-) or which otherwise indicated that no exports and/or imports in the categories covered by the Register had taken place are reflected in the tables as "nil" reports. A blank space under data on imports and/or exports in the index of information indicates that no information was provided. In some cases, however, an explanation can be found in the note verbale of the country in question, as indicated above. Only those parts of the standardized forms that contain specific data and notes verbale of Governments providing relevant information, are reproduced in section B. Replies in the standardized reporting forms and the simplified "nil" reporting form or in notes verbale containing "nil" or blank reports are listed in the index of information only.
