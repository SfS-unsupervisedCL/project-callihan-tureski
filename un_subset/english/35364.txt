Sixty-first session Request for the inclusion of an additional item in the agenda of the sixty-first session Extension of the terms of the ad litem judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994 Note by the Secretary-General 1. By his letters to the General Assembly and Security Council dated 2 October 2006, the Secretary-General requested both the Assembly and the Council to authorize the extension of the terms of the ad litem judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda until 31 December 2008. 2. The current terms of the ad litem judges come to an end on 24 June 2007. The Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda does not provide for extending the terms of office of the ad litem judges. In the absence of such a provision, the approval of the Security Council, as the parent organ of the Tribunal, and of the General Assembly, as the organ that elects its judges, would be needed in order to extend the terms of office of the ad litem judges of the International Tribunal until 31 December 2008. 3. In order for the General Assembly to consider the above-mentioned matter, the Secretary-General has the honour, pursuant to rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, to request the inclusion, in the agenda of the sixty-first session, of an additional item of an important and urgent character entitled, "Extension of the terms of the ad litem judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994". The Secretary-General requests that the item be considered directly in plenary meeting.
