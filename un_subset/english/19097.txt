UNITED NATIONS Convention to Combat Desertification Distr. ICCD/CRIC(1)/7/Add.1 2 September 2002 Original: ENGLISH COMMITTEE FOR THE REVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION First session 18-29 November 2002 Item 3 (c) of the provisional agenda REVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONVENTION, PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 22, PARAGRAPH 2(A) AND (B), AND ARTICLE 26 OF THE CONVENTION REVIEW OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BY RELEVANT ORGANS, FUNDS AND PROGRAMMES OF THE UNITED NATIONS SYSTEM, AS WELL AS OTHER INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, ON THEIR ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF THE PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION PROGRAMMES UNDER THE CONVENTION Addendum Note by the secretariat The following summary has been prepared by the secretariat based on the latest contribution received from the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The full text of the contribution is available on the UNCCD Web site (http://www.unccd.int). GE.02-63920 1. The General Secretariat of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has undertaken a number of activities and actions in support of the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in Africa, especially in relation to preparatory activities for national and regional action programmes. This support was realized within the broad context of OAU's participation in the activities of its regional and subregional organizations and agencies, and through direct financial assistance to some of its Member States and to the UNCCD secretariat. 2. Between 1998 and 2001, the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (OAU/SEAF) provided financial assistance to a number of its Member States to implement activities to combat both the causes and effects of desertification and land degradation in the context of UNCCD. This assistance went to Sudan (US$ 500,000), Chad (US$ 500,000), the United Republic of Tanzania (US$ 800,000), Cameroon (US$ 1,010,000) and Niger (US$ 40,500). 3. The OAU participated in and assisted the African Preparatory Conference for the fifth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 5) held in Maputo, Mozambique, from 27 to 29 August 2001. The Organization also provided funding for simultaneous interpretation to ensure effective participation by the African group in the deliberations of the COP 5 in Geneva in October 2001. 4. At its 26th Ordinary Session in February 2002, the Policy Committee of the SEAF/OUA, following a request from the UNCCD secretariat for supplementary funding for its transboundary projects in the Sahel and Maghreb border regions, granted the latter an additional sum of US $540,140. The OAU and the UNCCD secretariat have since signed a Grant Agreement for the utilization of these new funds. The additional grant will allow the UNCCD secretariat to continue with the transboundary activities it started with the initial grant of US$ 300,000 and to initiate new ones. Through this new grant, desertification control and food security projects will be implemented in selected boundary areas of Algeria/Tunisia, Algeria/Mali, Senegal/Mauritania; Mali/Mauritania/Senegal, Mali/Burkina Faso/Niger, Niger/Burkina Faso; and a special project in Mauritania for water management and agricultural production. This second phase of the transboundary projects is planned to last for two years beginning in 2002. 5. The OAU/SEAF also approved an amount of US$ 137,860 for a one-year extension of the Sudan project starting in February 2002. In order to open up additional grazing land and thus reduce the pressure on some of the existing land, thereby contributing to reversing land degradation in the project areas, this extension will focus on the eradication of the mesquite plant from grazing lands. 6. The 26th ordinary session of the Policy Committee of the OAU/SEAF further granted the Government of Senegal the sum of US$ 193,810.64 to undertake rehabilitation of saline soils in the delta area within the Ross-Bethio community of Diagana province in the Saint-Louis region. The project will involve reforestation and improving water supply to the local community to assist small-scale agricultural production. 7. In view of the need to strengthen natural resource management in Africa and to facilitate the implementation of related international conventions such as the UNCCD, the OAU, with support from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN), has spearheaded the revision of the 1968 Africa Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources to bring the latter up to date with present-day international law pertaining to the environment and natural resources, especially within the Rio family. A meeting of African experts in Nairobi in January 2002 examined a draft revision of this Convention. Arrangements are currently underway for ministerial consideration of the draft revised Convention prior to its submission for adoption and signature by the African Heads of State and Government in the near future. 8. The UNCCD will continue to be regarded as an umbrella convention for Africa for environment and natural resources management.
