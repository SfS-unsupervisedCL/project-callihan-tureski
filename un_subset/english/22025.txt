In its resolution 55/61 of 4 December 2000, the General Assembly recognized that an effective international legal instrument against corruption, independent of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (resolution 55/25, annex I) was desirable and decided to establish an ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument. 2. The Intergovernmental Open-Ended Expert Group to Prepare Draft Terms of Reference for the Negotiation of a Future Legal Instrument against Corruption, convened pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55/61, met in Vienna from 30 July to 3 August 2001 and recommended to the Assembly, through the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the Economic and Social Council, the adoption of a draft resolution on the terms of reference for the negotiation of an international legal instrument against corruption. The draft resolution was subsequently adopted by the Assembly as resolution 56/260 of 31 January 2002. 3. In its resolution 56/260, the General Assembly decided that the Ad Hoc Committee for the Negotiation of a Convention against Corruption should negotiate a broad and effective convention, which, subject to the final determination of its title, should be referred to as the "United Nations Convention against Corruption". 4. In the same resolution, the General Assembly requested the Ad Hoc Committee, in developing the draft convention, to adopt a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach and to consider, inter alia, the following indicative elements: definitions; scope; protection of sovereignty; preventive measures; criminalization; sanctions and remedies; confiscation and seizure; jurisdiction; liability of legal persons; protection of witnesses and victims; promoting and strengthening international cooperation; preventing and combating the transfer of funds of illicit origin derived from acts of corruption, including the laundering of funds, and returning such funds; technical assistance; collection, exchange and analysis of information; and mechanisms for monitoring implementation. II. Organization of the session 5. The Ad Hoc Committee for the Negotiation of a Convention against Corruption held its seventh session in Vienna from 29 September to 1 October 2003, during which it held six plenary meetings with simultaneous interpretation in the six official languages of the United Nations. 6. At the 136th meeting, on 29 September, the Officer-in-Charge of the Division for Treaty Affairs of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime opened the session by recalling the recent sad event of the passing away of HÃ©ctor Charry Samper (Colombia), Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee. The Officer-in-Charge asked the Ad Hoc Committee to observe a moment of silence in memory of Mr. Charry Samper. 7. The Officer-in-Charge recalled that Mr. Charry Samper had applied his vast experience and profound knowledge, together with his passion for justice and the rule of law, with generosity and commitment in his work as Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee. He had cared deeply about the future convention. He had left no position or concern unheeded. He had shared the tasks and had stood at the side of all members of the bureau, supporting and guiding whenever necessary. 8. The Officer-in-Charge informed the Ad Hoc Committee that its bureau had met on 25 September to consider the procedural matter that had arisen as a result of the untimely death of its Chairman. In honour of his memory, the bureau had decided to recommend to the Ad Hoc Committee the following: (a) That the composition of the bureau of the Ad Hoc Committee remain unchanged; (b) That the representative of Jordan be asked to serve as Acting Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee at its seventh session. 9. The bureau had shared its recommendations with the chairmen of the regional groups on 25 September. 10. At the beginning of its seventh session, the Ad Hoc Committee approved the recommendations of the bureau. 11. At the 136th meeting, on 29 September 2003, all those who made statements paid tribute to the late Hector Charry Samper (Colombia), Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee, for his leadership and wisdom in guiding the negotiations on the draft convention, and expressed their condolences to his family. 12. The Acting Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee underlined the fact that the Ad Hoc Committee was close to fulfilling the mandate given by the General Assembly in its resolution 56/260. He noted that the future convention would be of high quality and would be worded in a way that would make it possible for States to ratify it as quickly as possible; and it would reinforce existing national and international laws against corruption and set practical standards to strengthen the global fight against corruption. He called upon delegations to continue to be flexible and cooperative during the negotiations on the final text of the draft convention. 13. The representative of Chile, speaking on behalf of the Member States of the United Nations that are members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, highlighted the contributions that Mr. Charry Samper had made to the work of the Group, as well as to the work of the Ad Hoc Committee. 14. The representative of Brazil, speaking on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of 77 and China, stated that the members of the Group wished to acknowledge the spirit of consensus exhibited by all delegates, even in the face of difficult choices. Emphasizing that the issue of "return of assets" was of the utmost importance to the Group, he expressed the hope that the outstanding issues concerning definition of phrases such as "illicitly acquired assets", "recovery of assets" and "affected State Party" would be settled in accordance with the agreements reached on chapter V of the draft convention during the sixth session of the Ad Hoc Committee. With regard to the definition of the term "corruption", he stated that the future convention should provide for the possibility of application to all acts of corruption included in chapter III, as well as to such acts as States parties might criminalize or had already criminalized. He also stressed the importance of article 4, which was in accordance with the fundamental principles of international law, in order to protect countries against arbitrary acts. Regarding article 42, paragraph 3, he emphasized the need for the future convention itself to regulate the administration and return of proceeds of corruption by the competent authorities, especially in the light of the agreements reached in chapter V during the sixth session. He called for a solution based on consensus regarding article 53, paragraph 9, which was of extreme importance to developing nations seeking the widest measure of international cooperation, in particular the recovery of proceeds of corruption, even in the absence of dual criminality. In that regard, he drew the attention of the Ad Hoc Committee to the efforts made in the informal consultations on the matter as a good basis for finding a compromise. As the Ad Hoc Committee at its sixth session had agreed to delete the concept of sharing assets from article 61, he requested the consistency group to examine any inconsistency between the present article 61 and article 75, paragraph 2 (c). He also urged all States, including federal States, to ensure that the future convention would be applicable to all their constituent states and territories. Finally, he encouraged States to show their political commitment by being represented at high political levels during the High-level Political Conference for the Purpose of Signing the United Nations Convention against Corruption, to be held in Merida, Mexico, from 9 to 11 December 2003. 15. The representative of Italy, speaking on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union, as well as the acceding countries (Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia) and the associate countries (Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey), stated that the European Union continued to participate actively in the Ad Hoc Committee. He noted that, in view of the important results achieved in areas of great relevance to the effectiveness and balance of the future convention at the sixth session, he was confident that the Ad Hoc Committee would reach consensus on the remaining issues within the allotted time. He reiterated the commitment of the European Union to contributing to the negotiations to that end. 16. The representative of the Syrian Arab Republic, speaking on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of Arab States, expressed confidence that the Ad Hoc Committee would achieve consensus and finalize the draft convention under the leadership of the Acting Chairman. He emphasized that article 3 of the draft convention should be broad enough to cover all offences. He also stressed that article 42, which was of paramount importance, should be clear so that its provision could be applied by all States parties to the future convention. In addition, he underlined the importance of article 53, paragraph 9. He expressed confidence that the Ad Hoc Committee could complete its work and produce a text that all States would wish to comply with, so as to contribute to the global fight against corruption. 17. On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of African States, the representative of Tunisia pledged the support of the Group to the proposal of Nigeria regarding article 53, paragraph 9, on mutual legal assistance and dual criminality. 18. The Minister of Justice of the Philippines stated that his Government subscribed fully to the maxim that public office was a public trust and was guided by the principle that all public officials must at all times be accountable to the people; serve them with the utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency; act with patriotism and justice; and lead modest lives. He gave a detailed account of the institutions that his Government had established and the legislation adopted to prevent and combat corruption, to recover the vast resources that might have been illegally amassed by corrupt officials and to promote a high standard of ethics in public service. He noted that his Government had also stepped up its drive against corrupt officials by conducting lifestyle checks on all officials who had allegedly acquired property manifestly out of proportion to their lawful income. He noted that his Government recognized the importance of the new convention in fostering international cooperation and facilitating asset recovery. 19. The Acting Chairman expressed his gratitude to the Minister of Justice of the Philippines and stated that his presence at the seventh session of the Ad Hoc Committee was a confirmation of the unwavering commitment to the successful conclusion of the work of the Ad Hoc Committee and to the new convention that his Government had demonstrated consistently throughout the negotiation process. 20. The representative of Ecuador reported on the efforts taken by his Government to combat corruption by establishing effective anti-corruption bodies and pursuing a pragmatic approach to deal with corrupt practices. 21. The representative of China stated that preliminary agreement had been reached on the draft convention, thus laying down internationally agreed principles in the field of international law. He stressed that his delegation had played a positive role in the negotiation of the various provisions of the draft convention. He stated that his delegation would continue to consult other delegations in a flexible and constructive manner so as to achieve a successful conclusion of the negotiations. 22. The representatives of Algeria and Guatemala paid tribute to the former Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee for his outstanding leadership and expressed their deep sorrow at his passing. 23. The representative of Colombia expressed his gratitude to all delegations for their kind words with respect to the sudden passing of the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee. He noted that their messages of solidarity and sympathy would be conveyed to Mr. Charry Samper's family. 24. The seventh session of the Ad Hoc Committee was attended by representatives of 114 States. Also attending the seventh session were observers for specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations.

In closing the session, the Acting Chairman expressed his appreciation to all delegations for their efforts, which had enabled the Ad Hoc Committee to achieve its goal within the time limit set by the General Assembly. He noted that the new convention would enhance international, regional and national efforts to curb corruption, which posed a threat to national security and stability and undermined respect for the rule of law and the legitimacy of Governments. The members of the Ad Hoc Committee had ample reason to be proud for having completed the negotiations, which had been arduous at times. He urged Governments to continue to demonstrate their commitment to making the convention a reality by participating in the High-level Political Signing Conference to be held in Merida, Mexico, in December 2003, in order to ensure a high number of signatories to the new convention.
