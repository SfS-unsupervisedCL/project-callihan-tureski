Letter dated 30 December 2009 from the President of the Security Council addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1646 (2005), adopted on 20 December 2005, in which the Council, in keeping with its resolution 1645 (2005), adopted on the same date, decided that the permanent members listed in Article 23, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations should be members of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Committee and that, in addition, the Council should annually select two of its elected members to participate in the Organizational Committee. I therefore have the honour to inform you that, following informal consultations on 29 December 2009, the members of the Security Council agreed on the selection of Gabon and Mexico as the two elected members of the Council to participate in the Organizational Committee for a term of one year, until the end of 2010. (Signed) Michel Kafando President of the Security Council
