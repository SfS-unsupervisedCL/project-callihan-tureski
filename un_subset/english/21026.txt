Fifty-seventh session Agenda item 150 Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic Final performance report of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic * The present report was delayed owing to internal consultations. Report of the Secretary-General* 1. The United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1159 (1998) of 27 March 1998 for an initial period of three months with effect from 15 April 1998. The mandate entrusted to the Mission under the terms of the resolution consisted of assisting in maintaining and enhancing security and stability in Bangui and its immediate environs as well as maintaining law and order. The Mission also had to supervise, control storage and monitor the final disposition of all weapons collected during the disarmament programme. MINURCA was also charged with ensuring the security and freedom of movement of United Nations personnel and the safety and security of United Nations property. In addition, it was charged with the responsibility of providing assistance in coordination with other international efforts in a short-term police trainers programme and in capacity-building efforts of the national police, and advice on the restructuring of the national police and special police forces along with advice and technical support to the national electoral process. 2. By its resolution 1271 (1999) of 22 October 1999, the Security Council extended the mandate of MINURCA until 15 February 2000 with a view to ensuring a short and gradual transition from United Nations peacekeeping involvement in the Central African Republic to a post-conflict peace-building presence in conjunction with the relevant United Nations agencies and programmes. Liquidation 3. The requirements for the liquidation of the Mission were contained in document A/54/857 of 4 May 2000. The liquidation was completed by 30 June 2000. In addition, provisions were made for a short period for residual liquidation activities in New York. Disposition of assets 4. Information on the disposition of the assets of MINURCA was contained in the report of the Secretary-General dated 29 November 2002 (A/57/631). The General Assembly has been requested to take note of the report. II. Financial performance report 5. As shown in table 1 below, income to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic derived from assessed contributions totalled $123,075,000. The total assessed contributions had been fully appropriated by the General Assembly for the operation of the Mission. 6. Expenditure amounted to $121,423,000 and was partially offset by $4,657,000 of savings on or cancellation of prior period obligations, thereby resulting in net expenditure of $116,766,000. The unencumbered balance realized by the Mission amounted to $6,309,000, of which $6,284,000 in credits were returned to Member States, which resulted in a balance of appropriations of $25,000. 7. The total expenditure for the Mission includes $106,000 incurred against the amount of $119,726 appropriated under the terms of General Assembly resolution 54/277 of 15 June 2000, in connection with the completion of residual liquidation tasks at United Nations Headquarters during the 2000-2001 financial period. However, that appropriated amount was not assessed on Member States. The related expenditure was charged to the Mission's fund balance, therefore no additional assessment is required.

The assets of MINURCA as at 30 June 2002 comprised $35,978,000 in uncollected assessments and other receivables, which were partially offset by a cash deficit of $29,742,000. The cash deficit can only be liquidated once the outstanding receivables have been paid. III. Action to be taken by the General Assembly 10. The Secretary-General recommends that the provisions of financial regulations 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 be suspended in respect of the liabilities and fund balance of $36,253,000 in light of the cash shortage of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic.
