the ongoing adverse impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and challenges posed by climate change, Stressing that addressing Africa's special development needs should be given due attention in the elaboration of the post2015 development agenda, Noting that Africa is abundantly endowed with natural resources, including many industrial minerals and agricultural resources that are exported mainly in primary form, and that the exploitation of the natural resources sector in Africa has for many years attracted foreign direct investment in capitalintensive enclave sectors that has the potential, when paired with appropriate policies, including employment-intensive policies, to spur structural transformation, create employment, contribute to poverty eradication and reduce inequality, Emphasizing that the African Union and the regional economic communities have a critical role to play in the implementation of the New

of the African Union Commission and the United Nations as the co-organizers of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development, Recognizing further that investments in people, especially their social protection, health and education, are essential to enhancing agricultural productivity and performance, and thereby key to growth and poverty reduction, through increasing decent job creation and employability opportunities, especially for women and youth, improving food security and nutrition and building resilience, Noting with appreciation that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and bilateral donors have provided substantial debt relief to 35 countries that have reached the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which has considerably reduced their debt vulnerability and enabled them to increase their investments in social services, Bearing in mind that African countries have primary responsibility for their own economic and social development, that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized and that the development efforts of such countries need to be supported by an enabling international economic environment, and in this regard recalling the support given by the International Conference on Financing for Development to the New Partnership, 1.

Further emphasizes that the increasingly unacceptable high levels of poverty, inequality and social exclusion faced by most African countries require a comprehensive approach to the development and implementation of social and economic policies, inter alia, to reduce poverty, to promote economic activity, growth and sustainable development in order to ensure employment creation and decent work for all, to promote education, health and social protection and to enhance equality, social inclusion, political stability, democracy and good governance at all levels and the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 13.

Underlines the fact that the fulfilment of all official development assistance commitments is crucial, including the commitments by many developed countries to achieve the target of allocating 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance to developing countries by 2015 and the target of allocating between 0.15 and 0.20 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance to the least developed countries, and urges developed countries that have not yet done so to fulfil their commitments for official development assistance to developing countries; 17.

Recognizes that, while social development is primarily the responsibility of Governments, international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full achievement of that goal; 19.

Underlines the importance for African Governments to build the productive capacity of agriculture, as a top priority, in order to increase rural incomes and ensure access to food for net food buyers, and stresses that greater efforts should be made to promote and implement sustainable agriculture, increase access for smallholder farmers, in particular women, to necessary agricultural resources, including productive assets, and improve access to infrastructure, information and markets, and that, furthermore, efforts should be made to promote small and medium-sized enterprises that contribute to job growth and increase incomes along the agricultural value stream; 24.

Recognizes the need for Africa's development partners that are supporting agriculture and food security in Africa to align their efforts more specifically towards supporting the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, using the Programme's investment plans for alignment of external funding, and in this regard takes note of the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security; 27. Also recognizes that the implementation of the commitments made by Governments during the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997 - 2006) has fallen short of expectations, and welcomes the proclamation of the Second Decade (2008 - 2017) by the General Assembly in its resolution 62/205 of 19 December 2007 in order to support, in an efficient and coordinated manner, the internationally agreed development goals related to poverty eradication, including the Millennium Development Goals; 28.
