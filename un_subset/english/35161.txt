General Assembly Sixtieth session Agenda item 14 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Sixty-first year Identical letters dated 15 August 2006 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government, and with reference to my previous letters on the continuous Israeli aggression against Lebanon and its people, I regret to inform you that on 13 August 2006 the Israeli air force targeted the Al-Imam Hassan residential complex in the Al-Rouyess district of southern Beirut. The Israeli air strike led to the destruction of the residential complex, which collapsed on the heads of its civilian dwellers and thereby killed 15 people, most of whom were children. This new massacre, which followed those in Qana, Al-Qa'a, and Chiyyah, was deliberately perpetrated by the Israeli forces. It represents a blatant violation of international law, including humanitarian and human rights laws, in particular the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 14, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Caroline Ziade Chargé d'affaires a.i.
