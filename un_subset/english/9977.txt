UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/467 22 April 1999 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: ARABIC LETTER DATED 22 APRIL 1999 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to inform you as follows: 1. On the night of 5/6 April 1999 a Kuwaiti patrol in the Khawr Abd Allah area near Mina' al-Bakr intercepted Iraqi craft No. 29/Basrah, with Nuri Ibrahim Ahmad at the wheel, while it was engaged in fishing. The patrol crew searched the craft, confiscated the compass and took away the fishing permits belonging to the nine fishermen on board. A shot was fired at the craft, and the window of the wheelhouse was broken. 2. On 6 April 1999 a Kuwaiti patrol in the Khawr Abd Allah area inside Iraqi territorial waters intercepted Iraqi craft No. 14/Basrah, belonging to Abd al-Amir Khudayr Sultan, and took away the fishing permits of the 13 fishermen present as well as the customs carnet. 3. On 6 April 1999 a Kuwaiti patrol in the area of the buoys intercepted the Iraqi craft Nisrin (No. 135/Basrah), with Hafiz Abbas Jum`ah at the wheel, while it was engaged in fishing. The patrol crew searched the craft and took the fishing permits belonging to the eight fishermen. 4. At 1630 hours on 6 April 1999 Iraqi craft No. 73, belonging to Abd al-Amir Abd Ali Fadl, was searched by a Kuwaiti patrol boat as it was fishing inside Iraqi territorial waters. The patrol-boat crew searched the Iraqi craft and confiscated and threw into the sea the fishing permits belonging to the fishermen. I request you to intervene with the Government of Kuwait with a view to halting violations and provocative and unwarranted actions that have recently become more frequent, given that they are in breach of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law and that they pose a threat to the security and sovereignty of a member State of the United Nations. I also affirm Iraq's legally established right, in accordance with the principle of State responsibility, to seek compensation for the damage done to its citizens and their property by these acts of aggression. I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Saeed H. HASAN Ambassador Permanent Representative
