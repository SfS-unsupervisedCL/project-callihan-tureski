Declaration, the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction and the measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world drug problem, Gravely concerned that the drug problem, despite increasing efforts by States, relevant international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, is still a challenge of global dimensions, which constitutes a serious threat to the health, safety and well-being of all humankind, in particular young people, Gravely concerned also that the demand for, production of and trafficking in illicit drugs and psychotropic substances undermines development, including efforts to reduce poverty, entails an increasing economic cost for Governments and continues to seriously threaten socio-economic and political systems, democratic institutions, and the stability, national security and sovereignty of States, especially those involved in conflicts and wars, and that trafficking in drugs makes conflict resolution more difficult, Deeply alarmed by the violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug-trafficking and other criminal activities, such as money-laundering and illicit traffic in arms, precursors and essential chemicals, and by the increasing transnational links between them, and recognizing the urgent need for enhanced international cooperation and implementation of effective strategies on the basis of the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, which are essential to achieving results against all forms of transnational criminal activities, Noting with grave concern the rapid and widespread increase, and the involvement of minors, in the

assessment of the progress achieved and the difficulties encountered in meeting the goals and targets set out in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session, Emphasizing the importance of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction, which introduces a new global approach balanced

Alternative Development, which recognizes the importance of supply reduction as an integral part of a balanced drug control strategy, Recognizing the efforts of all countries, in particular those that produce narcotic drugs for scientific and medical purposes, and of the International Narcotics Control Board in preventing the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and in maintaining production at a level consistent with licit demand, in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of l961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, Recognizing also that the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is often related to the economic development level of countries and that appropriate measures are required, based on the principle of shared responsibility and strengthened international cooperation, in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production, Expressing its concern that lenient policies towards the use of illicit drugs that are not in accordance with the international drug control treaties may hamper the efforts of the international community to address the world drug problem, and recalling in this context the importance of complying with relevant international obligations, Welcoming the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted on 27 June 2001 at the special session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS, including the acknowledgement of the

world drug problem, through their involvement in all stages of programmes and policy-making, Recognizing that the use of new technologies and electronic media, including the Internet, poses new opportunities for and challenges to international cooperation in countering drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking, Convinced that civil society, including non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, plays an active role and makes an effective contribution to countering the world drug problem, and should be encouraged to continue to do so, Acknowledging that
