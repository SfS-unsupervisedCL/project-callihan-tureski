Substantive session of 2010 New York, 28 June-22 July 2010 * E/2010/100. Item 2 (c) of the provisional agenda* High-level segment: annual ministerial review: implementing the internationally agreed goals and commitments in regard to gender equality and empowerment of women Statement submitted by Family Welfare in Brazil Civil Society, a non-governmental organization in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council The Secretary-General has received the following statement, which is being circulated in accordance with paragraphs 30 and 31 of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31. Family Welfare in Brazil Civil Society, a Brazilian non-governmental organization dedicated to defending and promoting social, socio-environmental, sexual and reproductive, and individual and collective rights, and to contributing to social development and health improvement since 1965, works to increase the access of all people, particularly the poorest, the marginalized and those without assistance, to sexual and reproductive health services. The organization understands that the Cairo Plan of Action, the Beijing Platform for Action and the Millennium Development Goals redefine the universal need for access to reproductive health services based on the concept of human rights and take into account the more comprehensive issues related to population, the environment and consumption patterns, the family, internal and international migration, the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, information, education and communication, technology, research and development. On the other hand, the Plan, Platform and Goals are not enough with respect to sexual and reproductive rights specifically, gender relations must be addressed; otherwise, the inequalities will maintain the state of vulnerability of women, especially young ones. The Millennium Development Goals identify social inequality as one of the most difficult challenges that humanity faces; women still suffer from discrimination and gender-based violence and are the main victims of exclusion at different levels and in different spheres. Considering the need to emphasize social development as a vehicle for reducing inequalities and for taking care of the necessities of the least favoured and most vulnerable members of our societies, we call upon all members of the international community, Governments, civil society and international agencies to prioritize efforts to guarantee equality of opportunity, regardless of gender, race, ethnic group, ideology, religion or sexual orientation, as a form of contributing to the reduction of poverty, and to promote the socio-economic and environmental development needed to improve quality of life. The organization exhorts the States Members of the United Nations to implement the following recommendations: :: Promote gender equality through social services, including education and health services :: Strengthen integrated policies for the reduction of maternal morbidity :: Extend universal access to contraceptive methods :: Ensure universal access to the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis :: Guarantee policies and integrated services designed to attend the needs of adolescents and youth :: Create and strengthen permanent dialogues and joint decision-making between Governments and civil society
