A/AC.252/1999/WP.46 22 March 1999 Original: English Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996 Third session 15–26 March 1999 Proposal submitted by Guatemala Article 5, paragraph 1 (A/AC.252/1999/WP.23) Replace the existing text by the following: “1. To the extent that its fundamental legal principles and international law allow it to do so, each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that legal entities other than States can be held liable or sanctioned whenever they have, with the full knowledge of one or more persons responsible for their management or control, derived profits from or participated in the commission of offences referred to in this Convention.” Explanatory comments It would seem that the text of paragraph 1 of article 5 proposed in A/AC.252/L.7 does not spell out with sufficient precision and comprehensiveness the cases where a State party is under an obligation to take action under the paragraph. In A/AC.252/1999/WP.23 we sought to remedy this by spelling out those cases. We have now realized, however, that the enumeration of the latter contained in that working paper was not complete and could also raise some difficulties. Instead of trying to rectify this, we have, in this new proposal, adopted an entirely different and far simpler approach, namely, to provide simply that a State party is under an obligation to take action under paragraph 1 whenever it is in a position lawfully and properly to do so. This would cover all cases where the legal entity that misbehaves has links sufficiently close to the territory or authorities of the State party to enable it to do something about the misconduct. The words “other than States” would appear to render paragraph 5 of article 5 unnecessary. (Moreover, in the text of paragraph 1 we are proposing corrections to some mistakes contained in the English translation of that paragraph.)
