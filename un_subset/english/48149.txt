In paragraph 22 of its resolution 1240 (XIII) B of 14 October 1958 on the establishment of the Special Fund, the General Assembly provided that the Secretary-General, after consulting the Governing Council of the Special Fund, would appoint the Managing Director, subject to confirmation by the Assembly. That procedure has been construed as applying also to the appointment of the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2. Following consultations with members of the Executive Board of UNDP, the Secretary-General wishes to request the General Assembly to confirm the appointment of Helen Clark of New Zealand as Administrator of UNDP for a four-year term of office beginning on 20 April 2009.
