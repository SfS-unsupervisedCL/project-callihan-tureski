The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Logistics Base (UNLB) at Brindisi, Italy, for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 18 December 2002 (A/57/670) and amounted to $23,262,900 gross ($22,004,400 net). It provided for 37 international staff and 99 national staff. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in paragraph 27 of its report dated 3 April 2003 (A/57/772/Add.9), recommended that the General Assembly appropriate $22,208,100 gross for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. 2. The General Assembly, by its resolution 57/320 of 18 June 2003, appropriated an amount of $22,208,100 gross ($20,949,600 net) for the maintenance of the Logistics Base for the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance 3. The United Nations Logistics Base has been in operation since late 1994 under a rent-free arrangement with the Republic of Italy. The memorandum of understanding regarding the use of the facilities by the United Nations was signed by the Secretary-General and the Republic of Italy on 23 November 1994 and amended on 7 December 2001. 4. The Logistics Base is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to ensure effective and efficient peacekeeping operations. 5. Within this overall objective, the Logistics Base has, during the performance report period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the framework below. This framework has been presented along six programmatic lines, namely, maintenance of assets and facilities, supply and warehousing, communications and information technology, training, air operations and administration. 6. The 2003/04 period is the first period for which the Logistics Base was able to assess its performance against the planned results-based framework set out in the 2003/04 budget. The performance report compares the actual indicators of achievement, the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement, and compares the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs.

Additional requirements were due mainly to high turnover of international staff assigned to Brindisi, resulting in increased costs associated with assignment and repatriation. In addition, post adjustment increased each subsequent month from 19.3 per cent in July 2003 to 31 per cent in June 2004. 8. Additional requirements were due mainly to salary revision, resulting in a 2.9 per cent increase retroactive from 1 July 2003 and the appreciation of the euro as compared to the United States dollar during the financial period. 9. Reduced requirements were due mainly to reduced costs of consultancy services, as architects were hired on individual contracts instead of using consultancy contracts with firms. 10. Reduced requirements were due mainly to the start-up of new and expanding missions which required staff members to remain at the Base, resulting in the cancellation of planned travel. 11. Reduced requirements were due mainly to the cancellation of three projects for the renovation and alteration of buildings because of the delay in approval from authorities. 12. Reduced requirements were mainly under repair and maintenance owing to a delay in the arrival of the strategic deployment stocks vehicles. Moreover, the delivery of strategic deployment stocks vehicles directly to the missions resulted in reduced requirements to support and preserve the anticipated strategic deployment stocks fleet of 1,190 vehicles. 13. Reduced requirements were mainly under equipment maintenance owing to the launching of new missions and the slower than expected arrival of strategic deployment stocks replenishment stocks leading to a reduction in the cost of maintaining strategic deployment stocks communications equipment. 14. Reduced requirements were mainly under repair and maintenance owing to the launching of new missions and the slower than expected arrival of strategic deployment stocks replenishment stocks, leading to a reduction in maintenance and repair costs of information technology equipment. 15. Reduced requirements were due to the delayed signing of a contract for warehouse rental, inventory management and equipment maintenance of the medical component of strategic deployment stocks to be based in Germany. 16. Reduced requirements were mainly under training fees, supplies and services owing to the start-up of new missions, which required staff members to remain at the base, resulting in the cancellation of planned training events for UNLB staff. 17. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNLB are: (a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $149,000 with respect to the period from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004; (b) To decide on the treatment of other income/adjustments for the period ended 30 June 2004 amounting to $2,292,000 from interest income ($1,382,000), other/miscellaneous income ($668,000) and savings on or cancellation of prior-period obligations ($242,000).
