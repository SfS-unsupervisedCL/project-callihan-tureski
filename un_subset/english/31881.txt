Sixtieth session Fifth Committee Agenda item 127 Pattern of conferences Letter dated 12 October 2005 from the President of the General Assembly addressed to the Chairman of the Fifth Committee I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, for consideration by the Fifth Committee, a letter dated 4 October 2005 from the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences concerning meeting the needs of persons with disabilities. (Signed) Jan Eliasson Letter dated 4 October 2005 from the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences addressed to the President of the General Assembly The Committee on Conferences at its substantive session held from 19 to 27 September 2005 considered a letter from the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee on a Comprehensive and Integral International Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities requesting the Committee's assistance in ensuring that delegates with disabilities could participate meaningfully and on an equal basis with others in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee. The Committee was addressed by the Secretary of the Ad Hoc Committee who stated that the most urgent need was for official documentation relating to the work of the Ad Hoc Committee to be made available in both electronic format and Braille. The Committee considered the above issues favourably and expressed support for meeting the needs of the persons with disabilities involved in the elaboration of the draft convention. It urged the Secretariat to continue ensuring, as it did in past years, that the special requirements of the Ad Hoc Committee were taken into account in conference room scheduling and to explore ways of providing the required documentation in electronic form and Braille. The Committee entrusted me to convey to you that it considered the above-mentioned issues favourably and suggested that the General Assembly consider them on a priority basis, both in the particular case of making available the requested documentation in Braille and in terms of the larger issue of the access of persons with disabilities to conference services. (Signed) Diego Simancas Chairman Committee on Conferences
