Sixty-first session Agenda item 123 Human resources management Letter dated 7 May 2007 from the Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General In my capacity as Chair of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement, I have the honour to enclose herewith the statement by the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement on the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions 61/256 and 61/257, adopted on Monday, 7 May 2007 (see annex). Furthermore, I kindly request that the above-mentioned document be circulated as a document of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 123. (Signed) Rodrigo Malmierca DÃ­az Ambassador Permanent Representative of Cuba to the United Nations Chair of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement Statement by the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement on the implementation of General Assembly resolutions 61/256 and 61/257 The Non-Aligned Movement participated directly, actively and constructively in the process of negotiation and agreement on the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to realign the Department for Peacekeeping Operations and the former Department for Disarmament Affairs. Historically and traditionally, members of the Non-Aligned Movement have played a key role in the field of United Nations peacekeeping operations and in the multilateral efforts to achieve progress in the field of disarmament. In this context, the Movement considers that the decisions taken by the General Assembly on the strengthening of the aforementioned Departments, should make an effective contribution and add new impetus to the work of the United Nations in the field of peacekeeping operations and disarmament. As is very well known, developing countries are not adequately represented at the high-level structure of the United Nations Secretariat. The Movement believes that the new posts of Under-Secretary-General for the Department of Field Support and the Office for Disarmament Affairs should be entrusted to individuals from developing countries.
