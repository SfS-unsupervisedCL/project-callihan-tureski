(Signed) Leonid A. SKOTNIKOV Ambassador Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the Conference on Disarmament GE.02-60012 (E) 030102 040102 STATEMENT BY THE OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION REGARDING THE END OF THE PERIOD OF STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS REDUCTIONS UNDER THE START TREATY 5 December 2001 The period of strategic offensive arms reductions under the Treaty on Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START-1 Treaty), to which the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine - the Soviet successor States - and the United States of America are parties, ended on 5 December. Under this Treaty, the parties undertook by seven years after its entry into force to have reduced the number of their strategic delivery vehicles to 1,600, and the number of warheads attributed to them to 6,000 each, and to set other limits. The Russian side has fully honoured its commitment to those reductions and as of the control date of 5 December 2001 had actually reduced the number of its deployed strategic delivery vehicles (ICBMs, SLBMs and heavy bombers) to 1,136, and the number of warheads attributed to them to 5,518. We expect that the United States of America too will reach the reduction levels set by the Treaty. At the same time we have questions relating to the fulfilment of a number of obligations under this Treaty. We believe that these questions will be settled in the nearest future. A complete and timely implementation of the provisions of the START-1 Treaty creates a good basis for elaborating an agreement on further drastic reductions of strategic offensive arms, on which the Presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States agreed during their November summit.
