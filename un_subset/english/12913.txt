Letter dated 5 April 2000 from the Permanent Representative of Djibouti to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to transmit a letter to you dated 28 March 2000 from Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, President of Djibouti, concerning the Sudan (see annex). I would appreciate if the present letter and its annex could be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Roble Olhaye Ambassador Permanent Representative [Original: French] Letter dated 28 March 2000 from the President of Djibouti to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to inform you that we have learned that the Security Council will take up the question of peace in the Sudan this April. While we fully recognize and appreciate the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of peace and security at the international level and its involvement in the pacific settlement of conflicts, as current President of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the main forum for peace efforts in the Sudan, we should like to emphasize that taking up the question in the Security Council might have a negative impact on the peace process currently under way under the auspices of IGAD. As you know, IGAD has established a permanent secretariat, which has already organized two series of talks since its creation early this year. Preparations are also under way for the convening of a third series of talks in the very near future. It is our profound hope that the Security Council, in accordance with Article 52 (on regional arrangements) of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, will do its utmost to give a chance to the laudable efforts undertaken by IGAD for the resolution of the conflict in the Sudan. (Signed) Ismaïl Omar Guelleh
