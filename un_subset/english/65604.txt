especially resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008), 1846 (2008), 1851 (2008), 1897 (2009), 1918 (2010), 1950 (2010), 1976 (2011), 2015 (2011), and 2020 (2011), as well as the Statement of its President (S/PRST/2010/16) of 25 August 2010, Continuing to be gravely concerned by the ongoing threat that piracy and armed robbery at sea against vessels pose to the prompt, safe, and effective delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia and the region, to the safety of seafarers and other persons, to international navigation and the safety of commercial maritime routes, and to other vulnerable ships, including fishing activities in conformity with international law, and also gravely concerned by the extended range of the piracy threat into the western Indian Ocean and adjacent sea areas and the increase in pirate capacities, Expressing concern about the reported involvement of children in piracy off the coast of Somalia, Recognizing that the ongoing instability in Somalia contributes to the problem of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and stressing the need for a comprehensive response by the international community to repress piracy and armed robbery at sea and tackle its underlying causes, Recognizing the need to investigate and prosecute not only suspects captured at sea, but also anyone who incites or intentionally facilitates piracy operations, including key figures of criminal networks involved in piracy who illicitly plan, organize, facilitate, or finance and profit from such attacks, and reiterating its concern over persons suspected of piracy having to be released without facing justice, reaffirming that the failure to prosecute persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia undermines anti-piracy efforts of the international community and being determined to create conditions to ensure that pirates are held accountable, Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, including Somalia's rights with respect to offshore natural resources, including fisheries, in accordance with international law, recalling the importance of preventing, in accordance with international law, illegal fishing and illegal dumping, including of toxic substances, and stressing the need to investigate any new allegations of such illegal fishing and dumping; noting the report of the Secretary-General (S/2012/783), which acknowledges difficulty in providing detailed information related to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and dumping off Somalia's coast without adequate monitoring or reporting systems, and states that the United Nations has received little evidence to date to justify claims that illegal fishing and dumping are factors responsible for forcing Somali youths to resort to piracy, and that there is currently no evidence of toxic waste dumping on land and at sea; emphasizing that the concerns about protection of the marine environment as well as resources should not be allowed to mask the true nature of piracy off the coast of Somalia which is a transnational criminal enterprise driven primarily by the opportunity for financial gain, and expressing appreciation in this respect for the report of the Secretary-General on the protection of Somali natural resources and water (S/2011/661) prepared pursuant to paragraph 7 of Security Council Resolution 1976 (2011), Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 ("The Convention"), sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities, Underlining the primary responsibility of the Somali authorities in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast Somalia and noting the several requests from Somali authorities for international assistance to counter piracy off its coast, including the letter of 5 November 2012, from the Permanent Representative of Somalia to the United Nations expressing the appreciation of Somali authorities to the Security Council for its assistance, expressing their willingness to consider working with other States and regional organizations to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and requesting that the provisions of resolution 1897 (2009) be renewed for an additional twelve months, Commending the efforts of the European Union operation ATALANTA, North Atlantic Treaty Organization operations Allied Protector and Ocean Shield, Combined Maritime Forces' Combined Task Force 151 commanded by Denmark, New Zealand, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Turkey, Thailand and the United States, and other States acting in a national capacity in cooperation with Somali authorities and each other, to suppress piracy and to protect vulnerable ships transiting through the waters off the coast of Somalia, and welcoming the efforts of individual countries, including China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation, which have deployed ships and/or aircraft in the region, as stated in the Secretary-General's report (S/2012/783), Commending the efforts of flag States for taking appropriate measures to permit vessels sailing under their flag transiting the High Risk Area to embark vessel protection detachments and privately contracted armed security personnel, and encouraging States to regulate such activities in accordance with applicable international law and permit charters to favour arrangements that make use of such measures, Notes the request of some Member States on the need to review the boundaries of the High Risk Area on an objective and transparent basis taking into account actual incidents of piracy, noting that the High Risk Area is set and defined by the insurance and maritime industry, Welcoming the capacity building efforts in the region made through the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Djibouti Code of Conduct Trust Fund and the Trust Fund Supporting Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, as well as the European Union's planned programming under EUCAP NESTOR, and recognizing the need for all engaged international and regional organizations to cooperate fully, Noting with appreciation the efforts made by the IMO and the shipping industry to develop and update guidance, best management practices, and recommendations to assist ships to prevent and suppress piracy attacks off the coast of Somalia, including in the Gulf of Aden, and the Indian Ocean area, and recognizing the work of the IMO, and the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS); in this regard, notes the efforts of the International Organization for Standardization, which has developed industry standards of training and certification for Private Maritime Security Companies when providing privately contracted armed security personnel on board ships in high-risk areas, Noting with concern that the continuing limited capacity and domestic legislation to facilitate the custody and prosecution of suspected pirates after their capture has hindered more robust international action against the pirates off the coast of Somalia, too often has led to pirates being released without facing justice, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution and reiterating that, consistent with the provisions of the Convention concerning the repression of piracy, the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation ("SUA Convention") provides for parties to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or threat thereof or any other form of intimidation, Underlining the importance of continuing to enhance the collection, preservation and transmission to competent authorities of evidence of acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the

importance for the successful prosecution of acts of piracy of enabling seafarers to give evidence in criminal proceedings, Further recognizing that pirate networks continue to rely on kidnapping and hostage-taking, and that these activities help generate funding to purchase weapons, gain recruits, and continue their operational activities, thereby jeopardizing the safety and security of innocent civilians and restricting the flow of free commerce, and welcoming international efforts to collect and share information to disrupt the pirate enterprise, as exemplified by INTERPOL's Global Database on Maritime Piracy; and noting the ongoing initiative aimed at establishing the Regional AntiPiracy Prosecution & Intelligence Coordination Centre, hosted by the Republic of Seychelles, Reaffirming international condemnation of acts of kidnapping and hostage-taking, including offences contained within the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, and strongly condemning the continuing practice of hostage-taking by pirates operating off the coast of Somalia, expressing serious concern at the inhuman conditions hostages face in captivity, recognizing the adverse impact on their families, calling for the immediate release of all hostages, and noting the importance of cooperation between Member States on the issue of hostage-taking and the prosecution of suspected pirates for taking hostages, Commending the Kenya and the Seychelles' efforts to prosecute suspected pirates in their national courts, welcoming and looking forward to further engagement of Mauritius and Tanzania, and noting with appreciation the assistance being provided by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Trust Fund Supporting Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, and other international organizations and donors, in coordination with the CGPCS, to support Kenya, Seychelles, Somalia, and other States in the region to take steps to prosecute, or incarcerate in a third State after prosecution elsewhere, pirates, including facilitators and financiers ashore, consistent with applicable international human rights law, and emphasizing the need for States and international organizations to further enhance international efforts in this regard, Welcoming the readiness of the national and regional administrations of Somalia to cooperate with each other and with States who have prosecuted suspected pirates with a view to enabling convicted pirates to be repatriated back to Somalia under suitable prisoner transfer arrangements, consistent with applicable international law including international human rights law, Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General (S/2012/783), as requested by resolution 2020 (2011), on the implementation of that resolution and on the situation with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, Taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Secretary-General on the modalities for the establishment of specialized Somali anti-piracy courts (S/2011/360 and S/2012/50), prepared pursuant to paragraph 26 of resolution 1976 (2011) and paragraph 16 of resolution 2015 (2011), and the ongoing efforts within the CGPCS and the United Nations Secretariat to explore possible additional mechanisms to effectively prosecute persons suspected of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, including those ashore who incite or intentionally facilitate acts of piracy, Stressing the need for States to consider possible methods to assist the seafarers who are victims of pirates, and welcoming in this regard the ongoing work within the CGPCS and the IMO on developing guidelines for the care of seafarers and other persons who have been subjected to acts of piracy, Recognizing the progress made by the CGPCS, UNODC, and UNPOS in the use of public information tools to raise awareness of the dangers of piracy, highlight the best practices to eradicate this criminal phenomenon, and inform the public of the dangers posed by piracy, Further noting with appreciation the ongoing efforts by UNODC and UNDP to support efforts to enhance the capacity of the corrections system in Somalia, including regional authorities notably with the support of the Trust Fund Supporting Initiatives of States Countering Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, to incarcerate convicted pirates consistent with applicable international human rights law, Bearing in mind the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, noting the operations of the newly established information sharing centres in Yemen, Kenya and Tanzania and the ongoing work regarding a regional maritime training centre in Djibouti, and recognizing the efforts of signatory States, including new signatory States South Africa and Mozambique, to develop the appropriate regulatory and legislative frameworks to combat piracy, enhance their capacity to patrol the waters of the region, interdict suspect vessels, and prosecute suspected pirates, Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of State institutions, economic and social development and respect for human rights and the rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a durable eradication of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and further emphasizing that Somalia's long-term security rests with the effective development by Somali authorities of the Somali National Security Forces, Welcoming in this regard the election of the President on 10 September and the subsequent appointment of a Prime Minister and Cabinet, considering that this represents the completion of the Transition in Somalia and an important milestone in Somalia's path to more stable and accountable governance, Noting that the joint counterpiracy efforts of the international community and private sector have resulted in a sharp decline in pirate attacks as well as hijackings since 2011 and emphasizing that without further action, the significant progress made in reducing the number of successful pirate attacks is reversible, Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia exacerbate the situation in Somalia, which continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region, Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 1. Reiterates that it condemns and deplores all acts of piracy and armed robbery against vessels in the waters off the coast of Somalia; 2.

Recognizes the need for States, regional organizations, and other appropriate partners to exchange evidence and information with a view to the arrest and prosecution of key figures of criminal networks involved in piracy who illicitly plan, organize, facilitate, or finance and profit from piracy operations, and keeps under review the possibility of applying targeted sanctions against such individuals or entities if they meet the listing criteria set out in paragraph 8 resolution 1844 (2008); 10. Renews its call upon States and regional organizations that have the capacity to do so, to take part in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, in particular, consistent with this resolution and international law, by deploying naval vessels, arms and military aircraft and through seizures and disposition of boats, vessels, arms and other related equipment used in the commission of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, or for which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting such use; 11.
