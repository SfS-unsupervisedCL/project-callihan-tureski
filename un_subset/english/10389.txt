UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/918 27 August 1999 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 24 AUGUST 1999 FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1260 (1999) of 20 August 1999, by which the Council authorized the provisional expansion of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) up to 210 military observers, along with the necessary equipment and administrative and medical support to perform the tasks set out in paragraph 38 of the seventh report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (S/1999/836), and decided that the additional military observers should be deployed as security conditions permit and should operate for the time being under security provided by the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), as indicated in paragraph 39 of the report. The countries currently contributing military observers to UNOMSIL are listed in the annex to document S/1999/836. Following the usual consultations, I propose that Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Indonesia, Nepal, Norway, Sweden, Thailand, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uruguay be added to the list of countries contributing military personnel to the Observer Mission. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Kofi A. ANNAN
