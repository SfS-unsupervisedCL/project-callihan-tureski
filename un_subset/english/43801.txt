Based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in its reports on the financing of UNOCI (A/60/896, para. 52, and A/61/551, para. 14), the General Assembly, by its resolutions 60/17 B and 61/247, appropriated a total amount of $472,889,300 gross ($464,869,200 net) for the maintenance of the mission for 2006/07. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance 3. The mandate of UNOCI was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1528 (2004) for an initial period of 12 months as from 4 April 2004. The mandate for the performance period was provided by the Council in its resolutions 1652 (2006), 1682 (2006), 1726 (2006) and 1739 (2007). By its resolution 1682 (2006), the Council authorized an increase in the Operation's strength of up to 1,500 additional personnel, including a maximum of 1,025 military personnel and 475 police personnel. In its resolution 1739 (2007), the Council extended the mandate of UNOCI until 30 June 2007 and decided that the mandate of the Operation would be as described in paragraph 2 of the resolution. 4. The Operation is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to restore normalcy and overall security in Côte d'Ivoire. 5. Within this overall objective, the Operation has, during the reporting period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below for the ceasefire; disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement; humanitarian and human rights; peace process; law and order; and support components. 6. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based budgeting frameworks set out in the 2006/07 budgets. In particular, the report compares the actual indicators of achievement, that is, the extent to which progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement, and the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs. Expected accomplishment 1.1: stabilization of security conditions in Côte d'Ivoire Planned indicators of achievement Actual indicators of achievement No violations of the comprehensive ceasefire agreement of 3 May 2003 (2004/05: 2; 2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 0) Achieved. No violations of the comprehensive ceasefire agreement of 3 May 2003 Establishment of a restructured and reformed FANCI (Forces armées nationales de Côte d'Ivoire) in accordance with the Linas-Marcoussis, Accra III and Pretoria Agreements In accordance with the Ouagadougou Peace Agreement signed on 4 March 2007, the two forces, Forces nouvelles and the national defence and security forces, will be merged into a new integrated Ivorian defence force. During a meeting held on 23 April 2007, the Minister of Defence decided to create a commission dealing with the attribution of ranks in the future defence forces. The Government's objective was to merge the two forces, then to reduce their strength progressively by incentive measures No reports of armed groups non-signatories to the comprehensive ceasefire agreement of 3 May 2003 threatening the civilian population (2004/05: 3; 2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 0) Achieved. No reports of armed groups non-signatories to the comprehensive ceasefire agreement of 3 May 2003 threatening the civilian population Full compliance by Ivorian parties and neighbouring States with the arms embargo (2004/05: 2 incidents of non-compliance; 2005/06: 0 incidents; 2006/07: 0 incidents) Achieved. No incidents of non-compliance reported Planned outputs Completed (number or yes/no) Remarks 525,600 mobile and foot troop patrol days (20 troops per patrol x 2 patrols per company x 36 companies x 365 days) Sector West: 15 troops per patrol x 22,301 patrols; Sector East: 15 troops per patrol x 13,611 patrols; and Abidjan: 15 troops per patrol x 1,460 patrols The change in number of patrols was due to the change in situation in Sector West. The aim was to intensify the presence of UNOCI in the ex-zone of confidence 273,750 troop security/control person days (25 troops per checkpoint x 3 checkpoints per battalion x 10 battalions x 365 days) 18 checkpoints were activated, representing 98,550 security/control person days in Sector West and 73,365 in Sector East Only battalions deployed in the ex-zone of confidence were manning checkpoints, with the remaining checkpoints deactivated 2,880 air patrol hours (6 helicopters x 40 hours/helicopter x 12 months) 178 air patrol hours (3 helicopters x 6.59 hours/helicopter x 9 months) The lower than planned number of air patrol hours resulted from the improved security situation 37,230 military observers mobile patrol person days (2 military observers per patrol x 3 patrols x 17 team sites x 365 days) in Sectors East and West The dismantling of zone of confidence resulted in a decrease in the number of patrols with 3 military observers per patrol x 4,949 patrols conducted in Sector West and 3 military observers per patrol x 5,870 patrols conducted in Sector East 730 boat patrol days, including on the Abidjan Ébrié Lagoon, and emergency evacuation (2 boats x 365 days) 2 boats x 10 patrols x 26 weeks, as required No emergency evacuation was required 12 reports to the Côte d'Ivoire Sanctions Committee and the Security Council on compliance with the arms embargo Reports issued to the Côte d'Ivoire Sanctions Committee and the Security Council on compliance with the arms embargo Organization and conduct of an average of 7 weekly inspections of the cargo on board aircraft and transport vehicles at 2 seaports, 3 airports, 4 airfields, 10 military bases and 5 border crossings Monthly inspections at 2 seaports, 3 airports, 6 airfields, 14 military bases and 5 border crossings. Increased number of inspections at military bases and airfields attributable to operational requirements Participation in 12 meetings by the Force Commander on regional and inter-mission cooperation, including with Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) defence and security committees, United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL), United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), UNOCI and the United Nations Office for West Africa focused on containing cross-border movement of armed groups and operations against illegal movement of weapons Meetings Regular meetings with FANCI to advise on monitoring the borders, with particular attention to the situation of Liberian refugees and to the movement of combatants Yes Monthly meetings with the Forces de défense et de sécurité de Côte d'Ivoire/Centre de préparation et de conduite des opérations and weekly meetings at sector and battalion level Daily liaison with FANCI and the military elements of the Forces nouvelles to promote trust and confidence between all the Ivorian forces, including United Nations-Ivorian police/military joint patrols in Abidjan as well as in the zone of confidence Average of 3 liaison conferences per day, 5 days per week Organization of monthly meetings of the Quadripartite Commission and weekly tripartite meetings on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement No Owing to the decision of Forces nouvelles in August 2006 to stop the dialogue with the Government Regular advice to FANCI and Forces nouvelles on their military responsibilities under the Linas-Marcoussis, Accra III and Pretoria Agreements, including on development of operational guidelines On average, 3 meetings per week for a total of 156 meetings 75,190 troop security person days for the close protection of the ministers of the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and other major political leaders (206 troops x 365 days) Troop security person days 29,600 mobile and foot troop patrol days (20 troops per patrol x 2 patrols per company x 4 companies x 185 days) Patrol days (30 troops per patrol x 8 patrols per day x 185 days) 13,875 troop security/control person days (25 troops per checkpoint x 3 checkpoints per battalion x 1 battalion x 185 days) Troop security/control person days 13,505 troop security person days for the close protection of the ministers of the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and other major political leaders (73 troops x 185 days) Component 2: disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement progress towards reintegration of national ex-combatants and former militias into Côte d'Ivoire society; repatriation and resettlement of foreign ex-combatants present in Côte d'Ivoire, with special attention to the specific needs of women and children Reintegration, repatriation and resettlement of 48,064 foreign and national ex-combatants in Côte d'Ivoire, including 42,564 Forces nouvelles elements and 5,500 Government troops (2004/05: 0; 2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 48,064) The reintegration, repatriation and resettlement of foreign and national ex-combatants in Côte d'Ivoire did not occur owing to the delayed implementation of the Ouagadougou Peace Agreement, largely attributable to the slow implementation of the peace process prior to the Agreement. The parties were unable to meet the 23 April 2007 deadline regarding dismantling the militias and the cantonment of combatants, as these tasks required more detailed planning than envisaged in the Agreement Rehabilitation, reintegration and reunification with families of 3,000 former child soldiers (2004/05: 0; 2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 3,000) As at 30 June 2007, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) was assisting 1,200 children formerly associated with armed groups. The programme was conducted in collaboration with local partners, partner institutions and agencies such as the World Bank, the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UNOCI and covers Bouaké, Korhogo, Man, Danané and Logoualé. The International Rescue Committee, in collaboration with the International Committee of the Red Cross, Save the Children and UNICEF, was running programmes that benefit 500 self-demobilized ex-child soldiers in the Biankouma and Touba areas under the control of Forces armées des Forces nouvelles (FAFN). Among these children, 100 returned to school, while the remaining 400 were attending informal vocational training centres Reintegration of 2,000 former members of armed militias (2004/05: 0; 2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 2,000) The militias that were to take part in the disarmament and dismantling programme had been identified. Negotiations with some of these groups started in July 2006 and a first attempt at disarming militias started in Guiglo, in the western part of the country, on 26 July 2006. During this attempt the National Programme on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (PNDDR) registered 981 militia members who surrendered only 110 mostly unserviceable weapons and 6,975 assorted rounds of ammunition. This fell far below the weapons and ammunition per combatant ratio and the process was suspended on 4 August 2006 on account of the low number and the poor quality of the surrendered weapons. Of the 981 militia who took part in the first attempt of the programme, 500 have entered into a reintegration programme run by German Technical Cooperation and funded by the European Community, which is to serve as both a pilot project and a confidence-building measure Participation of 20,000 former members of unarmed militias in sustainable economic and development programmes administered by the National Programme on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration, UNDP and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (2004/05: 0; 2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 20,000) Not achieved, as the disarmament and demobilization of militias did not commence Advice to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire on establishment of a task force on the implementation of economic and development reintegration programmes for ex-combatants and former militia members, with special advice on the specific needs of women and children The task force was not established, as the disarmament and demobilization did not commence.

Financial resources Subtotal General temporary assistance Civilian electoral observers Consultants Official travel Special equipment Other supplies, services and equipment Quick-impact projects 7. The high level of expenditure in October 2006 was attributable mainly to the obligation of funds for the reimbursement of troop, formed police and contingent-owned equipment costs. Expenditures in June 2007 were attributable to the obligation of funds for the settlement of invoices and the finalization of purchase orders. C. Other income and adjustments (Thousands of United States dollars) Interest income Other/miscellaneous income Voluntary contributions in cash Prior-period adjustments Savings on or cancellation of prior-period obligations Total D.

Applicable to home country Incremental transportation factor E. Value of non-budgeted contributions Actual value Status-of-forces agreementa Voluntary contributions in kind (non-budgeted) a Includes Government-provided facilities. IV. Analysis of variances 8. Overexpenditure was due mainly to the lower actual delayed deployment factor of 3 per cent compared to a delayed deployment factor of 5 per cent used in the 2006/07 budget estimates. In addition, the increase in the mission subsistence allowance rate for the first 30 days from $140 to $191, with effect from 1 February 2007, contributed to the overexpenditure. 9. Increased requirements were due mainly to additional expenditure related to the reimbursement to troop-contributing countries for major equipment resulting from the replacement of an infantry contingent from one troop-contributing country by a contingent from another troop-contributing country. In addition, unbudgeted requirements for riot control equipment sets, demining equipment and support vehicles provided by troop-contributing countries contributed to the overexpenditure. 10. Savings were due mainly to the delayed deployment of police personnel, resulting in a lower number of rotation flights. The estimates included provision for 450 round-trip flights at an average cost of $5,500 while only 233 one-way trips were undertaken at an average cost of $4,140. 11. Savings were due mainly to the delayed deployment of formed police personnel, resulting in a lower number of rotation flights. The estimates included provision for 375 round-trip flights at an average cost of $5,500, while only 307 one-way trips were undertaken at an average cost of $4,140. 12. Savings were attributable mainly to a higher actual vacancy rate of 18.6 per cent as compared to a planned vacancy rate of 15 per cent used in the 2006/07 budget estimates. In addition, the suspension of the hazard duty station allowance, effective 16 May 2007, for Abidjan, Yamoussoukro, Daloa, Bouaké and San-Pédro contributed to savings. 13. The estimates included provision for the repatriation of 131 United Nations Volunteers in January 2007 upon the planned completion of the electoral process. However, as the elections were postponed, the Volunteers (Electoral Officers) were retained by the Operation pending announcement of the new election dates. 14. The revised 2006/07 budget estimates included provision for 4 international and 16 national staff in the Engineering Section for temporary assistance in the installation and maintenance of camps to accommodate the additional military and police personnel. However, as most of the reinforcement works were completed before the budget approval, the temporary positions were not filled, resulting in savings. 15. Savings were due mainly to the reduced requirements for mission subsistence allowance and travel on assignment/repatriation. 16. Savings were attributable mainly to reduced requirements for training consultants, as in-house expertise was used to conduct training in the area of movement control. 17. Overexpenditure was attributable mainly to increased requirements for travel of military, police and civilian personnel between eight regional sectors and mission headquarters owing to the continued volatile security situation; security restrictions on road trips after daylight hours, resulting in extended stays of personnel at each location; ongoing consultations regarding the peace process with United Nations Headquarters in New York, the international community and regional partners; and ongoing construction projects, such as hardwall accommodation for troops and the establishment of other mission facilities, resulting in a higher than expected number of trips within the mission area. 18. Savings were attributable primarily to the increased utilization of generators as the main source of electricity supply owing to the unreliability of locally supplied electricity, with frequent power fluctuations and shutdowns. 19. Savings were also attributable to the non-utilization of provisions for the acquisition of aviation fuel storage and distribution equipment intended for deployment to the northern part of the country in order to set up aviation fuel farms, as aviation fuel was available locally through contractual arrangements. 20. Further savings were realized owing to reduced requirements for maintenance services (delays in the finalization of contract for the maintenance of airfield green areas in Abidjan and the sectors, and the unavailability of contractors in the remote parts of the country to provide maintenance services). 21. Savings were due mainly to the lower requirements for diesel fuel oil owing to delayed deployment of contingent-owned vehicles for 1,025 additional military personnel and 375 formed police personnel. In addition, the reduction in travel owing to the consolidation of offices upon completion of the integrated mission headquarters and the closing of several offices within Abidjan resulted in lower requirements for vehicle fuel. 22. Savings also resulted from the actual lower requirements for spare parts owing to the fairly new status of vehicles. 23. Savings were mainly under rental and operation of helicopters and resulted from the lower than projected flying hours owing to the deterioration of the security situation in the north of Côte d'Ivoire, with helicopters grounded in Daloa. In addition, one helicopter was redeployed to the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in October 2005 to support the electoral process and repositioned in January 2007 with all related costs charged to MONUC, which resulted in savings. 24. The unspent balance was attributable mainly to lower actual expenditures on fuel owing to the erroneous charging of fuel for marine boat patrols to the ground transportation budget line. 25. The unspent balance was attributable mainly to lower actual expenditures under commercial communications owing to a decrease in telephone usage, the better implementation of controls on the use of telephone services and prompt recovery of the cost of personal telephone calls. In addition, lower requirements for spare parts and maintenance services owing to the fairly new status of the video/radio transmission, editing and production equipment contributed to savings. 26. Savings were attributable mainly to reduced requirements under information technology services and resulted from the delayed deployment of specialized technical personnel under a global contract.

Savings were attributable mainly to lower actual requirements for medical services, as with the establishment of all medical facilities in the mission area, requirements for external medical services at medical facilities outside the mission area were reduced significantly. In addition, awareness policies adopted by the mission to familiarize staff regarding prevention of common diseases and provision of services, such as malaria testing and other health-related services, contributed to the decrease in requirements for medical services. 28. The unspent balance was attributable mainly to reduced requirements for freight and related costs owing to the proactive monitoring and efficient handling of commercial shipments, resulting in a reduction in demurrage and storage charges from 14 per cent to 6.5 per cent of the total freight charges. In addition, the nonutilization of the provision for freight and inland transportation to cover unexpected movements and troop reconfigurations contributed to the savings. 29.
