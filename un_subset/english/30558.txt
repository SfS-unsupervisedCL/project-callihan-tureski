General Assembly Fifty-ninth session Agenda item 163 The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan Security Council Sixtieth year Letter dated 16 June 2005 from the Permanent Representative of Azerbaijan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to transmit herewith the statement by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan on the so-called "parliamentary elections" of the separatist regime in the occupied Nagorno Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan to be held on 19 June 2005. I should be grateful if the present letter and its annex were urgently distributed as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 163, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Yashar Aliyev Ambassador Permanent Representative [Original: English and Russian] Statement by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan According to the information disseminated by Armenian media, so-called "parliamentary elections" of the separatist regime in the occupied Nagorno Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan are to be held on 19 June 2005. The Azerbaijan side has repeatedly given principal legal assessments of such provocative actions and states again that attempts to impose the fait accompli have no prospects. Holding "elections" in the conditions of territorial seizure and ethnic cleansings contradicts the norms and principles of international law and the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and has no legal effect. Such actions undertaken by the Armenian side do not comply with the spirit of negotiations, in the framework of which positive hopes have been strengthened recently. Sustainable peace cannot be achieved without normalization of life and ensuring peaceful coexistence and cooperation of the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of the Nagorno Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In this regard, the Azerbaijani side supports calls of the international community vis-Ã -vis setting up direct contacts between the communities and carrying out comprehensive confidence-building measures with a view to overcoming hostility and achieving stability and mutual understanding. Such an inter-community dialogue will contribute to establishing relations between Nagorno Karabakh Armenians and to the Azerbaijan population of this region returning to their permanent places of residence, and will create necessary prerequisites for involving all parts of the region's population in a lawful, peaceful and democratic process, including also the formation of legitimate regional authorities at all levels. 14 June 2005
