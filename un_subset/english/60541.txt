Letter dated 19 March 2011 from the Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya addressed to the President of the Security Council In my previous letters to you, I emphasized that an external conspiracy was targeting the Jamahiriya and its unity and territorial integrity. I also pointed out that the Security Council had been drawn into implementing this conspiracy by its adoption of resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011), under which a ban was imposed on all aviation in the airspace of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. By taking this decision, the Security Council has paved the way for military aggression against Libyan territory. France and the United States have bombarded several civilian sites, thereby violating all international norms and instruments, most notably the Charter of the United Nations, which provides for non-intervention in the affairs of Member States. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya calls on the Security Council to hold an emergency meeting in order to halt this aggression, the purpose of which is not to protect civilians, as is purported, but rather to strike civilian sites, economic facilities and sites belonging to the Armed Peoples on Duty. (Signed) Musa M. Abdussalam Kousa Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation
