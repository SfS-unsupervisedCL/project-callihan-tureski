The objective of establishing the Office was to strengthen the United Nations presence in Nairobi and to achieve economies of scale. Under a memorandum of understanding and specific service agreements with UNEP and UN-Habitat, the Office provides them with a full range of administrative and other support services. Under various agreements with offices of other organizations of the United Nations system located in Nairobi, the Office also administers common support services for those offices. The Office also manages the United Nations facilities in Nairobi. The responsibilities of the Office are set out in the Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2009/3 on the organization of the United Nations Office at Nairobi. 29G.2 The substantive programme activities of both UNEP and UN-Habitat are funded predominantly from extrabudgetary resources. On the basis of data on administrative workloads in support of their operations, UNEP and UN-Habitat reimburse the United Nations Office at Nairobi for the services provided for administrative support of their extrabudgetary activities through a system of reimbursement arrangements for the services rendered. A significant component of funding for the Administration, Nairobi, is consequentially of an extrabudgetary origin. This situation was addressed by the General Assembly initially in its resolution 52/220, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to bring the financial arrangements of the Office into line with those of similar United Nations administrative offices. In response to that request and with a view to easing the administrative costs levied on the substantive programmes of UNEP and UN-Habitat, the Secretary-General has made a commitment to gradually increase the regular budget component of the programme budget of the Office. That commitment was reflected in the proposed programme budgets for the bienniums 2000-2001, 2002-2003, 2004-2005, 2006-2007 2008-2009 and 2010-2011 under the section for Administration, Nairobi, and was subsequently endorsed by the Assembly in its resolutions 54/249, 56/253, 57/292, section I, 58/270, 60/247 A, 62/236 and 64/243, whereby the Assembly approved the proposed increases in the level of resources for the administration of the Office. 29G.3 In line with the directives of the General Assembly, the further strengthening of the regular budget component of the Office is reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013, and includes the implementation of the second phase of the review of the post and grade structure of the United Nations Office at Nairobi Administration, namely the upgrade of a number of senior management posts. The remaining recommendations of this review will be considered in future bienniums, as appropriate. 29G.4 In the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 the Secretary-General informed the General Assembly of the review of the internal organization and post and grade structure of the United Nations Office at Nairobi undertaken by the Office of Human Resources Management in 2008. The review concluded that the post and grade structure of the United Nations Office at Nairobi had been classified lower in comparison to that of the United Nations Office at Geneva and the United Nations Office at Vienna. In the context of implementation of the earlier request of the Assembly, the Secretary-General, proposed to restructure, in a gradual manner, the post and grade structure of the United Nations Office at Nairobi and to bring it up to the level of the United Nations Offices at Geneva and Vienna. Accordingly, in the context of the programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011, the Secretary-General proposed and the General Assembly approved the first phase of recommended reclassifications. In the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013, the Secretary-General proposes to reclassify two P-5 posts to the D-1 level, namely the Chiefs of the Human Resources Management Service and the Support Services Service, and two P4 posts to the P-5 level, namely, the Chiefs of the Staff Administration Section and the Procurement Section. 29G.5 With the implementation of the aforementioned proposals, the total regular budget component of resources under section 29G for the biennium 2012-2013 would amount to nearly 52 per cent of the total resources before recosting. 29G.6 In its report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 (A/64/7), the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions pointed out that the organizational structure of the Office was not consistent with the structure indicated in the Secretary-General's bulletin on the organization of the United Nations Office at Nairobi (ST/SGB/2009/3), and expressed an expectation that this anomaly would be rectified and the results would be reflected in the next programme budget. In line with that request, the organigramme and distribution of resources between executive direction and management and the programme of work in the Division of Administrative Services have been adjusted to reflect the actual operational structure of the Office. 29G.7 The overall resources required for the biennium 2012-2013 for the present section amount to $29,196,400 before recosting, reflecting an increase of $60,100. The growth is summarized as follows: (a) The net increase of $31,900 under executive direction and management represents the net effect of the outward redeployment of three posts (1 D-1, 1 P-2 and 1 General Service (Local level)) to the Budget and Financial Management Service to reflect the current operational structure of the Office, partly offset by increases under non-post requirements relating to business continuity; (b) The net increase of $28,200 under the programme of work relates to: (i) A net increase of $710,600 under subprogramme 2, Programme planning, budget and accounts, resulting from the inward redeployment of three posts (1 D-1, 1 P-2 and 1 General Service (Local level)) to the Budget and Financial Management Service to reflect the current operational structure of the Office; (ii) An increase of $96,600 under subprogramme 3, Human resources management, reflecting the reclassification of the P-5 post of the Chief of Service to the D-1 level and one P-4 post of Chief, Staff Administration Section, to the P-5 level; (iii) A net reduction ($546,500) under subprogramme 4, Support services, reflecting the proposed reclassification of the P-5 post of the Chief of Service to the D-1 level and one P-4 post of Chief, Procurement Section, to the P-5 level and decreases under nonpost requirements; (iv) A net reduction ($232,500) under subprogramme 6, Information and communications technology operations. 29G.8 During the biennium 2012-2013, projected extrabudgetary resources amounting to $27,375,300, representing 46.5 per cent of the overall resource requirements, would complement resources from the regular budget to finance various activities of the United Nations Office at Nairobi. The extrabudgetary resource requirements relate to common support services offered by the Office. A major component of funding for the programme of work of the Office is derived from reimbursements from the extrabudgetary resources of UNEP and UN-Habitat for the services provided to their activities based on administrative workloads. Additionally, there have been significant increases in the workload and related income from the common services provided by the United Nations Office at Nairobi to the offices of the United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies located in Nairobi. That trend is likely to continue in the coming bienniums. 29G.9 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269, resources totalling approximately $246,600 (regular budget) and $5,600 (extrabudgetary) were identified within the available capacity of the Division of Administrative Services for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation, comprising 17 work-months at the Professional level under the regular budget and 5.5 work-months at the Local level under the regular budget and extrabudgetary funding. Each organizational unit of the Division establishes targets in specific service areas to gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of its performance. Internal evaluation is based on periodic reviews and analysis of performance data, client surveys conducted by the Client Advisory Committee and real time feedback mechanisms on specific services. The Division also relies on the evaluation capacity of the resident Office of Internal Oversight Services to review the structure and procedures of the Division. 29G.10 The estimated percentage distribution of the resources within the United Nations Office at Nairobi is shown in table 29G.3. The distribution of resources is summarized in tables 29G.4 and 29G.5.
