At its sixty-fourth session in October 2013, the Executive Committee adopted a decision which set out the issues to be examined by the Standing Committee in its programme of work for 2014. This report provides a summary of the implementation of this programme. 2. The Standing Committee held three meetings in 2014: in March, July and September. A planning meeting of Executive Committee members in December 2013 established the calendar of meetings and determined the distribution of the agenda items in 2014. This is provided in annex I. 3. A detailed account of the work undertaken at each of the meetings of the Standing Committee in 2014 is contained in the following documents: the report of the fifty-ninth meeting of the Standing Committee (A/AC.96/1133); the report of the sixtieth meeting of the Standing Committee (A/AC.96/1140); and the report of the sixty-first meeting of the Standing Committee (A/AC.96/1141). A list of documents considered at these meetings is provided in annex II. II. Issues covered by the Standing Committee in 2014 A. Programme budgets and funding 4. At each of its meetings, the Standing Committee considered updates on budgets and funding, through which it was kept informed of programme requirements, budgetary measures and funding levels. The Committee also adopted decisions on budgets and funding, as listed in chapter III below. At its September meeting, the Standing Committee reviewed the biennial programme budget for 2014 and 2015 (revised), as well as an advance version of the Report of Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) on the biennial programme budget. B. International protection 5. In March, the Standing Committee received an oral update on the High Commissioner's 2013 Dialogue on Protection Challenges, which focused on "Protecting the Internally Displaced: Persisting Challenges and Fresh Thinking." An update was also provided on the progress made in identifying a theme for the 2014 conclusion on international protection. In July, the Standing Committee discussed the note on international protection and the progress report on resettlement. The Committee was also briefed on developments concerning the Executive Committee conclusion on international protection. In September, the Committee was informed that the conclusion on international protection did not have the requisite support to be adopted at the sixty-fifth plenary session of the Executive Committee. C. Regional activities and global programmes 6. Reviews of UNHCR's programmes and activities in all five regions (Africa; the Americas; Asia and the Pacific; Europe; and the Middle East and North Africa) were comprehensively considered at the Standing Committee's meeting in March. The Committee also received a report on the Office's global programmes and partnerships, and an oral update on the high-level segment on solidarity and burden-sharing with countries hosting Syrian refugees, which took place during the sixty-fourth plenary session of the Executive Committee in October 2013. In July, the Committee was presented with an update on the Office's work to bring about solutions for displaced persons. It also received a report on refugee health and nutrition, including HIV/AIDS. D. Programme/Protection policy 7. The March and July meetings reviewed reports on: UNHCR's programme in the United Nations' proposed strategic framework for the period 2016-2017; the 2013 global strategic priorities; child protection, including education; and age, gender and diversity. E. Coordination 8. At the July Standing Committee meeting, a summary of elements of UNHCR's oral update to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Coordination and Management Meeting in July was presented to the committee. At the September meeting, an update on coordination and strategic partnerships was considered. F. Management, financial control, administrative oversight and human resources 9. In March, the Standing Committee considered a report on follow-up to the recommendations of the Board of Auditors on the financial statements for previous years and received an oral update on the work of the Inspector General's Office. It was also briefed on the issues of staff safety and security, as well as innovation. 10. In September, the Committee considered the report of the Board of Auditors on UNHCR's financial statements for 2013 and discussed the key issues identified in the report and measures taken by UNHCR in response. The United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services presented its annual report on internal audit activities undertaken at UNHCR for the period 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014, and the Committee received a report from the Independent Audit and Oversight Committee. An update was also provided on human resources, including staff security. Governance 11. In March, the Standing Committee adopted the work programme for 2014, as proposed at its December 2013 planning meeting. At the July meeting, the Standing Committee was invited to make suggestions on issues to be included in the High Commissioner's opening statement at the sixty-fifth plenary session of the Executive Committee. Consultations 12. In accordance with its standard practice, the Standing Committee held a number of informal consultative meetings and briefings during the course of the year on issues requiring in-depth discussion or action. In 2014, the Standing Committee held three informal consultative meetings, two in February and one in August. The February meetings discussed the proposed themes for the ExCom conclusion on international protection as well as the follow-up to the high-level segment on solidarity and burden-sharing with countries hosting Syrian refugees, and the August meeting reviewed the biennial programme budget for 2014-2015 (revised).
