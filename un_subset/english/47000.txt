It also requested the secretariat to inform Parties about the presentations of emerging scientific findings provided by the research programmes and organizations during sessions of the SBSTA. The SBSTA noted that these research programmes and organizations could further facilitate the dialogue through additional informal discussions with Parties and make use of the opportunities afforded by planned meetings outside the UNFCCC process. The SBSTA invited the research programmes and organizations to notify the secretariat of any such additional informal discussions and requested the secretariat to make such notifications available on the UNFCCC website. The SBSTA recognized the substantial challenges in the areas of research and related observations emerging from the IPCC AR4, the UNFCCC workshops and expert meetings on the AR4 and the Nairobi work programme, and the ongoing research dialogue in the context of decision 9/CP.11. The SBSTA encouraged Parties and the research programmes and organizations to further strengthen their efforts to address these challenges. The SBSTA stressed the need to enhance research and related institutional capacity, in particular in developing countries, through individual, bilateral and multilateral actions and/or through the research programmes and organizations. The SBSTA emphasized the need to enhance research activities aimed at supporting adaptation efforts, as identified by the ongoing work under the Nairobi work programme (see paragraphs 10 - 74 above). VII. Methodological issues under the Convention (Agenda item 7) Scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil (Agenda item 7 (a)) The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 4th meetings, on 4 and 13 June, respectively. Statements were made by representatives of four Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. At its 2nd meeting, the SBSTA agreed to consider this item in informal consultations convened by the Chair with the assistance of Mr. Washington Zhakata (Zimbabwe). At the 4th meeting, Mr. Zhakata reported on these consultations. The SBSTA took note of the results of the work on scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil and of the views of Parties on the subject. The SBSTA expressed its appreciation for the work of Parties, research institutions and experts on scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil. It also expressed its appreciation to those governments that provided support for this work. The SBSTA agreed that the work carried out has established robust methodologies to quantify historical contributions to climate change and provided useful information that could help Parties to better understand the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil. The SBSTA noted that there are uncertainties in the underlying historical emissions data, in particular from land-use change and forestry. The SBSTA further noted that the results of the work may be relevant to the work of Parties under other bodies and within other processes under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol. The SBSTA concluded its consideration of this issue. Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport (Agenda item 7 (b)) The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd, 3rd and 4th meetings, on 4, 5 and 13 June, respectively. Statements were made by representatives of 22 Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. Statements were also made by representatives of the secretariats of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). At its 3rd meeting, the SBSTA agreed that the Chair would undertake informal consultations with interested Parties at this session on how this item would be considered. At the 4th meeting, the Chair reported on her consultations. The SBSTA received information from the secretariats of the ICAO and the IMO on ongoing work within these two organizations on emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport. The SBSTA took note of the views expressed by Parties on this information. Recognizing the need to continue the cooperation and the exchange of information between ICAO, IMO and the UNFCCC, the SBSTA agreed to continue to receive information from ICAO and IMO on relevant work on this issue in order to enable Parties to exchange views on this information during its next three sessions. The SBSTA agreed to further consider issues relevant to this agenda item at its thirty-second session. VIII. Methodological issues under the Kyoto Protocol (Agenda item 8) (HCFC-22) facilities seeking to obtain certified emission reductions for the destruction of hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) (Agenda item 8 (a)) At its 2nd meeting, the SBSTA agreed to consider this item in informal consultations convened by the Chair with the assistance of Mr. Jeffrey Spooner (Jamaica). At the 4th meeting, Mr. Spooner reported on these consultations. The SBSTA recalled that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol recognized, in its decision 8/CMP.1, that issuing certified emission reductions for the destruction of hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) at new hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 (HCFC-22) facilities could lead to higher global production of HCFC-22 and/or HFC-23 than would otherwise occur and that the clean development mechanism should not lead to such increases. The SBSTA did not complete its consideration of the issue under this agenda sub-item and agreed to continue its consideration of this issue at its twenty-ninth session. Carbon dioxide capture and storage in geological formations as clean development mechanism project activities (Agenda item 8 (b)) The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 4th meetings, on 4 and 13 June, respectively. Statements were made by representatives of 19 Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the Umbrella Group and one on behalf of the European Community and its member States. At its 2nd meeting, the SBSTA agreed to consider this item in informal consultations convened by the Chair with the assistance of Ms. Gertraud Wollansky (Austria) and Mr. Mohammad Reazuddin (Bangladesh). At the 4th meeting, Mr. Reazuddin reported on these consultations. At its 4th meeting, the SBSTA considered conclusions proposed by the Chair. However, the SBSTA did not agree to adopt these conclusions and so it could not conclude its consideration of the issue. Good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol (Agenda item 8 (c)) The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 4th meetings, on 4 and 13 June, respectively. At its 2nd meeting, the SBSTA agreed to consider this item in informal consultations convened by the Chair with the assistance of Ms. Anke Herold (European Community) and Mr. Nagmeldin Elhassan (Sudan). At the 4th meeting, Ms. Herold reported on these consultations. The SBSTA concluded its consideration of the information included in annex I of its report on its twenty-seventh session. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to integrate the formulae contained in annex IV into the CRF Reporter module being developed in accordance with decision 6/CMP.3, related to the table "Information table on accounting for activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol", in order to facilitate reporting by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol. The SBSTA noted that the secretariat, in implementing the international transaction log (ITL), should ensure that, when carrying out the checks needed for operation of the ITL, full account is taken of decision 16/CMP.1. IX. Scientific, technical and socio-economic aspects of mitigation of climate change (Agenda item 9) The SBSTA considered this item at its 2nd and 4th meetings, on 4 and 13 June, respectively.

The SBSTA agreed that its work under this agenda item to date, including the in-session workshops, has facilitated useful and informative exchanges of information and views among Parties and practitioners. The SBSTA recognized that the work and negotiations on the comprehensive post-2012 climate agreement under the Bali Action Plan address mitigation. The SBSTA agreed, noting the usefulness of working in a manner that is conducive to enhanced interaction among Parties, to consider this issue, taking into account the best available scientific information on mitigation, including in particular information from the IPCC, at its thirty-second session. X. Facilitating the exchange of information and the sharing of experiences on policies and measures of Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Agenda item 10) The SBSTA considered this item at its 2nd and 4th meetings, on 4 and 13 June, respectively. Statements were made by representatives of three Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. At its 2nd meeting, the SBSTA agreed that the Chair would draft conclusions and present them to the SBSTA at its 4th meeting. The SBSTA considered next steps in facilitating the exchange of information and sharing of experiences on policies and measures of Annex I Parties, taking into account the ongoing related work of other subsidiary bodies. The SBSTA noted that Parties have already addressed some aspects of this matter in the context of other agenda items of the SBSTA and the SBI. It also noted that this matter is currently under consideration by the AWG-KP and the AWG-LCA. The SBSTA recognized that duplication of work should be avoided and concluded its consideration of this matter under this agenda item. XI. Matters relating to Article 2, paragraph 3, of the Kyoto Protocol (Agenda item 11) The SBSTA considered this item at its 3rd and 4th meetings, on 5 and 13 June, respectively. Statements were made by representatives of nine Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and one on behalf of the European Community and its member States. At the 3rd meeting, the Chair of the SBSTA informed Parties that the Chair of the SBI had commenced consultations on whether SBI agenda item 10, "Matters relating to Article 3, paragraph 14, of the Kyoto Protocol", could be considered together with this agenda item. The SBSTA agreed that the Chair would remain in contact with SBI Chair and, on the basis of the outcome, meet with interested Parties. At the 4th meeting, the Chair reported that, in the course of informal consultations, agreement had been reached for the SBI and SBSTA to establish a joint contact group to consider this SBSTA agenda item and the SBI agenda item. The joint contact group will commence its work at the twenty-ninth sessions of these subsidiary bodies. The Chair expressed her appreciation to Parties for their support of this proposal. XII. Cooperation with relevant international organizations (Agenda item 12) The SBSTA considered this item at its 2nd and 4th meetings, on 4 and 13 June, respectively. Statements were made by the Executive Secretary, by a representative of the IPCC and by a representative of the secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF). In addition, written statements from the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) were distributed. At its 2nd meeting, the SBSTA agreed that the Chair would draft conclusions and present them to the SBSTA at its 4th meeting. At the 4th meeting, the Chair gave an oral summary report on the in-session workshop on the IPCC AR4, which was organized in response to a mandate from the SBSTA at its twenty-seventh session and took place on 6 June 2008. The SBSTA took note of the statements by representatives of the IPCC and the secretariat of the UNFF. The SBSTA also took note of written statements made available by the secretariat of the CBD and by the IFRC. XIII. Other matters (Agenda item 13) No other matters were raised. XIV. Report on the session (Agenda item 14) At its 4th meeting, on 13 June, the SBSTA considered and adopted the draft report on its twentyeighth session. At the same meeting, the SBSTA authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the session, with the assistance of the secretariat. XV. Closure of the session At the 4th meeting, on 13 June, the secretariat shared with the SBSTA a preliminary evaluation of the financial impact of conclusions adopted by all bodies that had just met in Bonn, in accordance with decision 16/CP.9, paragraph 20. The secretariat indicated that most of the additional activities that it had been asked to undertake could be covered within resources foreseen in the core budget or had already been envisaged in the initial budget estimates under the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities. Approximately USD 2 million is needed to cover a wide range of activities that the secretariat has been asked to undertake to support the Nairobi work programme. Activities to be undertaken in 2008 and to some extent in 2009 should be covered through existing resources, but further contributions were requested in order to ensure sufficient resources to cover all mandated work. The secretariat will continue to analyse the conclusions to determine the exact amount of additional resources required. At the same meeting, the Chair thanked delegates, the chairs of the contact groups and facilitators of informal consultations for their contributions.
