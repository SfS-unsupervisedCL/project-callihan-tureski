Item 5 of the provisional agenda* * A/CONF.213/1. Making the United Nations guidelines on crime prevention work Outcome of the meeting of the expert group to develop supplementary rules specific to the treatment of women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings Report submitted by the Chair of the expert group I. Introduction The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, in its resolution 18/1, entitled "Supplementary rules specific to the treatment of women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings", noted with appreciation the work of the expert round-table meeting on the development of rules for the treatment of women prisoners and non-custodial measures for women offenders organized by the Government of Thailand and held in Bangkok from 2 to 6 February 2009; and requested the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to convene in 2009 an open-ended intergovernmental expert group meeting to develop, consistent with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules) (General Assembly resolution 45/110, annex), supplementary rules specific to the treatment of women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings. Pursuant to Commission resolution 18/1, the expert group to develop supplementary rules specific to the treatment of women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings held a meeting in Bangkok from 23 to 26 November 2009. Experts from 25 Member States attended the meeting. II. Outcome The expert group reviewed the draft rules developed by the expert round-table meeting. Amendments to the draft rules were proposed by representatives and additions were made to the accompanying commentary drafted to elaborate on the draft rules. A second review of the amended draft rules was then carried out. The most recent version of the draft rules is contained in the draft resolution annexed to the present document. The expert group considered a proposal to include in the draft rules a rule to the effect that prisoners who identified themselves as bisexual, lesbian, transgender or transsexual should be entitled to be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. While recognizing that the proposal responded to a real problem, that of the discrimination of such individuals in prisons, many representatives indicated that discussing the proposal was beyond the mandate of the expert group. Noting that, pursuant to Commission resolution 18/1, the expert group was to develop "supplementary rules specific to the treatment of women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings", the expert group felt that the title of the draft rules emerging from the expert round-table meeting (i.e. "rules for the treatment of women prisoners and non-custodial measures for women offenders") better reflected -- from a terminological viewpoint -- the substance of the draft rules, which were supplementary to both the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Tokyo Rules. Pursuant to a recommendation by one representative, the expert group agreed that a call to States not to resort to long incarceration regimes should be included in the text of the final declaration to be adopted by the Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. The expert group reviewed and commented on the text of a draft resolution submitted by the Government of Thailand. The text of the draft resolution as reviewed by the expert group is contained in the annex to the present document. The Twelfth Congress may wish to consider recommending to the Commission at its nineteenth session the approval of the draft resolution for adoption by the General Assembly.

Annex Preliminary observations The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners apply to all prisoners without discrimination; therefore, the specific needs and realities of all prisoners, including of women prisoners, should be taken into account in their application. The Rules, adopted more than 50 years ago, did not, however, draw sufficient attention to women's particular needs. With the increase in the number of women prisoners worldwide, the need to bring more clarity to considerations that should apply to the treatment of women prisoners has acquired importance and urgency. Recognizing the need to provide global standards with regard to the distinct considerations that should apply to women prisoners and offenders and taking into account a number of relevant resolutions adopted by different United Nations bodies, in which Member States were called on to respond appropriately to the needs of women offenders and prisoners, the present rules have been developed to complement and supplement, as appropriate, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules) in connection with the treatment of women prisoners and alternatives to imprisonment for women offenders. The present rules do not in any way replace the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners or the Tokyo Rules and, therefore, all relevant provisions contained in those two sets of rules continue to apply to all prisoners and offenders without discrimination. While some of the present rules bring further clarity to existing provisions in the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and in the Tokyo Rules in their application to women prisoners and offenders, others cover new areas. These rules are inspired by principles contained in various United Nations conventions and declarations and are therefore consistent with the provisions of existing international law. They are addressed to prison authorities and criminal justice agencies (including policymakers, legislators, the prosecution service, the judiciary and the probation service) involved in the administration of non-custodial sanctions and community-based measures. The specific requirements for addressing the situation of women offenders have been emphasized at the United Nations in various contexts. For example, in 1980, the Sixth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders adopted a resolution on the specific needs of women prisoners, in which it recommended that, in the implementation of the resolutions adopted by the Sixth Congress directly or indirectly relevant to the treatment of offenders, recognition should be given to the specific problems of women prisoners and the need to provide the means for their solution; that, in countries where it was not yet done, programmes and services used as alternatives to imprisonment should be made available to women offenders on an equal basis with male offenders; and that the United Nations, the governmental and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with it, and all other international organizations, should make continuing efforts to ensure that the woman offender was treated fairly and equally during arrest, trial, sentence and imprisonment, particular attention being paid to the special problems which women offenders encounter, such as pregnancy and child care. The Seventh Congress, the Eighth Congress and the Ninth Congress also made specific recommendations concerning women prisoners. In the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century, adopted also by the Tenth Congress, Member States committed themselves to taking into account and addressing, within the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme, as well as within national crime prevention and criminal justice strategies, any disparate impact of programmes and policies on women and men (para. 11); and to the development of action-oriented policy recommendations based on the special needs of women as prisoners and offenders (para. 12). The plans of action for the implementation of the Vienna Declaration contain a separate section (sect. XIII) devoted to specific recommended measures to follow up on the commitments undertaken in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Declaration, including that of States reviewing, evaluating and, if necessary, modifying their legislation, policies, procedures and practices relating to criminal matters, in a manner consistent with their legal systems, in order to ensure that women are treated fairly by the criminal justice system. The General Assembly, in its resolution 58/183 of 22 December 2003, entitled "Human rights in the administration of justice" called for increased attention to be devoted to the issue of women in prison, including the children of women in prison, with a view to identifying the key problems and ways in which they could be addressed. In its resolution 61/143 of 19 December 2006, entitled "Intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women", the General Assembly stressed that "violence against women" meant any act of gender-based violence resulting in, or likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life, and urged States to review and, where appropriate, revise, amend or abolish all laws, regulations, policies, practices and customs discriminating against women or having a discriminatory impact on women, and ensure that provisions of multiple legal systems, where they existed, complied with international human rights obligations, commitments and principles, including the principle of non-discrimination; to take positive measures to address structural causes of violence against women and to strengthen prevention efforts addressing discriminatory practices and social norms, including with regard to women in need of special attention, such as women in institutions or in detention; and to provide training and capacity-building on gender equality and women's rights for law enforcement personnel and the judiciary. The resolution is an acknowledgement of the fact that violence against women has specific implications for women's contact with the criminal justice system, as well as their right to be free of victimization while imprisoned. Physical and psychological safety is critical to ensuring human rights and improving outcomes for women offenders, of which the present rules take account. Finally, in the Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses: Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, adopted by the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 25 April 2005, Member States declared that they were committed to the development and maintenance of fair and efficient criminal justice institutions, including the humane treatment of all those in pretrial and correctional facilities, in accordance with applicable international standards (para. 8); and they recommend that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice should give consideration to reviewing the adequacy of standards and norms in relation to prison management and prisoners (para. 30). As with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, in view of the great variety of legal, social, economic and geographical conditions worldwide, it is evident that not all of the following rules can be equally applied in all places and at all times. They should, however, serve to stimulate a constant endeavour to overcome practical difficulties in how they are applied, in the knowledge that they represent, as a whole, the global aspirations considered by the United Nations as leading to the common goal of improving outcomes for women prisoners, their children and their communities. Some of these rules address issues applicable to both men and women prisoners, including those relating to parental responsibilities, some medical services, searching procedures and the like, although the rules are mainly concerned with the needs of women and their children. However, as the focus includes the children of imprisoned mothers, there is a need to recognize the central role of both parents in the lives of children. Accordingly, some of these rules would apply equally to male prisoners and offenders who are fathers. Introduction The following rules do not in any way replace the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Tokyo Rules. Therefore, all provisions contained in those two sets of rules continue to apply to all prisoners and offenders without discrimination. Section I of the rules, covering the general management of institutions, is applicable to all categories of women deprived of their liberty, including criminal or civil, untried or convicted women prisoners, as well as women subject to "security measures" or corrective measures ordered by a judge. Section II contains rules applicable only to the special categories dealt with in each section. Nevertheless, the rules under subsection A, applicable to prisoners under sentence, shall be equally applicable to the category of prisoners dealt with in subsection B, provided they do not conflict with the rules governing that category of women and are for their benefit. Subsections A and B both provide additional rules for the treatment of juvenile female prisoners. It is important to note, however, that separate strategies and policies in accordance with international standards, in particular the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty and the Guidelines for Action on Children in the Criminal Justice System, need to be designed for the treatment and rehabilitation of this category of prisoners, while institutionalization shall be avoided to the maximum possible extent. Section III contains rules covering the application of non-custodial sanctions and measures for women and juvenile female offenders, including on arrest and at the pretrial, sentencing and post-sentencing stages of the criminal justice process. Section IV contains rules on research, planning, evaluation, public awareness-raising and sharing of information, and is applicable to all categories of female offenders covered in these rules. I. Rules of general application 1. Basic principle [Supplements rule 6 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners] Rule 1 In order for the principle of non-discrimination, embodied in rule 6 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners to be put into practice, account shall be taken of the distinctive needs of women prisoners in the application of the Rules.

Adequate attention shall be paid to the admission procedures for women and children, due to their particular vulnerability at this time. Newly arrived women prisoners shall be provided with facilities to contact their relatives; access to legal advice; information about prison rules and regulations, the prison regime and where to seek help when in need in a language that they understand; and, in the case of foreign nationals, access to consular representatives as well. 2. Prior to or on admission, women with caretaking responsibilities for children shall be permitted to make arrangements for those children, including the possibility of a reasonable suspension of detention, taking into account the best interests of the children. 3.

If the woman prisoner agrees to take legal action, appropriate staff shall be informed and immediately refer the case to the competent authority for investigation. Prison authorities shall help such women access legal assistance. 2. Whether or not the woman chooses to take legal action, prison authorities shall endeavour to ensure that she has immediate access to specialized psychological support or counselling. 3. Specific measures shall be developed to avoid any form of retaliation against those making such reports or taking legal action. Rule 8 The right of women prisoners to medical confidentiality, including specifically the right not to share information and not to undergo screening in relation to their reproductive health history, shall be respected at all times. Rule 9 If the woman prisoner is accompanied by a child, that child shall also undergo health screening, preferably by a child health specialist, to determine any treatment and medical needs. Suitable health care, at least equivalent to that in the community, shall be provided. (b) Gender-specific health care Rule 10 1. Gender-specific health-care services at least equivalent to those available in the community shall be provided to women prisoners. 2. If a woman prisoner requests that she be examined or treated by a woman physician or nurse, a woman physician or nurse shall be made available, to the extent possible, except for situations requiring urgent medical intervention. If a male medical practitioner undertakes the examination contrary to the wishes of the woman prisoner, a woman staff member shall be present during the examination. Rule 11 1. Only medical staff shall be present during medical examinations unless the doctor is of the view that exceptional circumstances exist or the doctor requests a member of the prison staff to be present for security reasons or the woman prisoner specifically requests the presence of a member of staff as indicated in rule 10, paragraph 2 above. 2. If it is necessary for non-medical prison staff to be present during medical examinations, such staff should be women and examinations shall be carried out in a manner that safeguards privacy, dignity and confidentiality.

Prison regime [Supplements rules 65, 66 and 70-81 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners] Rule 42 1. Women prisoners shall have access to a balanced and comprehensive programme of activities, which take account of gender-appropriate needs. 2.

Particular efforts shall be made to provide appropriate services for women prisoners who have psychosocial support needs, especially those who have been subjected to physical, mental or sexual abuse. Social relations and aftercare [Supplements rules 79-81 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners] Rule 43 Prison authorities shall encourage and, where possible, also facilitate visits to women prisoners as an important prerequisite to ensuring their mental well-being and social reintegration. Rule 44 In view of women prisoners' disproportionate experience of domestic violence, they shall be properly consulted as to who, including which family members, is allowed to visit them. Rule 45 Prison authorities shall utilize options such as home leave, open prisons, halfway houses and community-based programmes and services to the maximum possible extent for women prisoners, to ease their transition from prison to liberty, to reduce stigma and to re-establish their contact with their families at the earliest possible stage. Rule 46 Prison authorities, in cooperation with probation and/or social welfare services, local community groups and non-governmental organizations, shall design and implement comprehensive pre- and post-release reintegration programmes which take into account the gender-specific needs of women. Rule 47 Additional support following release shall be provided to released women prisoners who need psychological, medical, legal and practical help to ensure their successful social reintegration, in cooperation with services in the community. 3. Pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and mothers with children in prison [Supplements rule 23 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners] Rule 48 1. Pregnant or breastfeeding women prisoners shall receive advice on their health and diet under a programme to be drawn up and monitored by a qualified health practitioner. Adequate and timely food, a healthy environment and regular exercise opportunities shall be provided free of charge for pregnant women, babies, children and breastfeeding mothers. 2. Women prisoners shall not be discouraged from breastfeeding their children, unless there are specific health reasons to do so. 3. The medical and nutritional needs of women prisoners who have recently given birth, but whose babies are not with them in prison, shall be included in treatment programmes. Rule 49 Decisions to allow children to stay with their mothers in prison shall be based on the best interests of the children. Children in prison with their mothers shall never be treated as prisoners. Rule 50 Women prisoners whose children are in prison with them shall be provided with the maximum possible opportunities to spend time with their children. Rule 51 1. Children living with their mothers in prison shall be provided with ongoing health-care services and their development shall be monitored by specialists, in collaboration with community health services. 2. The environment provided for such children's upbringing shall be as close as possible to that of a child outside prison. Rule 52 1. Decisions as to when a child is to be separated from its mother shall be based on individual assessments and the best interests of the child within the scope of relevant national laws. 2. The removal of the child from prison shall be undertaken with sensitivity, only when alternative care arrangements for the child have been identified and, in the case of foreign national prisoners, in consultation with consular officials. 3. After children are separated from their mothers and placed with family or relatives or in other alternative care, women prisoners shall be given the maximum possible opportunity and facilities to meet with their children, when it is in the best interests of the children and when public safety is not compromised. 4. Foreign nationals [Supplements rule 38 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners] Rule 53 1. Where relevant bilateral or multilateral agreements are in place, the transfer of non-resident foreign national women prisoners to their home country, especially if they have children in their home country, shall be considered as early as possible during their imprisonment, following the application or informed consent of the woman concerned. 2. Where a child living with a non-resident foreign national woman prisoner is to be removed from prison, consideration should be given to relocation of the child to its home country, taking into account the best interests of the child and in consultation with the mother. 5. Minorities and indigenous peoples Rule 54 Prison authorities shall recognize that women prisoners from different religious and cultural backgrounds have distinctive needs and may face multiple forms of discrimination in their access to gender- and culture-relevant programmes and services. Accordingly, prison authorities shall provide comprehensive programmes and services that address these needs, in consultation with women prisoners themselves and the relevant groups. Rule 55 Pre- and post-release services shall be reviewed to ensure that they are appropriate and accessible to indigenous women prisoners and to women prisoners from ethnic and racial groups, in consultation with the relevant groups. B. Prisoners under arrest or awaiting trial [Supplements rules 84-93 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners] Rule 56 The particular risk of abuse that women face in pretrial detention shall be recognized by relevant authorities, which shall adopt appropriate measures in policies and practice to guarantee such women's safety at this time. (See also rule 58 below, with regard to alternatives to pretrial detention.) III. Non-custodial measures Rule 57 The provisions of the Tokyo Rules shall guide the development and implementation of appropriate responses to women offenders. Gender-specific options for diversionary measures and pretrial and sentencing alternatives shall be developed within Member States' legal systems, taking account of the history of victimization of many women offenders and their caretaking responsibilities. Rule 58 Taking into account the provisions of rule 2.3 of the Tokyo Rules, women offenders shall not be separated from their families and communities without due consideration being given to their backgrounds and family ties. Alternative ways of managing women who commit offences, such as diversionary measures and pretrial and sentencing alternatives, shall be implemented wherever appropriate and possible. Rule 59 Generally, non-custodial means of protection, for example in shelters managed by independent bodies, non-governmental organizations or other community services, shall be used to protect women who need such protection. Temporary measures involving custody to protect a woman shall only be applied when necessary and expressly requested by the woman concerned and shall in all cases be supervised by judicial or other competent authorities. Such protective measures shall not be continued against the will of the woman concerned. Rule 60 Appropriate resources shall be made available to devise suitable alternatives for women offenders in order to combine non-custodial measures with interventions to address the most common problems leading to women's contact with the criminal justice system. These may include therapeutic courses and counselling for victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse; suitable treatment for those with mental disability; and educational and training programmes to improve employment prospects. Such programmes shall take account of the need to provide care for children and women-only services. Rule 61 When sentencing women offenders, courts shall have the power to consider mitigating factors such as lack of criminal history and relative non-severity and nature of the criminal conduct, in the light of women's caretaking responsibilities and typical backgrounds. Rule 62 The provision of gender-sensitive, trauma-informed, women-only substance abuse treatment programmes in the community and women's access to such treatment shall be improved, for crime prevention as well as for diversion and alternative sentencing purposes. 1. Post-sentencing dispositions Rule 63 Decisions regarding early conditional release (parole) shall favourably take into account women prisoners' caretaking responsibilities, as well as their specific social reintegration needs. 2. Pregnant women and women with dependent children Rule 64 Non-custodial sentences for pregnant women and women with dependent children shall be preferred where possible and appropriate, with custodial sentences being considered when the offence is serious or violent or the woman represents a continuing danger, and after taking into account the best interests of the child or children, while ensuring that appropriate provision has been made for the care of such children. 3. Juvenile female offenders Rule 65 Institutionalization of children in conflict with the law shall be avoided to the maximum extent possible. The gender-based vulnerability of juvenile female offenders shall be taken into account in decision-making. Rule 66 Maximum effort shall be made to ratify the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing that Convention to fully implement their provisions so as to provide maximum protection to victims of trafficking in order to avoid secondary victimization of many foreign national women. IV. Research, planning, evaluation and public awareness-raising 1. Research, planning and evaluation Rule 67 Efforts shall be made to organize and promote comprehensive, result-oriented research on the offences committed by women, the reasons that trigger women's confrontation with the criminal justice system, the impact of secondary criminalization and imprisonment on women, the characteristics of women offenders, as well as programmes designed to reduce reoffending by women, as a basis for effective planning, programme development and policy formulation to respond to the social reintegration needs of women offenders. Rule 68 Efforts shall be made to organize and promote research on the number of children affected by their mothers' confrontation with the criminal justice system, and imprisonment in particular, and the impact of this on the children, in order to contribute to policy formulation and programme development, taking into account the best interests of the children. Rule 69 Efforts shall be made to review, evaluate and make public periodically the trends, problems and factors associated with offending behaviour in women and the effectiveness in responding to the social reintegration needs of women offenders, as well as their children, in order to reduce the stigmatization and negative impact of those women's confrontation with the criminal justice system on them. 2. Raising public awareness, sharing information and training Rule 70 1. The media and the public shall be informed about the reasons that lead to women's entrapment in the criminal justice system and the most effective ways to respond to it, in order to enable women's social reintegration, taking into account the best interests of their children. 2. Publication and dissemination of research and good practice examples shall form comprehensive elements of policies that aim to improve the outcomes and the fairness to women and their children of criminal justice responses to women offenders. 3. The media, the public and those with professional responsibility in matters concerning women prisoners and offenders shall be provided regularly with factual information about the matters covered in these rules and about their implementation. 4. Training programmes on the present rules and the results of research shall be developed and implemented for relevant criminal justice officials to raise their awareness and sensitize them to their provisions contained therein.
