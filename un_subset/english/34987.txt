National level The Constitution places great importance on human rights and civil liberties, and its guarantees conform to the standards under relevant international instruments. Title II of the Constitution and articles 10 to 20 uphold the question of human rights and human dignity. Furthermore, the country has taken progressive steps to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and in particular those of women on the basis of equality of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. :: Djibouti adopted the family code on 31 January 2002, making gender equality a fundamental principle of Djiboutian society and a basis for the strengthening of the family unit. :: The ratio of women's representation in Parliament has passed from none to 11 per cent by enactment from the Government, which counts two women in its cabinet. :: The role of the Ministry of Justice has been enlarged to deal with the question of human rights. :: The Government of Djibouti has created the post of MÃ©diateur (ombudsman). The role of this institution is to mediate between citizens and public authorities in order to respect the rules of equality, equity and the primacy of law. It contributes to conciliation between citizens and administrations as well as settlements of administrative disputes while examining complaints of those who consider themselves victims of illegal or inequitable administrative decisions. Djibouti has shouldered important human responsibilities by protecting and sheltering an enormous number of refugees since its independence in 1977 and in this regard reiterates its commitment to fulfilling its obligations in accordance with the principles of international refugee law and international human rights law. Committed to continuing its active contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights at all levels, the Republic of Djibouti would highly appreciate the valuable support of the States Members of the United Nations to its candidature.
