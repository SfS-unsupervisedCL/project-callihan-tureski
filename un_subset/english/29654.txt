Letter dated 8 November 2004 from the Permanent Representative of Australia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council In advance of the Security Council's landmark meeting in Nairobi on 18 and 19 November on the situation in the Sudan, I am writing at the formal request of my Government to convey Australia's grave concern -- shared I know by many -- at the deteriorating situation in Darfur, particularly the worsening security, human rights and humanitarian situation and the increasing numbers of internally displaced persons (including recent reports of forced relocations). You will recall that I wrote, jointly with my Canadian and New Zealand colleagues, to the Security Council President on 10 September (S/2004/739) expressing deep concern at the ongoing suffering of Darfur's population and urging the Council not to foreclose any avenue in its efforts to ensure the protection of civilians. I also urged the Council to put its full support behind the efforts of the African Union (AU), including the deployment of a significantly expanded AU mission, and Australia welcomes the efforts of the Council to this end. You will be aware that Australia has also been working closely with the AU to implement our offer of airlift support for the deployment of AU troops to Darfur, in addition to our commitment during 2004 of $20 million in humanitarian assistance and we stand ready to consider further requests for assistance. In light of the dire warnings conveyed in the presentation to the Security Council by the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Jan Pronk, on 4 November, I wish to register Australia's strong wish that the Security Council, on the international community's behalf, continue to take an active role in resolving the serious conflicts facing the Sudan. Australia also supports Mr. Pronk's suggestion that the Security Council use the Nairobi meeting to maintain strong pressure on all parties in the Sudan to meet their obligations to protect civilians and work constructively to reach a peaceful settlement of the conflicts facing their country. I should be grateful if you would circulate the present letter as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) John Dauth
