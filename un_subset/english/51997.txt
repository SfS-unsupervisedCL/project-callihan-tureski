Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) concerning Somalia Note verbale dated 3 November 2009 from the Permanent Mission of Spain to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Committee The Permanent Mission of Spain to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) concerning Somalia and has the honour to refer to the Chairman's note verbale SCA/1/09 (16) of 24 September 2009, in which he drew the attention of the Permanent Mission to various paragraphs of Security Council resolution 1844 (2008) and recalled certain exemptions to the general and complete arms embargo imposed by virtue of Security Council resolution 733 (1992). With reference to resolution 1844 (2008), paragraph 7, we wish to report that the Subsidiary Office for Foreign Trade in Defence-Related and Dual-Use Material in the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade has, through the Special Duty and Tax Department, assigned all merchandise covered by paragraph 7 to the "red screen" category in the Spanish customs regime, which allows a systematic inspection not only of documents but also of the physical merchandise in the customs offices, with a view to ensuring the fullest compliance with the expanded scope of the embargo established by resolution 1844 (2008). Furthermore, we would like to inform you that the Inter-Ministerial Regulatory Board for External Trade in Defence-Related and Dual-Use Material will deny any request for a transfer permit for defence-related material and dual-use products and technologies being shipped to Somalia, in application of Security Council resolutions 733 (1992) and 1844 (2008). The Board will, on a case-by-case basis, review any requests for permits that might be exempt from the embargo under resolutions 1772 (2007) and 1851 (2008). It should be noted that, to date, no transfer permits have been issued for defence-related material, dual-use products and technologies or any other material intended for Somalia. The Permanent Mission takes this opportunity to convey to the Chairman of the Committee the renewed assurances of its highest consideration.
