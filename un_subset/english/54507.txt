Expresses serious concern at the violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as of refugee and international humanitarian law, in the context of countering terrorism; 3.

Reaffirms its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods, practices and financing of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renews its commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism and, in that regard, calls upon States and other relevant actors, as appropriate, to continue to implement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which reaffirms, inter alia, respect for human rights for all and the rule of law to be the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism; 5.
