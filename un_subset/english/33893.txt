Letter dated 26 July 2005 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council I would like to request a meeting of the Security Council to discuss the report of 25 July 2005 on the fact-finding mission of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on human settlements. It is important that the meeting take place before the planned departure of the Special Envoy from New York on the evening of 28 July. (Signed) Emyr Jones Parry
