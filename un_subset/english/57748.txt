The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in section V of the present report. 1. The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 1 February 2010 (A/64/641 and Corr.1) and amounted to $564,536,900 gross ($552,557,100 net). It provided for 15,000 military contingent personnel, 404 international staff (including 3 temporary positions) and 741 national staff. 2. In paragraph 57 of its related report of 30 April 2010 (A/64/660/Add.14), the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions recommended that the General Assembly appropriate $534,489,200 gross for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. 3. The General Assembly, by its resolution 64/282, appropriated an amount of $518,710,200 gross ($507,713,700 net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance A. Overall 4. The mandate of the Force was established by the Security Council in its resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978), expanded in resolution 1701 (2006) and extended in subsequent resolutions of the Council. The mandate for the performance period was provided by the Council in its resolutions 1884 (2009) and 1937 (2010). 5. The Force is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to restore international peace and security in southern Lebanon. 6. Within this overall objective, the Force has, during the performance report period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below, which are grouped under the operations and support components. 7. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based-budgeting frameworks set out in the 2010/11 budget. In particular, the performance report compares the actual indicators of achievement, that is, the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement, and the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs. B. Budget implementation 8. During the reporting period, UNIFIL, in close coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces, continued its regular operational activities of monitoring the cessation of hostilities and assisting the Lebanese Armed Forces in maintaining its area of operations free of unauthorized armed personnel, assets and weapons other than its own and those of UNIFIL through regular patrolling activities and efforts to prevent violations of the Blue Line. At the same time, the Maritime Task Force continued to conduct maritime interdiction operations in the area of maritime operations and exercises with the Lebanese Armed Forces Navy. In undertaking its mandated operational activities, the Force continued to intensify its cooperation and coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces, including through joint operational activities and regular exercises and training activities. UNIFIL also maintained a high level of liaison and coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defense Forces with a view to maintaining the cessation of hostilities and preventing violations of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). In this connection, UNIFIL continued to facilitate and lead a tripartite mechanism with representatives from the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, which continued to serve as a mechanism for the parties to discuss operational and security matters on a regular basis. It also served as the key mechanism for measures to build confidence and trust between the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, and to prevent any outbreak of hostilities. 9. By carrying out its mandate as stipulated in Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), UNIFIL, in cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces, continued to build on prior achievements in stabilizing the area of operations. UNIFIL continued regular operational activities to prevent violations of the Blue Line by visibly marking the Blue Line and providing support to the Lebanese authorities for the construction of a Blue Line road, and continued to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces in taking steps towards establishing an area south of the Litani River free of any unauthorized armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces. UNIFIL continued its efforts to facilitate the withdrawal of Israel Defense Forces from northern Ghajar and an adjacent area north of the Blue Line as an important provision of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). In this regard, UNIFIL finalized proposed security arrangements which would be put in place following the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces. However, Israel has not responded positively to the proposal. No progress was made in the establishment of a UNIFIL Office in Tel Aviv, as had been agreed by the Government of Israel in 2007. 10. UNIFIL civilian personnel continued to provide political advice and guidance to the military component and to conduct an increased number of public information and civil affairs activities. In particular, UNIFIL carried out activities that assisted the Government of Lebanon in extending its authority in southern Lebanon and in increasing the capacity of the Lebanese Armed Forces to provide security within the area of operations of the Force, including by enhancing the civilian-military coordination capacity of the Lebanese Armed Forces, carrying out special initiatives focusing on youth and women as well as on environmental and other cross-cutting issues, and the continued application of an externally funded survey to assess the perception of local communities of UNIFIL and their understanding of the Force's mandate under Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), and assisted local municipalities in the preparation of feasibility studies for donor-funded projects, which resulted in greater external funding to municipalities and increased capacity of municipal staff in key aspects of project management. 11. The relations between the local population in southern Lebanon and UNIFIL troops remained of critical importance in the implementation of the mandate. In this regard, UNIFIL continued to build confidence with the local population through the provision of humanitarian and development-related assistance, as well as support to contingents in reaching the local population through the use of a variety of media tools with a view to ensuring a better understanding of the mandate and activities of the Force. 12. The parties continued to be fully committed to the mandated tasks of UNIFIL in the implementation of resolution 1701 (2006). An exchange of fire took place between the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defence Forces, and tension remained high for some time in its aftermath. There were also other periods of increased tension owing to developments in the wider region, which often required the UNIFIL military component to operate at the limit of its capacity. C. Mission support initiatives 13. UNIFIL continued to apply restrictions and economy measures with respect to diesel fuel consumption, resulting in a total reduction of 3.6 million litres for both generators and vehicles from the planned consumption of 28.6 million litres (equivalent to a 12.6 per cent reduction) without affecting the operational effectiveness of the Force. The economy measures that were implemented included the rational utilization of air conditioning units, generator load management (load-shedding), wider utilization of electric cars within the Force headquarters, strict compliance with the carpool policy, and limitations imposed on non-essential and short distance trips. The discontinuation of the use of United Nations-owned vehicles for recreation/welfare and other off-duty travel from May 2011, owing to security reasons, also resulted in lower fuel consumption. In addition, the composite ration packs/meals ready to eat continued to be fully consumed prior to the expiration of their shelf life and were not written-off. 14. UNIFIL continued to implement environmental initiatives, including the transportation of recyclable material from UNIFIL positions to a sorting facility in the area of operations, in cooperation with international and local governmental and non-governmental organizations, as a means of assistance to local municipalities. The environmental strategy, which was cost neutral since existing human and material capacity were utilized, resulted in the reduction of the Force's environmental footprint in the mission area, in particular the reduction of the amount of solid waste destined for landfills. 15. In addition, the Force introduced the assignment of medical specialists to Level I+ medical facilities to provide medical care for UNIFIL personnel, which resulted in a decrease in the number of patients referred to higher level facilities and contributed to an unutilized balance of $286,300 under the medical class of expenditure. 16. Furthermore, the Force utilized its own trucks, to the extent feasible, for the movement of cargo from Beirut (seaport and airport) to different destinations in the area of operations, thereby reducing the planned reliance on commercial freight forwarding services. This initiative resulted in an unutilized balance of $142,700 under the other supplies, services and equipment class of expenditure. 17. UNIFIL continued to demonstrate a steady trend of improvement in its vacancy rates with respect to all categories of staff as a result of an effective recruitment policy introduced by the Force. In order to meet its overall target of a 10 per cent vacancy rate in its human resources action plan for the 2010/11 period, UNIFIL expedited its recruitment process and filled international vacancies through the selection of candidates from the available rosters approved by the field central review bodies. The Force also adopted the roster approach for the selection of national staff to expedite the filling of vacancies. 18. During the reporting period, the lower vacancy rate of 11 per cent, compared with 16 per cent budgeted, and the revision of the national salary scales with effect from 1 September 2010 resulted in additional requirements of $10.2 million. In addition, the higher average fuel cost of $0.74 per litre, compared with the budgeted cost of $0.47 per litre, resulted in total additional requirements of $5.8 million for vehicle and generator fuel. The additional requirements were partly offset by reduced requirements for troop cost reimbursements owing to the higher average vacancy rate of 21 per cent for military personnel, as compared with the budgeted delayed deployment factor of 20 per cent, resulting in an unspent balance of $16.1 million under the military contingents class of expenditure. D. Regional mission cooperation 19. UNIFIL expanded its close cooperation with United Nations peacekeeping operations in the region and maintained its cooperation and coordination with the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon and the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. The Force also collaborated closely with the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) to mitigate tensions in its area of operations, in particular along the Blue Line. 20. UNIFIL served as the regional coordinator hub for communications and information technology services, conduct and discipline, HIV/AIDS and oversight activities for UNIFIL, UNDOF, UNTSO, the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy. The regional coordination plans cover the areas of communications and information technology services, training, HIV/AIDS, conduct and discipline, as well as security, which were further developed and implemented to align with the objectives of the Force, while bearing in mind the specific mandates of other peacekeeping missions. The coordination and collaboration among peacekeeping missions in the region were enhanced with a view to achieving greater synergy in the use of resources. 21. UNIFIL continued to maintain close cooperation with the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia on the sharing of regional information on economic and social development, including cost-of-living surveys, and the use of its training facilities. The Force also maintained close cooperation with the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, which coordinates the work of all United Nations agencies in Lebanon and provides an interface with the Government of Lebanon on political aspects relevant to Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). The Force provided various administrative services and logistical and technical support to the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon when resources were available. 22. The Security Information Operations Centre of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Beirut continued to provide security information for all United Nations staff operating and/or living in Lebanon north of the Litani River and was responsible for the security clearance of UNIFIL staff travelling to Beirut. 23. UNIFIL civilian and military personnel participated in inter-agency coordination meetings for south Lebanon organized under the auspices of the United Nations Resident Coordinator. During the period under review, UNIFIL had a Field Security Adviser in Beirut who was in continuous contact with the North Litani River Chief Security Adviser on security-related matters and who represented the UNIFIL Chief Security Officer at meetings of the Security Management Team and Security Cell. UNIFIL provided security support to and clearance and evacuation arrangements for staff of United Nations agencies based within its area of operations. Staff of United Nations agencies based and operating in the UNIFIL area of operations were fully integrated into the South Litani River Security Plan and had full access to the UNIFIL emergency communications system and security services. A UNIFIL Military Liaison Officer and a UNIFIL Security Officer conducted meetings with United Nations agencies operating in southern Lebanon in order to ensure full coordination and cooperation on security issues. E. Results-based-budgeting frameworks Component 1: operations 24. Under the operations component, UNIFIL continued its regular patrolling and operational activities of monitoring the cessation of hostilities, in close coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces, to prevent violations of the Blue Line with the aim of further stabilizing the area of operations south of the Litani River. UNIFIL also continued to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces in ensuring that the area between the Blue Line and the Litani River was free of unauthorized armed personnel, assets or weapons. The Maritime Task Force continued to patrol and conduct maritime interdiction operations in the area of maritime operations, in cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces Navy, and continued to provide training to the Lebanese naval forces. The Force further intensified and strengthened its cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces, as called for in Security Council resolution 1884 (2009). In addition, UNIFIL maintained a high level of liaison and coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defense Forces with a view to maintaining the cessation of hostilities and preventing violations of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). In this connection, UNIFIL continued to lead and facilitate a tripartite mechanism with representatives of the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israel Defense Forces as the central mechanism for liaison and coordination and as a means of addressing operational and security matters, including violations of resolution 1701 (2006). Expected accomplishment 1.1: Stable and secure environment in southern Lebanon Planned indicators of achievement Actual indicators of achievement Absence of air, sea or ground incursions or firing incidents across the Blue Line 2,747 air violations and 25 ground violations of the Blue Line; 24 instances of stone throwing; and 1 breach of the cessation of hostilities; the Israel Defense Forces continued to maintain a presence in the northern part of Ghajar village and an adjacent area (north of the Blue Line), which is a continuous violation Lebanese Armed Forces deployed throughout the entire area south of the Litani River, including the part of Ghajar village north of the Blue Line 3 Lebanese Armed Forces heavy infantry brigades deployed throughout the area of operations, with the exception of the northern part of Ghajar village and the adjacent area in which the Israel Defense Forces continued to maintain a presence, which is a continuous violation Area between the Blue Line and the Litani River is free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons, except for those of the Lebanese Armed Forces and of UNIFIL Within the UNIFIL area of operations: two explosions occurred, one in a building and another in a field, the causes of which could not be determined;

During the reporting period, the support component provided effective and efficient logistical, administrative and security support in the implementation of the mandate through the delivery of related outputs, the implementation of service improvements and the realization of efficiency gains under medical services and freight forwarding services. Support was provided to an average strength of 11,862 military contingent personnel, 337 international staff (including temporary positions) and 654 national staff. The range of support comprised all support services, including the implementation of conduct and discipline and HIV/AIDS programmes, personnel administration, health care, information technology and communications, ground transport operations, monitoring and control over the supply of rations, fuel and general supply items, as well as security services Force-wide. Expected accomplishment 2.1: Effective and efficient logistical, administrative and security support to the Force Reduction of major operational shortfalls in provision of language support services from 10 cases per year to 2 cases Achieved. No major shortfall was experienced as a result of the pooling of resources and use of temporary assignments to address all operational requirements Reduction in the number of major vehicle accidents (2008/09: 314; 2009/10: 247; 2010/11: 228) The total number of vehicle accidents involving repair work in excess of $500 was 36, which was attributable to the conduct of road safety campaigns, monitoring of the CarLog system and the deployment of Military Police during peak hours Full implementation of the Misconduct Database Tracking System, with accurate and up-to-date information on all cases in peacekeeping missions in the Middle East region All complaints and/or allegations of misconduct were assessed and processed in accordance with policy and procedural requirements, with all relevant documents uploaded in the Misconduct Database Tracking System in a timely manner Enhanced zone warden exercises (minimum of 2 exercises per month in the 2010/11 period) Out of 12 planned exercises, 11 were conducted while 1 was cancelled for security reasons; in addition, separate communications/radio exercises were conducted on a monthly basis for all zone wardens in all zones Increase in the number of zone wardens (2009/10: 35 zone wardens; 2010/11: 60 zone wardens) Achieved. The total number of zone wardens was 74, comprising 30 international and 44 national staff, as the result of additional requirements related to the restructuring to a more appropriate and effective delineation of zones Increase in the number of peer educators and voluntary counselling assistants (2009/10: 200; 2010/11: 250) 54 peer educators were trained as a result of the lower actual number of registered participants in 3 training sessions Increase in the number of multidisciplinary health-care workers (doctors, nurses and laboratory personnel) trained in voluntary counselling and confidential testing protocols and universal safety precautions and guidelines for post-exposure prophylaxis (2009/10: 25; 2010/11: 50) 28 multidisciplinary health-care workers were trained in voluntary counselling and confidential testing protocols and post-exposure prophylaxis; the lower number was attributable to the limited number of health-care workers Service improvements Enhancement of language support services, including the introduction of the Force headquarters standby roster to ensure round-the-clock coverage and the centralization of similar language support services to meet operational requirements The Force headquarters Language Assistant standby duty roster was established and implemented; the pooling of similar language support services was effected in two locations Implementation of maintenance programme at every 5,000 kilometres of service of the UNIFIL vehicle fleet and of road safety campaigns A total of 7,876 work orders were processed, including preventive maintenance Implementation of a conduct and discipline programme for all military and civilian personnel, including training, prevention, monitoring and recommendations on remedial actions where misconduct has occurred Training: 2,039 United Nations personnel received induction training on conduct and discipline (1,366 military and 194 civilian staff), attended the military training-of-trainers programme (202), and received training on the prevention of sexual abuse and exploitation (89 civilian staff) and prevention of harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority (188 civilian staff) Cases: review and evaluation of a total of 757 reports or complaints of misconduct Prevention: implementation measures included the launch of the Regional Conduct and Discipline Team Intranet;

Summary information on redeployments across groups (Thousands of United States dollars) Group Appropriation Original distribution Redeployment Revised distribution I. Military and police personnel II. Civilian personnel III. Operational costs Total Percentage of redeployment to total appropriation 26. The redeployment of funds was attributable primarily to additional requirements under: (a) civilian personnel, owing to lower actual vacancy rates for both categories of civilian personnel than planned and the revision of national salary scales with effect from September 2010; and (b) operational costs, resulting from the deployment of a higher number of naval vessels (8) than planned (7) and from higher costs of diesel fuel, liquid propane gas, kerosene and aviation fuel. The additional requirements were offset in part by reduced requirements for standard reimbursements to troop-contributing governments for contingent-owned equipment under military personnel owing to delays in the planned deployment of some military units, the early repatriation of two units and the deployment of fewer items of equipment compared with the provisions of the memorandums of understanding. 27. Higher expenditures for the months of September and October 2010 and March and May 2011 related to reimbursements to troop-contributing governments for troop costs, contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment. D. Other income and adjustments Interest income Other/miscellaneous income Prior-period adjustments Cancellation of prior-period obligations E.

Value of non-budgeted contributions Actual value Status-of-forces agreementa a Relates to land and premises provided by the host Government, including UNIFIL House in Beirut, a rear headquarters evacuation centre, UNIFIL headquarters in Naqoura and military position as well as services, value added tax refunds and duty waivers. 28. The unspent balance was attributable mainly to reduced requirements for: (a) standard reimbursements to troop-contributing governments for contingent-owned equipment owing to delays in the planned deployment of some units, the early repatriation of two units and the deployment of fewer items of equipment compared with the provisions of the memorandums of understanding; (b) standard reimbursements to contributing governments for troop costs, owing to the higher actual vacancy rate of 21 per cent against 20 per cent planned; and (c) for recreational leave allowances, owing to the rotation of some contingent personnel before the completion of their six-month period of service. The unspent balance was partly offset by additional requirements for mission subsistence allowance resulting from the full deployment of staff officers, compared with the 20 per cent delayed deployment factor applied in the budget, and from overlaps during rotation periods. 29. The additional requirements were attributable to the lower actual vacancy rate of 16.7 per cent as compared with the budgeted vacancy factor of 22 per cent. 30. The additional requirements were attributable mainly to: (a) the lower actual vacancy rate of 11.7 per cent compared with 16 per cent planned; and (b) the revision of the national salary scales with effect from September 2010. 31. The unspent balance resulted primarily from the higher actual vacancy rate of 13.9 per cent compared with the budgetary assumption of full incumbency of three international positions in the Conduct and Discipline Team. 32. The unutilized balance resulted primarily from the non-utilization of police consultants in the absence of a request from the host Government and the cancellation of the planned safety management system training owing to the security situation in the mission area. 33. The additional requirements were attributable primarily to: (a) the higher average actual cost of $0.74 per litre for diesel fuel compared with the budgeted cost of $0.47 per litre; (b) higher consumption of liquid propane gas, owing to the installation of new kitchens and the higher average actual cost of $1.19 per kilogramme of liquid propane gas, compared with the budgeted cost of $0.81 per kilogramme; and (c) the settlement of outstanding invoices for accommodation equipment related to the 2009/10 financial period. The additional requirements were partly offset by reduced requirements for standard reimbursements to troop-contributing governments for self-sustainment owing to the higher actual vacancy rate of 21 per cent, compared with 20 per cent budgeted. 34. The additional requirements were attributable mainly to the higher average actual cost of $0.74 per litre of diesel fuel compared with the budgeted cost of $0.47 per litre. The variance was partly offset by reduced requirements for the acquisition of vehicles, resulting from the cancellation of the planned replacement of one fire truck. 35. The unutilized balance was attributable mainly to reduced requirements for the rental and operation of helicopters resulting from: (a) the lower number of actual hours flown (1,917) than planned (2,580) owing to the use of road transportation, whenever feasible; (b) the reduction in the frequency of shuttle flights to Beirut; and (c) the downsizing of the helicopter fleet from nine aircraft to seven. The variance was partly offset by additional requirements resulting from the higher average actual cost of $0.78 per litre of aviation fuel compared with the budgeted cost of $0.50 per litre. 36. The additional requirements were attributable to the higher average deployment of eight naval vessels, compared with seven vessels planned, and the variation in the actual configuration of the fleet than originally planned, i.e. actual deployment of two frigates, three patrol boats, one support ship, two corvettes and one helicopter, compared with the planned deployment of three frigates, one combat support ship, three patrol boats and two helicopters. The variance was partly offset by lower actual costs for liability insurance. 37. The unspent balance was attributable mainly to the cancellation of obligations pertaining to the rental of three Cobra radar systems and two NCI radar systems owing to the non-receipt of related invoices, and reduced requirements for standard reimbursements to troop-contributing governments for self-sustainment owing to the lower actual deployment of military personnel than planned. The unspent balance was partly offset by increased requirements for the replacement of telephone equipment. 38. The unspent balance was attributable primarily to reduced requirements for medical services, resulting from the assignment of medical specialists from troop-contributing countries to the level I+ medical facilities, resulting in a lower number of patients being referred to higher-level hospitals, and reduced requirements for standard reimbursements to troop-contributing governments for self-sustainment owing to the lower actual deployment of military contingent personnel than planned. The unspent balance was partly offset by increased requirements for medical supplies resulting from the higher actual incumbency of civilian staff than planned. 39. The unutilized balance was attributable mainly to reduced requirements for standard reimbursements to troop-contributing governments for self-sustainment owing to the lower actual deployment of military contingent personnel. In addition, the unspent balance was the result of reduced requirements for the acquisition of observation equipment owing to the availability of equipment from existing stock. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 40. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNIFIL are: (a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $17,900 with respect to the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011; (b) To decide on the treatment of other income/adjustments for the period ended 30 June 2011 amounting to $28,857,500 from interest income ($7,279,500), other/miscellaneous income ($1,294,600) and cancellation of prior-period obligations ($20,293,500), offset by prior-period adjustments ($10,100). VI. Summary of follow-up action taken to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions endorsed by the General Assembly (A/65/743/Add.9) Recommendations and requests to the Secretary-General Action taken to implement decisions and requests The Advisory Committee recalls that the majority of the proposed staffing changes for 2010/11 were in connection with the mission's rationalization efforts (A/64/660/Add.14, para. 36). In this connection, the Committee notes from the Secretary-General's proposed budget that the mission's support component is undergoing restructuring in 2010/11 based on the rationalization of tasks and that the centralized approach to service delivery has proven to be more effective and efficient (A/65/756, para. 16). The Committee expects that the results achieved, including efficiency gains, and lessons learned from the rationalization exercise will be reported in the performance report for 2010/11 (para. 34). Implemented. The present report reflects that aspects of the efficiency gains have been addressed. The Force abolished a total of 104 posts in the 2010/11 budget period (with the establishment of 4 new posts, the overall net decrease was 100 posts). In addition, UNIFIL nationalized 3 international posts and reassigned positions from areas where redundancy/duplication of tasks was identified to areas requiring additional support. The Personnel Section of UNIFIL has undergone a restructuring with a view to improving the efficiency, effectiveness and client-servicing orientation of the Force. Units have been merged and restructured in order to ensure that there is a clear division of work and line of accountability, as well as maximum capacity-building for national staff. A separate unit in the Personnel Section was established to focus on classification and post management and has been instrumental in resolving a number of classification-related matters and informing staff. These developments, which have resulted from human resources rationalization exercises, have greatly improved the efficiency of the Force in dealing with recruitment and personnel-related matters. During the 2010/11 period, the Regional Communications and Information Technology Services structure was established to coordinate the delivery of information and communications technology services through regional management in order to eliminate duplication of effort, to create economies of scale, to enhance disaster recovery and crisis management and to reduce operational risk and remove the disparity of service across missions. In addition, with respect to the restructuring of the Force's support component, the following activities have been implemented: (a) the pool of Language Assistants has been moved from the Sector Administrative Office to the Joint Logistics Operations Centre as the principal interface and entry point for support requests originating from the military component. This action was based on an internal review of language requirements conducted by the Mission Support Division, which resulted in the consolidation of resources based on the shift in focus from the pool of resources to the core tasks performed by Language Assistants; (b) the Force made significant progress in the development of its logistics infrastructure, including the consolidation of warehousing arrangements, and the creation of a safe environment for takeoff and landing operations of its fleet of helicopters; (c) other infrastructure works have focused on improving the welfare and recreation conditions of Force personnel, particularly senior military personnel and 237 military staff officers; and (d) the Force consolidated its oversight of asset lifecycle functions in the Property Management Section/Integrated Support Services for improved management of asset disposal.
