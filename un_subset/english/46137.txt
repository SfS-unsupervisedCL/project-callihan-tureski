Requests the Committee to intensify its review of its working methods in order to enhance the efficiency and quality of its proceedings, with the aim of achieving timely consideration of reports submitted by States parties, and also requests the Committee to review and assess its progress in order to provide an update on this question in its report to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session and inputs to the evaluation to be made by the Office of the High Commissioner, taking into account the wider context of treaty body reform. 74th plenary meeting 24 December 2008
