To negotiate an instrument on post-conflict remedial measures of a generic nature which would reduce the risks of ERW. These measures would be based on a broad definition covering most types of explosive munitions, with the exception of mines. Abandoned munitions would have to be included. In these negotiations, questions need to be considered regarding, inter alia, responsibility for clearance, existing ERW, the provision of information to facilitate clearance and risk education, warnings to civilian populations, assistance & co-operation, and a framework for regular consultations of High Contracting Parties. These negotiations would have to establish the scope of this instrument consistent with Article I of the Convention as amended at its 2nd Review Conference. 1b. To explore and determine whether these negotiations could successfully address preventive generic measures for improving the reliability of munitions that fall within the agreed broad definition, through voluntary best practices concerning the management of manufacturing, quality control, handling and storage of munitions. Exchange of information, assistance and co-operation would be important elements of such best practices. Separate from the negotiations under 1): to continue to consider the implementation of existing principles of International Humanitarian Law and to further study, on an open ended basis, possible preventive measures aimed at improving the design of certain specific types of munitions, including sub-munitions, with a view to minimise the humanitarian risk of these munitions becoming ERW. Exchange of information, assistance and co-operation would be part of this work. In the context of the activities described above, meetings of military experts can be conducted to provide advice in support of these activities. MINES OTHER THAN ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES The Working Group on Mines Other Than Anti-Personnel Mines recommends to the States Parties that it would continue its work in the year 2003 with the following mandate: 1. To continue to explore the issue of mines other than anti-personnel mines. The group shall consider the most appropriate way to reduce the risks posed by the irresponsible use of mines other than anti-personnel mines, including the possibility to conclude a negotiating mandate for a new instrument and other appropriate measures. The Group of Governmental Experts shall take into account: the necessity to strike the right balance between humanitarian concerns and military utility of MOTAPM; existing restrictions on such mines in Amended Protocol II to the CCW; technical and other measures aimed at minimizing the humanitarian risks posed by such mines as well as the modalities for their effective implementation, such as international cooperation and assistance, transition periods etc.; questions involving the use of MOTAPM by non-state actors; any question involving other aspects of such mines. 2. In the context of the activities described above, meetings of military experts can be conducted to provide advice in support of these activities.
