UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1997/953/Add.1 17 December 1997 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ON THE UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL ADMINISTRATION FOR EASTERN SLAVONIA, BARANJA AND WESTERN SIRMIUM Addendum 1. In my report to the Security Council dated 4 December 1997 (S/1997/953) I indicated in paragraph 40 that, an addendum to the report containing the financial aspects of establishing a support group of civilian police monitors to continue to monitor the performance of the Croatian police in the Danube region would be issued shortly. 2. The estimated costs associated with the operation of the civilian police support group for a period of nine months would amount to approximately $17.6 million. This estimate provides for a strength of 180 civilian police, supported by a civilian establishment of 53 international and 165 local personnel. 3. A breakdown of the estimated financial requirements is provided by main category of expenditure, for information purposes, in the annex to the present addendum. Should the Security Council decide to authorize the establishment of a United Nations civilian police support group in Croatia, it would be my intention to recommend to the General Assembly that the costs relating thereto should be considered an expense of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations and that the assessments to be levied on Member States be credited to a Special Account established for this purpose.
