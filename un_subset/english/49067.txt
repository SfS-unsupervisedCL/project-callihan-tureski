Sixty-fourth session * A/64/50. Item 132 of the preliminary list* Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations Multi-year payment plans Report of the Secretary-General Summary In its resolution 57/4 B, the General Assembly endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee on Contributions concerning multi-year payment plans, and in its resolutions 58/1 B, 59/1 B, 60/237 and 61/237 it reaffirmed that endorsement. In that connection, the Committee recommended that the Secretary-General be requested to provide information on the submission of such plans to the Assembly, through the Committee on Contributions. It also recommended that the Secretary-General be requested to submit an annual report to the Assembly, through the Committee on Contributions, on the status of the payment plans of Member States as at 31 December each year. The present report is submitted in compliance with those requests and provides information on payment plans/schedules submitted earlier by Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe and Tajikistan and on the status of implementation of those plans as at 31 December 2008. The General Assembly may wish to take note of the present report and encourage Member States with significant arrears in contributions to consider submitting a multi-year payment plan. 1. In its resolution 56/243 A, the General Assembly recognized that multi-year payment plans, subject to careful formulation, could be helpful in allowing Member States to demonstrate their commitment under Article 19 of the Charter of the United Nations to pay their arrears, thereby facilitating the consideration of applications for exemption by the Committee on Contributions, and requested the Secretary-General to propose guidelines for such multi-year payment plans through the Committee on Contributions. 2. After considering the report of the Secretary-General on multi-year payment plans at its sixty-second session, in 2002, the Committee on Contributions agreed that Member States should be encouraged to submit such plans, which constitute a useful tool for reducing their unpaid assessed contributions and a way for them to demonstrate their commitment to meeting their financial obligations to the United Nations. The Committee recognized in that regard that due consideration should be given to the economic position of Member States, as not all of them might be in a position to submit such plans, and recommended that multi-year payment plans should remain voluntary and should not be automatically linked to other measures. 3. The Committee also recommended that Member States considering a multi-year payment plan submit such plans to the Secretary-General for the information of other Member States and be encouraged to consult the Secretariat for advice in their preparation. In that context, it was suggested that the plans of Member States: (a) Provide for annual payment of current-year assessments and a part of their arrears; (b) Where possible, generally provide for the elimination of arrears within a period of up to six years. 4. The Committee further recommended that the Secretary-General be requested to provide information on the submission of payment plans to the General Assembly, through the Committee, and that the Secretary-General also be requested to submit an annual report to the Assembly, through the Committee, on the status of such plans as at 31 December each year. 5. The Committee also recommended that, for those Member States that are in a position to submit a payment plan, the Committee and the General Assembly take the submission of a plan and its status of implementation into account as one factor when they consider requests for exemption under Article 19 of the Charter. 6. In paragraph 1 of its resolution 57/4 B, the General Assembly endorsed the above conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Committee. In its resolutions 58/1 B, 59/1 B, 60/237 and 61/237, the Assembly reaffirmed paragraph 1 of resolution 57/4 B. Accordingly, the Secretary-General has submitted annual reports on multi-year payment plans to the General Assembly since its fifty-eighth session. II. Submission of multi-year payment plans 7. Payment plans or schedules were submitted by Liberia in 2006 (its second), Georgia in 2003 (its fourth), Iraq in 2005 (its first), the Niger in 2004 (its first), Moldova in 2001 (its third), Sao Tome and Principe in 2002 (its first) and Tajikistan in 2000 (its first). As noted in the report of the Committee at its sixty-seventh session, both Georgia and the Niger had fully paid their arrears during the first half of 2007, thereby resulting in full implementation of their plans in advance of the deadline dates specified in the fifth annual report. The schedule last proposed by the Government of Moldova, as outlined in the fourth annual report, was fully implemented in 2005. A lump-sum payment by Iraq in 2005 also resulted in full implementation of its plan in advance of the deadline dates specified in the fourth annual report. 8. In the announcement concerning the sixty-ninth session of the Committee on Contributions, to be included in the Journal of the United Nations from 2 March to 15 May 2009, the Secretariat has invited Member States considering the submission of a multi-year payment plan to contact the Secretariat for further information. In addition, in the note issued pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 60/237 concerning the application of Article 19 of the Charter, attention was drawn to the provisions of resolution 57/4 B. Should any other payment plans be submitted, related information will be provided in an addendum to the present report or in the report of the Committee to be submitted to the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. 9. The plans submitted by Sao Tome and Principe and Tajikistan had durations of 8 and 11 years, respectively. For the purposes of the present report, payments are taken to include cash payments by the Member States concerned, together with the application of any credits to their accounts arising during the period concerned. Related information is provided below. Liberia 10. In a letter dated 12 July 2005, the National Transitional Government of Liberia submitted a payment schedule by which it proposed to make a contribution in the amount of $50,000 every two months, beginning in October 2005. In a letter dated 19 May 2006, the Government of Liberia submitted a revised payment plan taking into account the current level of national revenues and priorities. The new plan called for quarterly payments starting in June 2006. The payment schedules are as follows: (United States dollars) Schedule proposed in a b a Payment of $50,000 every two months beginning in October 2005. b Payment proposals to be submitted annually. 11. In the letter transmitting the payment plan of 19 May 2006, the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Liberia to the United Nations indicated that the Permanent Mission would submit a revised payment plan for 2007 in January 2007. At its sixty-seventh session, a representative of Liberia informed the Committee that a revised multi-year payment plan would be submitted beginning in July 2007. As at the date of the writing of the present report, a revised plan has not yet been submitted. Sao Tome and Principe 12. Under cover of his letter of 17 May 2002 addressed to the President of the General Assembly, the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of Sao Tome and Principe to the United Nations submitted the calendar of future payments as follows: Payment 13. If fully implemented, the schedule proposed by the Government of Sao Tome and Principe would involve payments totalling $694,411. If that amount is received during the period from 2002 to 2009, it will reduce the outstanding assessed contributions of Sao Tome and Principe at the end of 2009 to its total assessments for 2009 plus $68,048. Tajikistan 14. In his letter of 15 September 2000 to the President of the General Assembly, the Prime Minister of Tajikistan indicated that his Government had paid $65,250.76 in 2000 and proposed a plan for the phased reduction of its arrears, as follows: 15. If fully implemented, the schedule proposed by the Government of Tajikistan would involve payments totalling $1,421,694. If that amount, which has already been exceeded, had been received during the period from 2000 to 2010, it would have reduced the outstanding assessed contributions of Tajikistan at the end of 2010 to $1,298,031 plus its total assessments during the period from 2009 to 2010. Other Member States 16. While no other Member States have so far submitted payment plans or schedules for the elimination of their arrears, the Committee on Contributions reported at its sixty-eighth session on information received, in the context of requests for exemption under Article 19 of the Charter, regarding consideration being given to submission of multi-year payment plans. The Central African Republic indicated that it was reviewing ways and means of developing a multi-year payment plan. The Comoros indicated that it would keep the issue of multi-year payment plans under continuous consideration and, as the country's situation normalized, would establish such a plan as a matter of priority. Guinea-Bissau indicated that it was seriously looking at the possibility of making a partial payment within the framework of a multi-year payment plan. At the date of writing of the present report, no payment plan has yet been submitted in these instances. III. Status of payment plans of Member States as at 31 December 2008 17. The status of implementation of the most recent payment plans submitted by Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe and Tajikistan as at 31 December 2008 is summarized in the table on the status of payment plans. The plans proposed by Georgia, Iraq, Moldova and the Niger have been excluded, as those Member States have made the payments envisaged in their payment plans and no longer fall under the provisions of Article 19 of the Charter. Status of payment plans as at 31 December 2008 Payment plan Assessments as at 31 December Payments/ credits Outstanding as at 31 December 18. The Government of Tajikistan has once again significantly exceeded the payments and credits for the period from 2000 to 2008 foreseen in its schedule. Payments and credits totalling $2,595,532 were applied during that period, compared with the anticipated payments totalling $1,014,760 for those years set out in its schedule. In fact, the payments and credits applied already exceed the total amount foreseen in Tajikistan's schedule. Were the Government of Tajikistan nevertheless to make the payments currently indicated in its schedule for the period from 2009 to 2010 (a total of $406,934), its outstanding assessed contributions at the end of 2010 would amount to its assessments during the period from 2009-2010 less $249,741. 19. Payments by the Government of Sao Tome and Principe have fallen below the level foreseen for the period from 2002 to 2008 in its schedule of payments. Payments and credits totalling $33,572 were applied during that period, compared with the anticipated payments totalling $540,659 for those years set out in its schedule. As a result, were the Government of Sao Tome and Principe to make the payments currently indicated in its schedule for 2009 ($153,752), its outstanding assessed contributions at the end of 2009 would amount to its assessments for 2009 plus $575,135. 20. As regards Liberia, payments and credits in 2006 totalled $100,453, falling below the anticipated payments totalling $150,000 for that year set out in the last payment plan submitted. In 2007 and 2008, payments and credits totalling $100,660 and $200,323 respectively were applied. Liberia's outstanding assessed contributions at 31 December 2008 amounted to $878,234. IV. Conclusions and recommendations 21. The General Assembly may wish to take note of the present report and encourage Member States with significant arrears in contributions to consider submitting a multi-year payment plan.
