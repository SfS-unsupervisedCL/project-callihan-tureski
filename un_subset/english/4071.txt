It has been fifty years since the establishment of the first United Nations observer mission, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. We pay tribute to the hundreds of thousands of men and women who have, in the past fifty years, served under the United Nations flag in more than forty peacekeeping operations around the world, and we honour the memory of more than 1,500 United Nations peacekeepers who have laid down their lives in the cause of peace. We reiterate our support for all efforts effectively to promote the safety and security of United Nations peacekeeping personnel. We recall with pride the awarding of the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the peacekeeping forces of the United Nations, and we welcome the establishment by the Security Council of the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Medal as a tribute to the sacrifice of those who have lost their lives while serving in peacekeeping operations under the operational control and authority of the United Nations. We, the Member States of the United Nations, affirm our commitment and willingness to provide full support to United Nations peacekeepers to ensure that they are able successfully to fulfil the tasks entrusted to them.
