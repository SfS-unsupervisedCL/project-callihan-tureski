Draft resolution II. Draft revised calendar of conferences and meetings of the United Nations and of the principal organs of the specialized agencies, the International Atomic Energy Agency and treaty bodies established under the auspices of the United Nations for 2004-2005 Chapter I A. Membership 1. The General Assembly, in its resolution 43/222 B, decided to retain the Committee on Conferences as a permanent subsidiary organ. Pursuant to the provisions of that resolution, in 2003 the Committee was composed of the following Member States: Argentina, Austria, Benin, Bolivia, Congo, Ethiopia, Finland, France, India, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Nepal, Peru, Russian Federation, Sierra Leone, Tunisia, United States of America and Zambia. B. Officers 2. At its organizational session for 2003, the Committee elected the following officers to serve in 2003: Chairman: Mohammad Tal (Jordan) Vice-Chairpersons: Guillermo E. Kendall (Argentina) Mikael Raivio (Finland) Rafla M'Rabet (Tunisia) Rapporteur: Andrius Namaviƒçius (Lithuania) 3. At the same meeting, the Committee agreed in principle that the Chairman would undertake informal consultations with a view to determining the composition of the Committee's Bureau in 2004. C. Organization of work 4. At its organizational session (449th meeting), the Committee agreed to follow the guidelines adopted in 1994 and 1995 with regard to consideration of intersessional departures from the approved calendar of conferences and to meet, as required, to review proposals affecting the schedule of conferences and meetings during sessions of the General Assembly. 5. The Committee convened its substantive session on 8, 10 and 12 September 2003 (451st through 456th meetings). 6. The Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management addressed the Committee at the opening of its organizational and substantive sessions. At the substantive session, he introduced the report of the Secretary-General on reform of the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (A/58/213) and the proposed programme budget of the Department for the biennium 2004-2005 (A/58/6 (Sect. 2)). 7. The report of the Secretary-General on the pattern of conferences (A/58/194) was introduced by a representative of the Secretariat. The consolidation into one report of all matters of a technical nature, an innovation in 2002, was continued in 2003. D. Programme of work 8. At its organizational session for 2002, held on 22 March 2002, the Committee had requested the Secretariat to submit a draft agenda for 2003 to the Committee at its organizational session for 2003. At the 449th meeting, on 22 April 2003, the Committee adopted the proposed agenda (A/AC.172/2003/1) and requested the Secretariat to submit a draft agenda for 2004 to the Committee at its organizational session for 2004. 9. In order to provide more relevant advice to the General Assembly, the Committee decided to recommend for adoption by the General Assembly elements of a draft resolution reflecting the substantive discussion that took place in the Committee, thereby facilitating the consideration of the item by the Assembly (see A/AC.172/2003/CRP.2/Add.12). E. Participation of observers 10. The following States Members of the United Nations were represented as observers: Algeria, Belgium, Canada, China, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Germany, Ireland, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 11. At its 454th meeting, on 10 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered the question of participation of observers. The question was given particular attention during the informal drafting meetings of the Committee. Some delegations held the view that the widest possible participation was desirable and that it would be reasonable to allow observers to present drafting proposals during informal consultations. Other delegations held the view that the distinction between Committee members and observers should be maintained and that a drafting group confined to members would be more efficient and appropriate. 12. Interested delegations were encouraged to consider seeking membership in the Committee. F. Biennialization of the item entitled "Pattern of conferences" in the agenda of the General Assembly 13. At its 454th meeting, on 10 September 2003, the Committee considered the possibility of biennializing the item entitled "Pattern of conferences" in the agenda of the General Assembly. 14. Delegations expressed interest in the idea and some supported it. At the same time, it was noted that since the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management was in the midst of an important reform that warranted annual monitoring by the General Assembly, the time was not ripe. It was also stressed by some delegations that given the importance and wide scope of the activities in this area, an annual review of the item was considered necessary. It was concluded that possible biennialization of the agenda item would require further thought. Conclusions 15. The Committee concluded that its current procedures should be retained, on the understanding that observers could present their proposals in formal meetings. The Committee welcomed the active participation of observers. A. Matters related to and intersessional departures from the approved calendar for 2003 1. The General Assembly, in its resolution 57/283 A, approved the revised calendar of conferences and meetings of the United Nations for 2003 as submitted by the Committee on Conferences and amended by subsequent decisions taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. The calendar was issued as document A/AC.172/2003/2. 2. At its 373rd meeting, on 26 August 1994, the Committee had decided that requests for intersessional departures submitted to the Committee should in future be reviewed by the Bureau, in consultation with the Secretariat, for subsequent action. 3. At its 379th meeting, on 23 March 1995, the Committee had agreed that proposed changes to the calendar that did not have programme budget implications could be dealt with by the Secretariat, in consultation with the Bureau of the Committee. 4. At its substantive session of 1995, the Committee had decided that requests for intersessional departures submitted to the Committee that involved a change of venue should be referred to the members for approval. Departures that involved other types of changes, as the Committee had decided at its substantive session of 1994, should be reviewed by the Bureau, in consultation with the Secretariat, for subsequent action. 5. The requests submitted in 2003 for changes of venue or additional sessions/ meetings and the action taken by the Committee are set out below. Organ Request Action taken Commission on the Status of Women To convene one additional meeting on 25 March 2003 to conclude the work of its 47th session. Owing to time constraints on the scheduled final day of the session, the Commission was not able to take action on one proposal or elect the new Bureau for the following session. Request approved United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund Committee of Actuaries To hold its session from 2 to 4 June 2003 in Geneva instead of New York. The Fund has an office in Geneva and meetings have been held there in the past. Conference Services in Geneva were able to accommodate the request. Fifth Committee To hold two additional meetings of the Committee, one informal and one formal, on 2 and 4 June 2003, respectively, to take action on the draft proposals before it and to conclude its work for the session. Group of Governmental Experts on Tracing Small Arms and Light Weapons To convene its first session in Geneva from 1 to 5 July 2003 rather than in New York from 20 to 24 May 2003. Since some members of the Group were to participate in the meeting of the Open-Ended Group of Governmental Experts of States Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons scheduled in Geneva from 20 to 24 May 2003, it would have been impossible for them to also attend the meeting in New York. Conference Services in Geneva confirmed that they could accommodate the meeting on the dates requested in July. Committee for Programme and Coordination To hold one additional formal meeting on 9 July 2003 to conclude its work for the session. Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters To convene the forty-first session of the Board from 16 to 18 July 2003 in Geneva rather than New York in order to give members the opportunity to confer with participants in the Conference on Disarmament. Moreover, since the Board also serves as the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, the Geneva venue permits the Board members to be in close contact with the staff of the Institute. Group of Governmental Experts on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development To hold its first session from 17 to 21 November 2003 in Geneva. Owing to scheduling conflicts in the substantive office, the session could only be held on those dates, which fall during the regular session of the General Assembly when services could not be confirmed in New York. Conference Services in Geneva were able to accommodate the request. Ad Hoc Group of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters To hold their eleventh meeting in Geneva from 15 to 19 December 2003. The Group of Experts often meets in Geneva to accommodate its members and observers based there, as well as to enable a larger participation at a lower cost. International Civil Service Commission To hold its fifty-sixth session at FAO headquarters in Rome, rather than Bangkok, which itself constituted an exception to General Assembly resolution 40/243 but had been approved when the calendar was compiled. The venue was changed again owing to concerns of participants about the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the South-East Asia region. B. Adoption of the draft biennial calendar of conferences and meetings for 2004-2005 Introduction and overview 6. At its 452nd meeting, on 8 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences reviewed the draft biennial calendar of conferences and meetings for 2004-2005 (A/AC.172/2003/CRP.1 and Add.1), which was introduced by a representative of the Secretariat. The Committee was informed that the calendar had been prepared in accordance with all the principles established for its design. With regard to General Assembly resolution 53/208 A, in which the Assembly decided that United Nations bodies should be invited to avoid holding meetings on Orthodox Good Friday, only one body, the Commission on Human Rights, had found it necessary to schedule a meeting on Orthodox Good Friday during the biennium in order to be able to complete the work of its session. Although reminded of the relevant General Assembly rule pertaining to the venue of meetings, specifically as it relates to Nairobi, and the desirability of fuller utilization of Nairobi conference facilities, the United Nations Environment Programme had accepted the offer of the Republic of Korea to host the eighth special session of the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum in 2004, in keeping with its decision 20/17 of 5 February 1999 to hold the session in alternate years in different regions on a rotating basis. Consideration of the draft biennial calendar of conferences and meetings of subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Council for 2004-2005 7. At its 450th meeting, on 26 June 2003, during its organizational session, the Committee on Conferences had considered the draft biennial calendar of conferences and meetings of subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Council for 2004-2005 and had submitted its observations to the Council accordingly. Conclusions and recommendations 8. On the understanding that the budgetary implications of certain items, such as the decisions and recommendations of the Economic and Social Council adopted at its 2003 substantive session and included in the calendar, would be reviewed by the responsible legislative bodies, and that any adjustments to the calendar of conferences and meetings for 2004-2005 that might become necessary as a result of actions and decisions taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session would be made, the Committee recommended that the General Assembly approve the calendar. 1. Meeting statistics of United Nations organs and consultations with and/or letters to bodies concerning utilization of the conference services available to them 9. At its 452nd meeting, on 8 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences reviewed the statistical data given in section II.B(1) and annex I of the Secretary-General's report on pattern of conferences (A/58/194 and Corr.1 and Corr.2) on the planned and actual utilization of conference resources allocated to a core sample of bodies that had met in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi in 2002, and considered an oral report by the Chairman of the Committee on his consultations with bodies concerning utilization of the conference services available to them. In keeping with section II.A, paragraph 16, of General Assembly resolution 57/283 B, 12 bodies had been identified that had consistently utilized less than the applicable benchmark figure of their allocated resources during their previous three sessions. The Chairman and the Department had held consultations with or sent letters to the chairpersons and secretariats of those bodies in an effort to resolve the problem. 10. Underutilization of conference-servicing resources resulted in some cases from meetings being cancelled too late to schedule another meeting into the time slot, often a sign that planning accuracy could be improved. A persistent pattern of cancellations could be resolved either by shortening the duration of the body's session or reducing the scheduled number of meetings within the same time frame. That solution had been successful, for example, with the Committee on Contributions. 11. For some of the organs concerned, however, late starts or early endings were the main cause of low utilization. In some cases, the problem could be resolved by convening meetings in a timely manner, without a quorum, if necessary, and having ready additional items if consideration of an agenda item should be concluded sooner than anticipated. The Sixth Committee had been successful with those methods. 12. In accordance with decisions of the Committee on Conferences, the time utilized for informal meetings or consultations held before the start or after the adjournment of officially scheduled meetings, when utilizing the same services and with due notification given to the Secretariat, was not included as time lost. However, several of the bodies had stressed that, given the sensitive and political aspect of their work, the capacity to hold informal consultations utilizing conference room facilities was also important. If time used in that manner were not deducted from time lost due to early adjournment in calculating the utilization factor, they would be hard pressed to raise their statistics above the benchmark figure. The Chairman suggested that the Committee should give serious consideration to certain mitigating factors in methodology. Discussion 13. Delegations expressed satisfaction with the efforts to hold discussions with underutilizers, since expensive resources were being wasted. A number of delegations felt that it was best to seek a solution tailored to the specific body, on a case-by-case basis, without necessarily changing the general methodology. Although reservations were expressed about being more lenient to some bodies than to others, it was also said that it was a matter of being adaptable, rather than lenient. The view was expressed that it was important to respect the principle of using all official languages, and it was not ideal to hold consultations without interpretation. It was also stated that, as much as possible, the time released from cancelled meetings or early adjournments should be made available to regional groups. 14. A representative of the Secretariat explained that, although there were as yet no benchmarks established for the planning accuracy factor, the Department had found it to be a useful tool in its discussions with underutilizers since, given sufficient notice, it was easier to reschedule a whole block of meeting time than a fragment. 15. The Committee noted that the overall utilization factor for the four United Nations offices in 2002, 75 per cent, was one percentage point higher than in 2001, but still six percentage points lower than in 2000. The slight improvement in 2002 was reflected in three of the duty stations and was due solely to a decrease in time lost owing to late starts and early endings, the sharp increase in this figure having been the cause of the 7 per cent drop in utilization from 2000 to 2001. There was very little change in the number of cancellations. 16. The Committee also noted that the 75 per cent utilization factor was five percentage points lower than the benchmark figure established by the General Assembly and was still an unacceptable loss of resources. The Chairman of the Committee again conducted consultations with the chairpersons and/or secretaries of the bodies that had underutilized for three years in a row, urging them to consider changes in their programme of work and to introduce more discipline into the way they conducted their business. In 2003, however, several bodies had stressed the need to bring into the equation the informal consultations that often took place after a formal meeting was adjourned, as noted in the Chairman's oral report on meetings with those bodies consistently underutilizing their resources. 17. The Committee requested the Chairman to continue to consult on its behalf with the chairpersons of bodies that had consistently utilized less than the applicable benchmark figure of their allocated resources for the past three sessions, pursuant to the requests of the General Assembly set out in section B, paragraphs 6 and 7, of its resolution 54/248, with a view to making appropriate recommendations in order to achieve the optimum utilization of conference-servicing resources. 18. The Committee was of the opinion that certain factors, such as the planning accuracy factor, which was a relevant planning tool for the Secretariat, should be taken into consideration when judging individual bodies. 19. At its 453rd meeting, on 10 September 2003, the Committee considered the statistical data and analysis contained in annex II and paragraphs 17 to 36 of the Secretary-General's report on pattern of conferences (A/58/194, Corr.1, Corr.2) and covering the period from May 2002 to April 2003. Overall, for the four duty stations, the percentage of meetings held by regional and other major groupings that were provided with interpretation for the reporting period had decreased to 92 per cent from 98 per cent over the same period in 2001/2002, a drop of six percentage points. However, the percentage was on a par with the rate in 2000/2001 and higher than the rate of 84 per cent in 1999/2000. 20. Regret was expressed over the slippage in the rate of provision of interpretation services to meetings of regional and other major groupings of Member States, since such meetings, held to enable such groups to consult and arrive at consensus on agenda items, greatly facilitated the work of the Main Committees and other bodies. The report had mentioned several options for providing more predictable and adequate conference services to such meetings, and the costing study on those options was in the final stages of preparation. 21. The view was also expressed that the system appeared to be working rather well. With adaptability on the part of the Secretariat and the requesting groups the percentage could be improved, although it could be difficult, particularly for a large group like the Group of 77 and China, to adapt to last-minute changes. Ultimately, a delicate balance would have to be struck between the needs of the regional groups and the availability of services. 22. The Committee was unable to consider the proposals concerning the provision of conference services to regional and other major groupings on a more predictable basis in the absence of the report of the Secretary-General on their cost implications, which is pending. 3. Improved utilization of conference facilities (a) United Nations Office at Nairobi 23. At its 453rd meeting, on 10 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered the report on the improved utilization of conference facilities at the United Nations Office at Nairobi contained in paragraph 37 of the report of the Secretary-General on pattern of conferences (A/58/194 and Corr.1 and 2). 24. The Committee was informed that a report on the matter had been issued in document A/57/809, and that further reporting on the considerations of improving and modernizing the conference facilities at Nairobi would be done through the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in accordance with established procedures. 25. Concern was expressed at the apparent inadequacy of resources for conference services at Nairobi and the factors that made it difficult for the duty station to attract and retain language professionals, particularly for posts funded from extrabudgetary resources. 26. The Committee took note that further reporting on the considerations of improving and modernizing the conference facilities at Nairobi would be done through the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in accordance with established procedures. (b) Conference centre at the Economic Commission for Africa 27. At its 453rd meeting, on 10 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered the report on the conference centre at the Economic Commission for Africa contained in paragraphs 38 to 46 of the report of the Secretary-General on the pattern of conferences (A/58/194 and Corr.1, Corr.2). 28. The Committee on Conferences expressed appreciation that in 2002 the Economic Commission for Africa had reorganized its conference centre along the lines of international best practice, establishing a Conference Coordination Unit that enabled it to better respond to the needs of its clients and an Integrated Conference Management System to further enhance the provision of services. As a result, occupancy at the centre had gone up by more than 80 per cent over the previous year, an increase that was being maintained in 2003. 29. The Committee noted that plans to integrate all operating phases into one system and to promote the centre further were envisaged for the near future. 4. Improving the performance of the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management 30. At its 451st and 452nd meetings, on 8 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered the report of the Secretary-General on the reform of the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (A/58/213). In introducing the report, the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management noted that implementation of the Department's comprehensive and results-oriented reform plan was in full swing. The Department's budgetary position was sound and more rational meeting schedules had led to better smoother meetings programmes, utilization of resources and higher staff morale. Enforcement of the slotting system had resulted in initial improvement in the documents situation and in enhanced awareness on the part of author departments of the need for timely submission. The Journal was now a convenient tool for accessing information on meetings and meeting-related documents. The electronic meetings planning system (e-Meets) was operational and was soon to be expanded, while the electronic documentation processing system (e-Conveyor) had been tested and a prototype was expected to be operational by the end of 2003. Considerable attention was also being paid to enhancing synergy and extending it beyond the Department to include the other Secretariat entities and intergovernmental bodies. 31. Building on its success, the Department was embarking on a number of major new projects, including a comprehensive study on the integrated global management of conference-related resources covering the four duty stations to be undertaken in collaboration with the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and with the full involvement of the duty stations. The study was aimed at developing guidelines for integrated global management that were consistent with the applicable legislative and administrative mandates, and would also recommend an operating model for the central monitoring and coordination mechanisms. 32. In response to General Assembly resolution 57/283 B, in which the Assembly had recognized the need to develop or update existing workload standards so as to reflect functions performed by language staff not currently included in those standards, the Department had also established a task force to undertake a comprehensive review of existing workload standards and performance measurements. A crucial issue in that respect was the relationship between the introduction of technological innovations and productivity gains and the related issue of return on investment. 33. In implementing the slotting system, it had become clear that the length of reports was no less important for the success of the system than submission dates. The Department would therefore continue to strictly enforce the limits on the length of reports originating in the Secretariat and would set up a task force to look at ways of dealing with reports that were not within the purview of the Secretary-General. 34. Reform was a dynamic process, however, which could be affected by unforeseeable organizational, financial, technical and human factors. Consequently, during the process of implementation, the plan was being fine-tuned or even modified on the basis of experience gained and lessons learned. Repositioning the Department 35. The view was expressed that the new results-driven approach to conference management should not obscure the fact that the function of the Department was to provide a range of services to the intergovernmental bodies. The need for the Department to react to the demands of those bodies must therefore be reconciled with its new proactive approach. It was explained that the Department fully recognized the need for balance. The ability to plan ahead, however, enabled it to deliver its services more effectively and within its budget. 36. Satisfaction was expressed at the curtailment of night and weekend meetings and at the initial improvement in the timeliness of submission of documents by author entities. Further improvement, however, was still needed. 37. While some members welcomed the Department's efforts to reduce documentation and enhance efficiency through the consolidation of reports, others were of the view that the Department was required to follow existing mandates in the area of conference management and that the consolidation of reports was not within its purview. It was explained that, while the Department sought, where possible, to combine reports of a similar nature, it did so without eliminating mandates and, where necessary, with the authorization of the body concerned. Pursuing full-system benefits 38. A number of questions were asked about the transition to an electronic documentation workflow (e-flow), including how adjustments to the sequence of processing in the documents-processing chain had affected the way in which editors worked. It was explained that e-flow involved the electronic transmission of documents as well as related reference material and terminology in all official languages through every stage of the documents-processing chain so as to reduce the time required to move documents down the processing line and, in some instances, to reduce workload downstream. The Department had issued operational guidelines that made computer skills a necessary requirement for all newly recruited staff involved in the documents chain and had developed a detailed training plan for permanent staff members. 39. Support was expressed for the integration of the technical-servicing secretariats of the Fifth and Sixth Committees into the Department as a way to enhance their efficiency. The contrary view was also expressed, however, that delegations were satisfied with the current performance of the technical secretariats and failed to understand the rationale for their integration into the Department. Integrating global management 40. In response to questions about the extent to which the integrated management of conference-related resources had succeeded in making the fullest and most rational use of available resources across duty stations, it was pointed out that the calendar of conferences and meetings approved by the General Assembly remained the most authoritative tool for the management of meetings. Other factors to be taken into account were the headquarters rule and the other costs associated with holding meetings at duty stations away from Headquarters. The availability of conference services was not the only consideration, especially if peaks in demand at a given duty station could be met from within the existing conference-servicing capacity of that duty station. The comprehensive study which the Department had launched in cooperation with OIOS to devise a practical approach to integrated global management based on a broad consensus among the concerned duty stations of what was desirable and practicable was due to be completed in December 2003. The view was also expressed that, independently of the process of integrating global management, those principles and methods that had proven to be successful should be applied across duty stations. 41. In response to the question of whether the use of two incompatible information tracking systems, the Electronic Document Registration and Information Tracking System (e-DRITS) and the integrated Documents Control and Productivity Monitoring System (iDCPMS), was an obstacle to the integration of global management across duty stations, it was explained that the Department's ability to plan and to communicate had in no way been hindered. 42. For the discussion and recommendations on this topic, see chapter VI below. Alleviating the documentation situation 43. An assessment was requested of the initial results of the implementation of the slotting system. It was pointed out that, while adjustments were still being made to the system, which had been introduced only the previous year, the Secretariat had generally responded to the pressure to meet slotting deadlines. As an upstream planning mechanism, the system was demonstrating that long-term planning was better than short-term reacting. 44. It was noted with satisfaction that in the first five months of 2003, over 90 per cent of reports originating in the Secretariat had been submitted in accordance with the established page limits. Given the high per page cost of processing documentation, however, the need for a 100 per cent compliance rate was emphasized. 45. Deep concern was expressed over the fact that, in an era of instant communications and fast-paced international relations, when, in order to be relevant, information needed to be transmitted instantly to capitals, summary records continued to be produced so late as to be useless for any purpose other than as a historical record. Unlike verbatim records and press releases, summary records had become a marginal product of the Department that was little used by Member States and indeed slowed down the reform process. Press releases, however, were not an acceptable substitute for summary records since they were not subject to the rule governing the simultaneous issuance of official documents in all six official languages. Similarly, given the Organization's other more urgent priorities, providing the six Translation Services with additional resources for the translation of summary records was out of the question. The Assembly should therefore conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis of the current approach to summary records, consider alternative approaches and review the list of bodies entitled to such records. The view was also expressed that the statement made in paragraph 42 of the report of the Secretary-General that the Assembly had not approved the Secretary-General's proposal for a study to be conducted on the potential of low-cost searchable digital recordings on the proceedings of meetings was not an accurate reflection of the Assembly's position on the matter. 46. It was pointed out that summary records were always prepared on time in the original language. The delay arose because of the chronic lack of capacity to translate them into the other five official languages. In view of the prohibitive cost of increasing that capacity to the required level, the Secretariat sought the Assembly's guidance on how the problem should be addressed since it could not unilaterally withdraw the entitlement to summary records that had been established by the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council for their respective subsidiary bodies. 47. It was pointed out that the pilot project for concordance of draft resolutions prior to their adoption by the plenary would be expanded to the Fourth and Sixth Committees. The current working methods of the other main committees and the plenary made it difficult to envisage the concordance of their draft resolutions prior to their adoption by the General Assembly. Since there was little time between adoption in the main committee and action by the plenary, the remaining committees could adopt the corresponding draft resolutions after they had completed their consideration of the item from which it emanated. Ensuring high-quality performance in the course of reform 48. Emphasis was placed on the need to ensure that the drive for greater efficiency and economies did not result in a decline in the quality of the service that the Department provided to Member States. The view was expressed that the Group of 77 and China did not always receive a level of service commensurate with its size and importance in the Organization. Commitment to high quality must be an inherent aspect of the Department's reform. In that connection, information was sought on the productivity gains resulting from greater efficiencies and the introduction of information technology that had permitted economies to be realized. In response, it was pointed out that the Department was committed to its mandate, which was to provide high-quality service as efficiently as possible. None of the savings realized had been the result of a lowering of the quality of service. 49. On the question of the current workload standards for language staff, satisfaction was expressed at the establishment of a task force to conduct a comprehensive study covering all major language-related functions, including interpretation and translation. Any new standards should include quantitative measurements of some kind and should reflect the gains in productivity that should accrue from investments in information technology for language staff. Pending the introduction of new standards, however, the existing standards must be observed. 50. Note was taken with satisfaction of the series of language-specific consultations organized by the Department in May 2003 to facilitate discussions between its language services and interested delegations on the terminology used at the United Nations. It was pointed out that, with specific reference to Chinese, the terminology used in the Organization did not always reflect current usage. Those consultations could also be used to initiate a dialogue between delegations and interpreters on issues relating to the quality of interpretation. 51. Assurances were sought from the Department that documents would be equally accessible in all official languages under the e-Flow system. It was pointed out that the system was used for the internal flow of manuscripts in the original language of submission. At the end of the processing chain, documents were issued in all of the official languages. 52. There was general support and agreement expressed concerning the conclusions contained in paragraphs 51 to 53 of the report (A/58/213) concerning the direction of the reform and the follow-up steps to be taken. Concerns were expressed that the high quality of services should be maintained in the process of the reform and that Member States should be assisted in the transition to the electronic submission and retrieval of documents. The Committee decided to formulate its recommendations on those issues in the proposed draft resolution (see annex I). D. Requests for exceptions to section I, paragraph 7, of General Assembly resolution 40/243 53. At its 451st meeting, on 8 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered chapter II, section C, and annex III of the report of the Secretary-General on the pattern of conferences (A/58/194 and Corr.1 and 2), concerning requests from subsidiary bodies for exceptions to be made to section I, paragraph 7, of General Assembly resolution 40/243, in which the Assembly had decided that no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly might meet at United Nations Headquarters during a regular session of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly. 54. The Committee was pleased to learn that the number of requests for exceptions had declined from seven in 2002 to four in 2003. It was noted that the four bodies in question had routinely sought the same exception for the same reasons, which were not likely to change, and the view was expressed that perhaps it would be sensible to grant them a permanent or at any rate a longer-term exception. On the other hand, it was explained that the requirement that subsidiary bodies must make the request for exception on an annual basis had provided the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management with an opportunity to discuss their real conference-servicing needs during a very high-volume period, leading in some cases to a reduction in demand. 55. The Committee recommended that the General Assembly explicitly authorize the following bodies to meet in New York during the main part of its fifty-eighth session, on the understanding that all such meetings would be allocated conference services on an as-available basis, from within existing resources, in such a way that the work of the General Assembly and its Main Committees would not be impeded: :: Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People :: Committee on Relations with the Host Country :: Working Group on the Financing of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East :: Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund. 56. The Committee noted with satisfaction the reduction in the requests for exceptions. 1. At its 453rd meeting, on 10 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered the report on documentation and publication-related matters contained in paragraphs 53 to 62 of the report of the Secretary-General on pattern of conferences (A/58/194 and Corr.1 and 2) and heard explanations from representatives of the Secretariat. 2. It was explained that, while the rules on availability of official documents made it clear that they must be posted only simultaneously on United Nations web sites, from a practical standpoint, given the time required to translate and issue the documents, some departments had opted to provide advance drafts for informal consultations or to post them on their web sites. For that reason, the instructions contained in paragraph 3.17 of administrative instruction ST/AI/2001/5 stated that advance texts and unedited draft or incomplete versions of parliamentary documentation should not be disseminated on the Internet, except in consultation with the Chairperson of the body concerned and its Secretary, and with an appropriate disclaimer. All instances of posting on web sites contrary to the rule of multilingualism investigated by the Department of Public Information were found to be by specific request of the bodies concerned. The Official Document System (ODS), on the other hand, was the sole electronic repository for the definitive texts in all official languages, which were always posted on it simultaneously. 3. Many delegations stressed that the rule of simultaneous distribution was well established and must be fully applied. Some delegations thought that the instructions in administrative instruction ST/AI/2001/5 and the posting of advance drafts "as a courtesy" to the body concerned appeared to be in contradiction to the official position. The view was expressed that for simultaneous availability in all languages on United Nations web sites to be timely substantial resources would be required. It was also said that the consolidation of reports, as called for in the context of the reform of the Department, should make simultaneous availability more timely. 4. Clarification was sought on the rationale for the statement in paragraph 62 of document A/58/194 and Corr.1 and 2 and the technical constraints involved. A representative of the Secretariat explained that the former practice of copying parliamentary documents to web sites from ODS was being replaced by a system of direct links to ODS, where the documents always appeared in all languages. However, resource and access limitations made it impossible at present to link all parliamentary documents to the web site. 1. At its 453rd and 454th meetings, on 10 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered the report on translation- and interpretation-related matters contained in paragraphs 69 and 70 of the report of the Secretary-General on pattern of conferences (A/58/194 and Corr.1 and 2) and heard explanations from representatives of the Secretariat. 2. Delegations expressed satisfaction at the reduction in vacancies in the Spanish language services from 28 to 16 and the filling of all six vacancies in the Chinese Translation Service at Headquarters and requested more complete data on vacancies in all language services. 3. The Committee was informed that competitive examinations in Arabic, English, French and Spanish were either completed or in progress, so that recruitment rosters could soon be increased. Concern was expressed about the number of retirements anticipated and about the working conditions in New York not being as attractive as in Europe. 4. Concerns were also expressed about occasional lapses in the quality of interpretation, and, in that regard, the usefulness of dialogue on terminology between interpreters and delegates, possibly through the format of language-specific informational meetings for delegations organized by the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management, was stressed. Department for General Assembly and Conference Management 1. At its 452nd meeting, on 8 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered the programme narrative on General Assembly affairs and conference services of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 (A/58/6 (Sect. 2)), programme 6 of the medium-term plan for the period 2004-2005, and heard an introduction by a representative of the Secretariat on the matter. 2. The Committee was informed that the proposed budget was based on the current reform and was intended to formalize the changes envisioned in the Secretary-General's report on improving the performance of the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (A/57/289). The first year of reform had already yielded tangible budgetary results. While the Department in New York had exceeded its initial appropriations by $11 million and $27.6 million in the biennia 1998-1999 and 2000-2001, it had been able to stay within its budget allotment in 2002 and expected to discharge all its functions by the end of 2003 within its 2002-2003 budgetary appropriation. 3. The salient features of the proposed budget were zero resource growth, redeployment of resources and an emphasis on information technology. It was cost-neutral in the short term, with increases in information technology resources being offset by decreases in staffing costs achieved by a shift from a resource-intensive, demand-driven approach to a management-intensive, results-oriented strategy. The proposed budget also entailed reclassifications to reflect realigned priorities and to integrate the technical secretariats of the Fifth and Sixth Committees into the Department. 4. The view was expressed that, without seeking to duplicate the work of the Fifth Committee, the Committee on Conferences had a mandate, based on General Assembly resolution 43/222, to look at the proposed budget from the standpoint of the pattern of conferences and to make recommendations to ensure the optimum utilization of conference-servicing resources. 5. Many delegations welcomed the improvement in the Department's budgetary situation. A number of delegations expressed the view that, while they were in favour of fiscal discipline, they were concerned that the reduction in staffing costs might result in a loss in the quality or quantity of services to Member States, for example, in a reduction in the servicing of meetings of regional groups. The representative of the Secretariat explained that the Department had achieved savings, and expected to do the same in the next biennium, not by cutting back on high-quality services but by shifting from crisis-style management to advanced planning. 6. It was noted that the proposed budget lacked performance measures in a number of areas. User satisfaction surveys were useful but were not a substitute for objective indicators in assessing the success of the Department's reforms. 7. The Committee recommended that the General Assembly give careful consideration to the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 for conference services, taking into account the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Committee concerning the relevant items on its agenda. 1. At its 451st, 452nd and 453rd meetings, on 8 and 10 September 2003, the Committee on Conferences considered the report of the Secretary-General on the pattern of conferences (A/58/194), paragraph 73, on information technology, and the report of the Secretary-General on the reform of the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (A/58/213), paragraphs 24 to 34, on optimizing the use of technology. 2. At its 453rd meeting, on 10 September 2003, the Chiefs of Conference Services and their senior staff at Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna participated in a videoconference arranged by the Committee on Conferences, in which they orally reported on the progress achieved in introducing new technology and optimizing its use in the meetings chain and throughout the documents chain at their respective duty stations. 3. It was emphasized that information technology was the driving force behind the Department's reform efforts. Among the objectives sought were the development of a common information technology strategy for all duty stations, including the standardization of databases. In order for that strategy to be effective, however, continuous training was necessary for users at all levels of the system. The current practice of sharing best experiences among duty stations should also be encouraged. 4. Satisfaction was expressed at the progress achieved in such areas as the electronic management of documents and meetings, the electronic submission of documents, printing on demand, and the new electronic version of the Journal of the United Nations, which offered real-time worldwide electronic access to all language versions of hyperlinked documents, including the daily list of documents issued at Headquarters. Given the uneven reliance on the electronic version of documents among individual users, hard copies would continue to be available for as long as they were needed by delegations. 5. While welcoming the assistance that was being provided to the United Nations Office at Nairobi by the other duty stations, some members expressed concern at a situation in which one duty station was not able to develop its own capacity in the field of information technology and had to rely on the other duty stations. The Secretariat responded and indicated its appreciation for the information technology assistance it received from the other duty stations. 6. The difficulties caused by the volume of summary records for the translation services and the efforts of the United Nations Office at Geneva were noted. The problem of the late issuance of summary records of meetings could be addressed by exploring the possibility of equipping off-site translators with multimedia workstations at which to follow and produce summary records of meetings of United Nations bodies. 7. It was requested that the Secretariat continue to provide the necessary assistance, including training, to requesting Member States to enable them to access and submit documents and information electronically.

Requests the Secretariat to continue to consult actively with the bureaux and secretariats of the bodies that consistently underutilize their conference-servicing resources with a view to making improvements in their utilization factors, bearing in mind that meetings are not to be held during off-hours and without interpretation; 4. Reaffirms that the provision of conference services for meetings and consultations of regional and other major groupings of Member States, to the maximum extent possible, facilitates the work of the Main Committees of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies; 5. Reaffirms its decision in section II.A, paragraph 14, of its resolution 57/283 B to include all necessary resources in the budget for the biennium 20042005 to provide interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings of Member States upon request by those groups, on an ad hoc basis, in accordance with established practice, and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, through the Committee on Conferences, a report on the implementation of that decision; B. Reform of the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management 1. Welcomes the initial steps taken by the Secretary-General in the implementation of the reform measures put forward in his report in accordance with section II.B of its resolution 57/283 B, and encourages the continued implementation of the measures described in paragraph 52 of his report on the reform of the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management, subject to the provisions of the present resolution; 2. Stresses that the reform of the Department should be aimed at improving the timely delivery of documentation and the quality of conference services provided to Member States with a view to meeting the needs of Member States as efficiently and effectively as possible and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly; 3. Notes that these measures will include a comprehensive study of the integrated global management of conference-related resources, in consultation with the Office of Internal Oversight Services and with the full participation of all duty stations in a collaborative and consultative process with a view to reaching conclusions that are both practical and comprehensive, and requests the Secretary-General to keep the Committee on Conferences informed on the matter; 4. Welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-General to improve the quality of reporting by consolidating reports on related subjects, writing more focused reports with clearly defined recommendations for action and observing stipulated page limits, and requests the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts in this regard in accordance with relevant mandates and in consultation with relevant intergovernmental bodies as appropriate, while ensuring that all mandated reports are issued for consideration, as requested, in a timely fashion and contain all the information requested; 5. Notes that reports not originating in the Secretariat comprise the bulk of the documents issued and requests the Secretary-General to examine ways and means to achieve compliance with the relevant guideline on page limits and to report to the Committee on Conferences on the matter; 6. Also notes the intention of the Secretary-General to conduct a comprehensive study of workload standards and performance measurement and to establish a Secretariat task force with broad participation; 7. Requests the Secretary-General to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis of the current approach to summary records and to review the list of bodies entitled to them, in consultation with the relevant intergovernmental bodies, with a view to assessing the relevance of such records and providing viable, efficient, effective and financially sound alternatives; 8. Recognizes that user satisfaction is a key performance indicator in conference management and services, and requests the Secretary-General to continue to take a user-oriented approach towards performance management on a wider scope and to incorporate the results of such an approach, as well as the results of its own internal evaluation of the Department, in the operation of the Department; 9. Requests the Secretary-General to provide assistance to Member States, as required, in the transition to electronic submission and retrieval of documents, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly; 10. Notes the pilot project on ways and means of completing the concordance of draft resolutions prior to their adoption by the General Assembly, and reiterates the need to maintain the concordance principle for all resolutions; III Documentation- and publication-related matters 1.

Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that documentation is available in accordance with the six-week rule for the distribution of documents simultaneously in the six official languages of the General Assembly; IV 1.
