I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly, under agenda items 64 and 81, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Ricardo G. CASTANEDA Ambassador Permanent Representative English Page ANNEX Joint declaration by the Governments of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic on the nuclear tests conducted by the Governments of India and Pakistan, issued on 28 May 1998 in New York The Governments of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic categorically reject the nuclear tests conducted by the Government of India on 11 and 13 May 1998 and the effects which the latter have had on the countries of South Asia, particularly the reaction of Pakistan, which decided to conduct five nuclear tests on today’s date. These tests have increased the concern of countries around the world because they run counter to the purposes and principles laid down in the Charter of the United Nations and to the efforts of the majority of the members of the international community, which aspire to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world, as expressed most significantly in the signature of the agreements on the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the signature of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; and because they represent an element of instability in that region, whose proliferation could have unpredictable consequences for international peace and security. The Governments of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic consider that, at this point in the development of the international system, and particularly in the post-cold-war era, there is no justification for building up the global nuclear arsenal, which in no way contributes to the maintenance of stability and security in that region, not even as a mechanism for national defence and security, and that collective efforts should be directed towards promoting the total elimination of that arsenal. Furthermore, steps should be taken to ensure that financial and technological resources for the achievement of sustainable development are not diverted from that purpose, and to strengthen cooperation so that the limited resources available may be used to improve the living conditions of peoples, and particularly to pursue the priority objective of combating poverty and extreme poverty. The Governments of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, in the framework of the ties of friendship and cooperation which they maintain with the Governments of India and Pakistan, urge the latter to rejoin the international community’s efforts to end nuclear testing and to advance the cause of nuclear disarmament, and to demonstrate their goodwill and solidarity with the aspirations of the peoples of the United Nations, in addition to complying with the international commitments and obligations laid down in the Charter, by putting a definitive stop to this type of testing and by adhering fully and unconditionally to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; and urge the rest of the countries of the region to refrain from taking measures which would increase tensions and jeopardize the progress achieved in this area. The Governments of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic support the statement made by the President of the Security Council on 14 May 1998, in which he deplored the nuclear tests conducted by the Government of India and reiterated the statement that the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constituted a threat to international peace and security. In view of the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan, they request the Security Council, in discharging its high responsibilities, to give priority to the issue of nuclear testing in South Asia and to consider the advisability of convening a formal meeting, which would be open to participation by all States Members of the United Nations, to examine the issue with a view to formulating such recommendations and adopting such measures as may be necessary to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in general, for the purpose of safeguarding international peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles laid down in the Charter.
