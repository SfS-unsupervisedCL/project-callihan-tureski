Letter dated 13 April 2004 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism addressed to the President of the Security Council On 12 January 2004, the Committee established pursuant to paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) (the Counter-Terrorism Committee) submitted a work programme for the tenth 90-day period (S/2004/32). Annexed hereto is the Committee's work programme for the eleventh 90-day period, which covers the months from April to June 2004 (see annex). The Committee will continue to work with States on monitoring the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001), continuing to operate on the principles of cooperation, transparency and equal treatment. The Committee's main objectives will continue to be maintaining and strengthening the consensus within the international community on the importance of combating terrorism, with particular emphasis on establishing practical measures designed to increase the capabilities of States to combat terrorism; helping to identify and address the problems faced by States in implementing resolution 1373 (2001); and encouraging international coordination and cooperation by, for instance, contributing to the process of increasing the number of States that are parties to the international conventions and protocols relating to counter-terrorism. All of these tasks contribute to the Committee's mandate, as set out in paragraph 6 of the resolution, to monitor its implementation. On the other hand, the eleventh work programme takes into account the fact that, during the three-month period, the Committee will go through a transitional period during which it will begin, in cooperation with the United Nations Secretariat, to implement the provisions of Security Council resolution 1535 (2004) and the recommendations contained in the Committee's report (S/2004/124) to enable the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate to become operational as soon as possible. In order to attain those general goals, the Committee will continue its work in the areas of technical assistance and cooperation with international organizations in accordance with the decisions adopted by the Committee. The Committee welcomes the support received from Member States, the United Nations Secretariat and international, regional and subregional organizations, and pays tribute to the contribution of its team of experts. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Inocencio F. Arias Chairman Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism Work programme of the Counter-Terrorism Committee (1 April-30 June 2004) 1. The present document sets out the work programme of the Counter-Terrorism Committee for its eleventh 90-day period, from 1 April to 30 June 2004. This work programme updates that submitted for the tenth 90-day period (S/2004/32). This work programme will have to be adapted according to the implementation of Security Council resolution 1535 (2004). Summary 2.

I. Implementation of resolution 1373 (2001) 3. The Committee and its subcommittees will continue to review the reports submitted by States pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 1373 (2001). 4. By 31 March 2004 the Committee had received 488 reports from States and others. They include first reports from 191 Member States and 5 from others, 159 second reports from Member States and 2 from others, 107 third reports from Member States and 24 fourth reports from Member States. As indicated earlier, all States have submitted their first reports. 5. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that 70 States have missed the deadlines for submission of their respective reports. The Committee urges all States that have not submitted their reports on time to submit them as soon as possible in fulfilment of the provisions of resolution 1373 (2001). The Committee remains ready to work with them to find a way to progress towards the common objective of combating terrorism in the terms established by resolution 1373 (2001). The Chairman of the Committee will continue to provide the Security Council with the list of States late in the submission of their reports. The list will be released to the Security Council at the time of the Chairman's report to the Security Council; it includes the States (if any) that have contacted the Committee and those that have asked for assistance. 6. In accordance with resolution 1456 (2003), the Committee will continue to report regularly on progress made by States regarding their obligation to report to the Security Council pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 1373 (2001). 7. Bearing in mind the call for all States to become parties as soon as possible to the relevant international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism contained in paragraph 3 (d) of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) and paragraph 2 (a) of the declaration annexed to Security Council resolution 1456 (2003), the Committee will remain committed to ensuring that the largest possible number of States become parties to the 12 pertinent international conventions and protocols and incorporate that important body of international law into their domestic legislation. II. Work of the Committee 8. On 19 February 2004 the Committee approved a report on its own revitalization (S/2004/124), and as proposed in paragraph 18 of that report resolution 1535 (2004) was adopted. 9. The Committee has also agreed that it should strengthen and integrate its efforts in the facilitation of technical assistance and reinforcing the coordination and cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations as stated in its reports (S/2004/70 and S/2004/124). During this work programme the Committee will undertake a thorough re-evaluation of its work in those areas, consistent with the report of the Chair of 14 November (S/2004/70) and the revitalization report (S/2004/124). In order that technical assistance becomes a priority in all areas of the Committee's work, and in preparation for the assumption of this function by the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, the Technical Assistance Team will be fully integrated with the larger group of experts, and additional experts in technical assistance will have to be recruited. 10. While pursuing a case-by-case approach in monitoring the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001), the Committee will bear in mind all international best practices, codes and standards that are relevant to the implementation of the resolution. III. Technical assistance 11. The facilitation of the provision of technical assistance to countries in need will remain one of the Committee's priorities. The report of the Chair of 14 November is clear about the need to study and develop the means necessary to ensure that technical assistance receives the appropriate attention from the Committee and the Security Council. In order for the Committee to play a more dynamic role in the area of technical assistance, its current approach in this area needs to be re-evaluated and improved. 12. The Committee has developed the Directory of Counter-Terrorism Information and Sources of Assistance, which can be consulted on its web site, at http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/committees/1373/ctc_da/index.html. The Directory is designed to be a source of information on counter-terrorism-related best practices, model laws and available assistance programmes. The Committee encourages all States seeking assistance or guidance in the matters covered by resolution 1373 (2001) to use this online information tool. 13. The Committee and its experts are ready, wherever possible, to facilitate the provision of assistance programmes to States in order to further the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001). IV. Transparency in the work of the Committee 14. Transparency will continue to be a hallmark of the work of the Committee. 15. The Committee will continue to provide information on its activities on a regular basis, including briefings of interested delegations by the Chairman. The next briefing will be held before the end of April. As a general rule, the Chair will brief interested delegations at least once a month. 16. The Committee has an informative web site (http://www.un.org/sc/ctc) that has become an essential source of information on all aspects of the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001). In follow-up to paragraph 15 of the ninth work programme (S/2003/995), and after several months of work, the web site is fully operational in all United Nations languages. 17. The Committee, through its Chairman, the Executive Director, once appointed, and, where appropriate, the Committee's experts will continue to maintain close relations with organizations and programmes of the United Nations system on aspects relevant to international counter-terrorism efforts, within the scope of the mandate contained in resolution 1373 (2001). 18. States are encouraged to make direct contact with the subcommittees or experts to seek any clarification on the issues covered in their correspondence with the Committee or on any other issue (tel.: 1-212-963-3520 or 1-212-457-1886; fax: 1-212-963-7878; e-mail: ctc@un.org). 19. The Committee has updated its web site as a source of detailed information on all issues related to resolution 1373 (2001). The Committee will create and maintain a matrix of technical assistance programmes by international, regional and subregional organizations. Pursuant to the Joint Declaration adopted in Vienna on 12 March 2004, after the third meeting of the Committee with those organizations, the Committee encourages all relevant organizations to contact it on a regular basis to ensure that the information provided in the new matrix is both accurate and useful for Member States seeking technical assistance. The Committee also encourages organizations to continue to submit information on international best practices, codes and standards relevant to the implementation of resolution 1373 (2001) and on any modes of assistance and guidance in implementing those best practices, codes and standards. V. Cooperation between the Committee and international, regional and subregional organizations 20. The Committee has continued to expand its contacts and cooperation with international, regional and subregional organizations as outlined in the action plan agreed following the special meeting of the Committee held on 6 March 2003. Further to paragraph 22 of the tenth work programme and to strengthen the Committee's cooperation with those organizations, the follow-up meeting between the Committee and international, regional and subregional organizations, co-hosted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, was held at Vienna on 11 and 12 March 2004. At the end of the meeting a Joint Declaration was issued by all participants, which will be sent to the Security Council for circulation as a document. 21. The Committee, through its Chairman, the Executive Director, once appointed, and, where appropriate, the Committee's experts will continue to establish contacts with organizations outside the United Nations system by attending regional meetings and conferences. VI. Future work of the Committee 22. The Committee, including through the Chair, will work closely with the Executive Director of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, once appointed, in order to contribute to his/her success in the implementation of the provisions of resolution 1535 (2004) and the recommendations in the Committee's report (S/2004/124).
