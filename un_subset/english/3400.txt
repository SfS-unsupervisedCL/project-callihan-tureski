Mr. Abdellatif (Egypt), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.41 which he was submitting on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.28, and stated that it was a consensus text. 2. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.41 was adopted. 3. Mr. Ravou Akii (Vanuatu) thanked the Group of 77 and the original sponsors of the draft resolution (which dealt inter alia with Vanuatu’s status as a least developed country) and the members of the Secretariat and of the Committee who had made it possible to reach consensus. 4. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.28 was withdrawn. Recommendations contained in the report of the Economic and Social Council Revision of the General Regulations of the World Food Programme 5. The Chairman recalled that, in its decision 1997/217 entitled “Revision of the General Regulations of the World Food Programme”, the Economic and Social Council had recommended that the General Assembly should endorse the revisions of the General Regulations of the World Food Programme as contained in the annex to the report of the Executive Board of the World Food Programme (E/1997/49). He took it that the Committee wished to endorse those revisions accordingly. 6. It was so decided. Report of the United Nations University 7. The Chairman drew attention to Economic and Social Council decision 1997/43 entitled “Report of the United Nations University” whereby the Council recommended that the General Assembly should decide that, beginning in 1998, the report of the United Nations University would be considered directly by the Second Committee of the General Assembly in accordance with its programme of work. He took it that the Committee wished to decide accordingly. 8. It was so decided. Report of the Committee for Development Planning 9. The Chairman recalled that in its decision 1997/223 entitled “Report of the Committee for Development Planning” whereby the Economic and Social Council had endorsed the recommendations contained in paragraphs 240 (a) and (b) of the report of the Committee on the work of its thirty-first session, regarding the list of least developed countries and had decided to submit them to the General Assembly for appropriate action. In view of the decision just taken regarding the status of Vanuatu (A/C.2/52/L.41), he took it that the Committee wished to endorse only the recommendation contained in paragraph 240 (b), namely, that Cape Verde, Maldives and Samoa be graduated from the list at the time of the next review, in 2000. 10. It was so decided. Draft decision concerning several reports before the Committee 11. The Chairman proposed that the Committee adopt a draft decision the text of which would read: “The General Assembly takes note of the following documents: Relevant chapters of the report of the Economic and Social Council for 1977, chapters I-IV; chapter V, sections A, B, C, F, G, H, I and J; chapter VII; and annexes (A/52/3); Report of the Secretary-General on the possibilities of strengthening the coordination of the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system in the field of energy (A/52/175-E/1997/75); Report of the Secretary-General on new and innovative funds for globally agreed commitments and priorities (A/52/203-E/1997/85); Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund on the United Nations Population Award (A/52/212); and Note by the Secretary-General transmitting the statement by the Administrative Committee on Coordination on universal access to basic communications and information services (A/52/354).” 12. The draft decision was adopted. 13. The Chairman said that the Committee had thus concluded its consideration of agenda item 12. (b) Trade and development (continued) (A/C.2/52/L.23/Rev.1) Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.23/Rev.1: Unilateral economic measures used as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries 14. Mr. Abdellatif (Egypt), Vice-Chairman, said that draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.23 had been submitted at the start of the Committee’s work and that the informal consultations on that text had resulted in draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.23/Rev.1 which was going to be put to the vote. 15. Mr. Winnick (United States of America), speaking in explanation of vote before the vote, said that his delegation opposed the draft resolution because his country regarded economic sanctions as a legitimate instrument of foreign policy, to press for a change in unacceptable international behaviour. His country believed that sanctions were most effective when applied multilaterally, and it therefore tried wherever possible to devise a collective response. However, there were times when it had no choice but to act unilaterally, in which case it was mindful of humanitarian concerns and of the need to avoid harm to the innocent. Furthermore, each State had the right to decide with which other States it would engage in commerce. If a State decided to limit its economic relations with any other State, such action was not a coercive measure: it was the exercise of a sovereign right. The draft resolution was based on a double standard because it implied that it was acceptable for some States to exercise certain rights but not for others; his delegation would therefore vote against the draft. 16. A recorded vote was taken on draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.23/Rev.1. In favour: Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Saint Lucia, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Togo, United Arab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe. Against: United States of America. Abstaining: Andorra, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, San Marino, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 17. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.23/Rev.1 was adopted by 86 votes to 1, with 45 abstentions. 18. Mr. Meyer (Luxembourg), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that the members of the Union had abstained in the vote on the draft resolution just adopted; while acknowledging that improvements had been made in the text of the resolution adopted two years earlier, they wished to make a number of points. Economic measures must be in keeping with the principles of international law, as laid down in the United Nations Charter, and with the broadest interpretation of the principles of the multilateral trading system set up by the World Trade Organization. Unilateral coercive economic measures that violated international law must not be taken against any member of the international community; such measures were not acceptable. It was regrettable that the draft resolution focused almost entirely on the adoption of such measures against developing countries; it was to be hoped that if a new text was submitted at the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly the debate under the corresponding item would lead to inclusion of those points. 19. Mr. Kisiri (United Republic of Tanzania), speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, thanked the delegations that had voted in favour of the draft resolution or abstained in the vote. The intensive consultations on the draft had clearly influenced the voting, since the number of votes against the draft was much lower than in preceding years. That change represented an important message from the international community warning against unilateral economic measures as a means of exerting economic and political pressure, which had become more frequent in recent years. The Group of 77 and China had displayed flexibility on that tricky issue and hoped that the text would attract increasing support in coming years. 20. Mr. Chomar (Mozambique) said that his delegation had been absent during the recorded vote; had it been present, it would have voted in favour of the draft resolution. 21. Mr. Draunimasi (Fiji) said that although the board indicated otherwise his delegation had intended to vote in favour of the draft resolution, and not to abstain. 22. Mr. Runge (Germany) said that, had his delegation been present during the vote on draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.23/Rev.1, it would have abstained, as the other members of the European Union had; Mr. Kamilos (Greece) said that the same applied to his delegation. 23. Mr. Azaiez (Tunisia) said that his delegation, which had also been absent during the vote, supported the draft resolution just adopted. Mr. Habiyaremye (Rwanda) said that his delegation, which had been unable to take part in the vote on the draft resolution, had wanted to vote in favour of it. Mr. Biaou (Benin) said that, had his delegation been present during the vote, it would have joined the delegations of developing countries that had voted in favour of the draft resolution. (d) International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (continued) (A/C.2/52/L.20 and L.37) Draft resolutions A/C.2/52/L.20 and L.37: International cooperation to reduce the impact of the El Niño phenomenon 24. Mr. Glanzer (Austria), Vice-Chairman, said that the consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.20 had been productive and a consensus had thus been reached on draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.37. He therefore invited the Committee to adopt the latter draft by consensus. 25. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.37 was adopted. 26. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.20 was withdrawn. Draft decision on reports of the Secretary-General 27. The Chairman invited the Committee to consider the following draft decision under agenda item 98 (d): “The General Assembly takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (A/52/560) and the report of the Secretary-General on the improved effectiveness of early-warning systems with regard to natural and similar disasters (A/52/561)”. 28. The draft decision was adopted. 29. The Chairman said that the Committee had thus completed consideration of agenda item 98 (d). Agenda item 98: Environment and sustainable development (continued) (A/C.2/52/L.19 and L.42) Draft resolutions A/C.2/52/L.19 and L.42: Implementation of the global conference on sustainable development of small island developing States 30. Mr. Glanzer (Austria), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.42, which had been submitted on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.19, and recommended its adoption by consensus. 31. Mr. Chouinard (Canada) said that his delegation had indicated during the informal consultations that it wished to be a sponsor of the draft resolution. 32. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.42 was adopted. 33. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.19 was withdrawn. 34. The Chairman said that the Committee had thus concluded its consideration of agenda item 98 (f). Agenda item 99: Operational activities for development (continued) (A/C.2/52/L.5, L.46, L.9 and L.44) Draft resolutions A/C.2/52/L.5 and L.46: Operational activities for development of the United Nations system 35. Mr. Abdellatif (Egypt), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.46, which had been submitted on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.5. He recommended the adoption of that text, which was the outcome of a consensus; it would serve as a sound basis for preparing the triennial policy review to be conducted in 1998. 36. Mr. Langley (New Zealand) said that, during the informal consultations on that draft resolution, his delegation had proposed the insertion of a paragraph which read as follows: “recognizes the growing importance of private sector funding for operational activities for development”. However, no consensus had been reached on that proposal. Following fresh negotiations, the Committee had appeared to be no closer to reaching agreement on whether to note the role played by non-governmental sources of funding. In that regard, two interesting facts were worth pointing out: firstly, in 1996, a third of the core budget of UNICEF had come from non-governmental sources; secondly, in the near future, a private institution, the Turner Foundation, would contribute $100 million a year to United Nations operational activities. His delegation was therefore extremely disappointed that the General Assembly was not ready to recognize the fact that private sector funding already played a role in operational activities, and that such role would continue to grow in the future. That notwithstanding, his delegation would not undermine the consensus achieved on that resolution. However, the role played by private sector funds was a fundamental issue which should be considered in 1998 during the triennial policy review. 37. Mr. Kamando (United Republic of Tanzania), responding to the statement of the representative of New Zealand, who had proposed the insertion of a paragraph on private sector financing, said that the Group of 77 did not consider it appropriate to mention such sources in the draft resolution under consideration. Indeed, that issue should rather be considered by the UNDP/UNFPA Executive Board, and as part of the preparatory process of the 1998 triennial policy review. His delegation, supported by other delegations, believed that it was not necessary to stress resources other than core resources. 38. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.46 was adopted. 39. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.5 was withdrawn. 40. The Chairman said that the Committee had thus concluded its consideration of agenda item 99 (a). Draft resolutions A/C.2/52/L.9 and L.44: Economic and technical cooperation among developing countries 41. Mr. Abdellatif (Egypt), Vice-Chairman, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.44, which had been submitted on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.9. There had been an omission in the sixth line of paragraph 4; the words “of San José” should therefore be inserted after “Declaration and Plan of Action”. 42. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.44, as orally revised, was adopted. 43. Draft resolution A/C.2/52/L.9 was withdrawn. 44. The Chairman said that the Committee had thus concluded its consideration of agenda item 99 (b). Draft decision on various reports and notes of the Secretary-General (A/52/39, A/51/655-E/1996/105, A/52/114-E/1997/46, A/51/636-E/1996/104, A/52/115-E/1997/47, A/52/457, A/52/457/Add.1) 45. The Chairman invited the Committee to consider the following draft decision under agenda item 99: “The General Assembly takes note of the following documents: Report of the High-level Committee on the review of technical cooperation among developing countries (A/52/39); Report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Review of financial resources allocated by the United Nations system to activities of non-governmental organizations” (A/51/655-E/1996/105) and a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the comments of the Administrative Committee on Coordination thereon (A/52/114-E/1997/46); Report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Coordination of policy and programming frameworks for more effective development cooperation” (A/51/636-E/1996/104) and a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the comments of the Administrative Committee on Coordination thereon (A/52/115-E/1997/47); Report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Strengthening field representation of the United Nations system” (A/52/457) and a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the comments of the Administrative Committee on Coordination thereon (A/52/457/Add.1)”. 46. The draft decision was adopted. 47. The Chairman said that the Committee had thus concluded its consideration of agenda item 99. The meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.
