UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/931 1 September 1999 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: ARABIC IDENTICAL LETTERS DATED 31 AUGUST 1999 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL AND TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to inform you of the following: 1. On 6 July 1999 a group of Iraqi fishermen were the victims of acts of piracy carried out in the Iraqi territorial waters between the ports of Mina' al-Bakr and Khawr al-Amiyah by Kuwaiti coastal patrols. The fishermen were blindfolded and had their hands tied, and were taken, with their boats, to the Kuwaiti interior. There they were subjected to physical torture, interrogated and photographed. 2. Two days later, they were moved to a different building, where they were fingerprinted and kept in solitary confinement until 19 July 1999. 3. Their boats remained impounded when the men were released: they were taken to a place in the Umm Qasr area, close to the Iraqi borders. I should be grateful if you would intervene with Kuwait with a view to halting such provocative practices and acts of aggression carried out by Kuwaiti patrols. There has been a recent, unjustified increase in these incidents, which are in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of international law, and also constitute a threat to the sovereignty and security of the Republic of Iraq. The Republic of Iraq reaffirms its right, in accordance with the principle of international responsibility, to demand legal reparation for the losses sustained by Iraq and its people through these acts of aggression. I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Saeed H. HASAN Ambassador Permanent Representative
