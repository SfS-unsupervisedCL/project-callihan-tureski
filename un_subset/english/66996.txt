Introduction 1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the reports of the Secretary-General on estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council (A/68/327 and Add.1-6). During its consideration of the reports, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification, concluding with written responses on 10 December 2013. 2. The Advisory Committee notes that, of the total of 36 special political missions emanating from decisions of the General Assembly and/or the Security Council, the Secretary-General has presented estimated requirements of $540,762,100 net for 34 such missions for 2014 (A/68/327/Add.1-6). In addition, the Secretary-General indicates that the proposed budgets for 2014 for two missions (the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia and the Joint Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations for the Elimination of the Chemical Weapons Programme of the Syrian Arab Republic) will be submitted in separate addenda (A/68/327/Add.7 and 8) when the requirements of the Missions have been determined (A/68/327, paras. 1 and 4). The resource requirements for the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Myanmar, whose mandate emanates from the General Assembly, will be presented in a statement of programme budget implications in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly, subject to action taken in the Third Committee of the Assembly. Those requirements are also included in the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327 and Add.1) so as to consolidate the overall resource requirements for all special political missions. 3. The Advisory Committee notes that the budget proposals of the Secretary-General for 34 of the 36 special political missions for 2014 are, as in the past, grouped into three thematic clusters (A/68/327/Add.1-3), while the resource requirements of the two largest missions (UNAMA and UNAMI) are presented separately (A/68/327/Add.4 and 5). Further, the requirements for 2014 for the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria, which is under cluster I, is presented in a separate document (A/68/327/Add.6) (see also sect. IV.A below). In the present report, the Committee highlights the resource requirements for the 34 special political missions for 2014-2015 requested in document A/68/327 and Add.1-6 (sect. II), makes general observations and recommendations regarding the administration and management of the resources and areas for improvement (sect. III) and makes recommendations related to the resources proposed for specific missions (sect. IV). The reports of the Committee on the budgets for 2014 for the remaining two missions (UNSOM and the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission will be issued separately). Status of the mandates of the missions created and discontinued in 2013 4. The Secretary-General provides information with respect to the status of the mandates of the 34 missions for which budgetary requirements are requested for 2014 in his report (A/68/327 and Add.1-6), as follows: (a) 12 missions have open-ended mandates; (b) 18 missions have mandates expiring in 2014 or later; (c) 3 missions have mandates expiring in 2013; and (d) 1 mission is under consideration by the General Assembly (A/68/327, paras. 6-8). He indicates that the 2014 budget proposals for the missions whose mandates expire during the course of 2013 are included in his report on the assumption that the General Assembly or the Security Council will extend their mandates into 2014 on the basis of reports and requests already submitted or to be submitted to them. 5. The missions that were created in late 2012 and 2013 are as follows (A/68/327, paras. 9-13): (a) The United Nations Office in Mali was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 2085 (2012). Its mandate was subsumed by MINUSMA, which was established by the Council in its resolution 2100 (2013) as a peacekeeping mission; (b) The Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel was created in October 2012 and funded to the end of that year from extrabudgetary resources. The General Assembly, in its resolution 67/269, approved the budget for the Office of the Special Envoy for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2013; (c) The Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region was created in March 2013, and its requirements are being funded under the commitment authority granted to the Secretary-General in General Assembly resolution 66/249 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses; (d) The Security Council established UNSOM by its resolution 2102 (2013) and discontinued UNPOS by its resolution 2093 (2013); (e) The OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission was established in accordance with Security Council resolution 2118 (2013). II. Overview of resource requirements for 2014-2015 6. The Advisory Committee requested information on the total number of missions, their overall expenditure and levels of civilian personnel for the bienniums 2008-2009 to 2012-2013, as compared with the proposals for 2014-2015 (see table 1 below). The Committee further notes that for 2014, the proposed resources amount to $540.8 million for 2014 for 34 missions as presented by the Secretary-General in his main report for special political missions (A/68/327 and Add. 1-6), while, as indicated in footnote i to the table, the proposed overall resources amount to $603 million for 2014 for a total of 36 missions, including the two missions presented in documents A/68/327/Add.7 and 8. (Millions of United States dollars) Actual Proposed Number of ongoing missionsa 35b 34c TBD Approved civilian personneld 4 080e 3 845f Approved budgetsg 627.8h 576.6h 540.8i Expenditurej 627.2k 584.3l Abbreviations: TBD, to be determined. a The numbers of ongoing missions reflect the total number of missions for which resources were reflected in the main report of the subsequent year, including missions funded through commitment authority during that year. b The number of ongoing missions for 2013 is 38, taking into account UNSOM, the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission and UNOM, which are funded through commitment authority. c The number of missions for 2014 reflects the 34 missions for which resources are sought in the context of document A/68/327. The total number of missions is 36, taking into account UNSOM (A/68/327/Add.7) and the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission (A/68/327/Add.8). d The numbers of approved civilian personnel as reflected in the main reports of the subsequent budget years. e The number of approved civilian personnel would be 4,179, taking into account the approved staffing for 2013 for UNPOS (99 positions), as the staffing of UNPOS is not reflected in A/68/327. f The number of proposed civilian personnel for 2014 reflects positions for the 34 missions reflected in A/68/327. Taking into account the staffing for UNSOM (221 positions) and the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission (123 positions), the total number of proposed civilian personnel for 2014 for 36 missions is 4,189 positions. g The approved budgets as reflected in the final budget appropriations on a biennial basis. h The approved budgets for 2012 and 2013 reflect the total biennial revised appropriation as reflected in A/68/327. The approved budgets do not include resource requirements for UNSOM, the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission and UNOM for which resources were provided through commitment authority. The appropriation for the subvention for the Special Court for Sierra Leone has also been excluded. i The proposed budget for 34 missions for 2014 as reflected in A/68/327. Taking into account requirements for UNSOM ($50,394,800) and the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission ($11,822,900), the total proposed budget is $603.0 million for 36 missions. j Expenditure as reflected in section 3 of the programme budget in the subsequent biennium. k Expenditure for 2011 excludes the subvention for the Special Court for Sierra Leone. l Projected expenditure for 2013 is $602.9, taking into account projected expenditure for UNSOM, the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission and UNOM. 7. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was also provided with information on expenditure for 2012, approved resources and projected expenditures for 2013 and proposed resources for 2014 for each of the 34 special political missions, as well as budgets and expenditures for the past five years since the biennium 2008-2009. The Committee requests that the information it has received be provided to the General Assembly at the time of its consideration of the proposed budgets for 2014 for the special political missions. Having reviewed the budget proposals for the special political missions for 2014, the Advisory Committee is of the view that the overall budgeting has improved, showing more accuracy when compared with past and current expenditure trends. Provision for the biennium 2014-2015 8. The Advisory Committee recalls that a biennial provision of $1,081 million for special political missions was included in section 3, Political affairs, of the proposed programme budget for 2014-2015, which reflects a reduction of $32 million to the amount of $1,113 million as proposed for special political missions by the Secretary-General in the budget outline for 2014-2015 (see A/68/7, paras. II.2 and II.22-II.27). According to the Secretary-General, the reduction of $32 million was in response to General Assembly resolution 67/248 (see paras. 14 and 15 below). 9. The Advisory Committee further recalls that, according to the Secretary-General, the proposed budget outline for 2014-2015 did not take into account requirements for three missions: the Offices of the Special Envoys of the Secretary-General for the Sahel and for the Great Lakes Region (both came into being after the preparation of the report of the Secretary-General on the budget outline) and the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria (which was not expected to continue as a special political mission at the time of the finalization of the budget outline) (see A/68/7, para. II.23). The classification by the Secretary-General of the 36 special political missions as continuing or new, in the context of the biennial provision of $1,081 million for 2014-2015, is contained in annex V to his report (A/68/327) and summarized below (ibid., paras. 79-82): (a) Of the proposed resources of $540.8 million for 34 of the 36 missions, the proposed resources of $520 million for 2014 for 31 missions are considered within the estimated biennial provision of $1,081 million included in the proposed programme budget for 2014-2015 and the proposed resources of $20.5 million for three missions -- the Offices of the Special Envoys of the Secretary-General for the Sahel and for the Great Lakes Region and the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria are considered new and additional to the estimated biennial provision (see para. 5 above); (b) Resources for two new missions -- the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia and the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission -- are to be submitted in separate addenda (see para. 2 above). 10. As indicated in paragraph 3.82 of the proposed programme budget for 2014-2015 (A/68/6 (sect. 3)), any additional requirements above the biennial provision of $1,081 million would continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of annex I, paragraph 11, of General Assembly resolution 41/213. The Advisory Committee notes that, while a biennial provision for special political missions is included and approved in the regular budget, budgets for individual missions are submitted and approved on an annual basis. Given that 2014 is the first year of the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015, the overall resource requirements for special political missions (continuing or new) within and above the biennial provision of $1,081 million can only be determined in the second year of the programme budget (see recommendations for 2014 in sect. V below and A/68/327, annex I). 11. The Advisory Committee also recalls that the biennial provision of $1,081 million for special political missions accounts for 20 per cent of the overall resources in the proposed programme budget for 2014-2015 (see A/68/7, table II.4). Upon request, the Committee was provided with information on the percentage of resources for the special political missions in the regular budgets in the past five bienniums (see table 2 below). Table 2 Resources for special political missions as a percentage of the total programme budget Biennium Programme budget excluding special political missions Total programme budget Special political missions as a percentage of the total programme (a) (b) (c)=(a)+(b) (d)=(a)/(c) 2004-2005 (final appropriation)a 2006-2007 (final appropriation) 2008-2009 (final appropriation) 2010-2011 (final appropriation)a 2012-2013 (revised appropriation)a 4 195.0b 2014-2015 (proposed budget, before recosting)c 4 323.3d a The appropriation for the subvention of the Special Court for Sierra Leone is included under the regular budget, excluding special political missions (column (b)). b The figure reflects the deferral of post-related recosting for payroll, common staff costs and vacancy rates for 2012 and deferral of overall post-related recosting for 2013. c Figures for 2014-2015 reflect the proposed level of the provision for special political missions 2014-2015 as contained in A/68/6 (sect. 3); see also paras. 8 and 9 above, which provide information on the total of 36 missions for 2014. d The proposed budget, before recosting for 2014-2015, reflects resources at revised 2012-2013 rates (see A/68/6 (Introduction), para. 3 (e)). Proposed resources for 2014 12. The proposed requirements for 2014 for 34 of the 36 special political missions amount to $540,762,100 net (A/68/327, sect. II; see also para. 2 above), representing a reduction of $12,757,300, compared with the approved resources of $553,519,400 for 2013. The percentage of the allocation of the overall resources for 2014 is as follows: cluster I, 6.8 per cent; cluster II, 6 per cent; cluster III, 26.1 per cent; UNAMA, 35.4 per cent; and UNAMI, 25.7 per cent (A/68/327, figure I). Tables 4 and 5 of the report of the Secretary-General provide information with respect to the resource requirements for 2014 by mission and by major category of expenditure. A summary of the resource requirements for 2014 by major category of expenditure is provided in table 3 below. Table 3 Summary of estimated requirements by major category of expenditurea (Thousands of United States dollars) 1 January 2012-31 December 2013 Requirements for 1 January-31 December 2014 Variance analysis Appropriation Estimated expenditures Variance Total requirements Non-recurrent requirements Total requirements 2013 Military and police personnel Civilian personnel Operational costs Total (net requirements) a Excludes: (a) UNSOM and the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission, for which requirements are to be submitted in separate addenda; and (b) UNPOS and the United Nations Office in Mali, which were discontinued during 2013. 13. As shown in table 3 above, the reduction of $12.8 million in the proposed resources for 2014 reflects: (a) reduced resources under operational costs ($19.7 million) and military and police personnel ($1.6 million), and (b) a proposed increase for civilian personnel ($8.5 million) (see para. 20 below). Explanations for the variances are provided in paragraphs 97 to 106 and table 5 of the report of the Secretary-General. The Secretary-General indicates that operational costs across special political missions have decreased from $303.2 million in 2012 to $239.3 million in 2013, and to $219.6 million in 2014 (A/68/327, para. 28). Impact of General Assembly resolution 67/248 14. The Secretary-General indicates that 12 tables (identical to those contained in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015) are included for the special political missions (3 for cluster I and 9 for cluster II) that experience an impact directly related to General Assembly resolution 67/248. Further, no impact directly related to the resolution is foreseen for missions under cluster III, UNAMA or UNAMI (ibid., paras. 20-22). According to the Secretary-General, none of the impact entails changes to the volume of outputs or the performance targets of the missions concerned. The primary areas of resource changes for those special political missions are reduced provisions for consultants and for the travel of staff and experts. The impact of such reductions is mitigated by an increased use of videoconferencing. 15. The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General has presented the impact of the reductions related to General Assembly resolution 67/248 for special political missions in the same manner as it is presented in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015. The Committee recalls its comments on the presentation of the reductions and the related impact on forecast performance measures in the proposed programme budget for 2014-2015. The Committee reiterates its recommendation that the Secretary-General be requested to return to the established practice reflected in previous budget presentations (see A/68/7, paras. 72-74). Travel 16. Annex VIII to the report of the Secretary-General provides information on the requirements for 2013 and 2014 for experts, consultants and official travel by mission. As reflected in the annex, overall reductions have been proposed for experts ($656,300, or 4 per cent), consultants ($1,009,200, or 15 per cent) and official travel ($2,485,300, or 14 per cent) (A/68/327, paras. 103-105). In the case of travel of experts under cluster II, the change in their standard of accommodation for air travel is due to their status as consultants (see sect. IV.B below). The Advisory Committee notes from the report that the reduced requirements under travel for experts and official travel are attributable both to reduced requirements for travel and to the change in the standards of accommodation for air travel for experts on consultancy contracts, as a result of General Assembly resolution 67/254 (ibid., paras. 103 and 105). The Committee requested, but did not receive, a breakdown of travel costs showing the reductions as a result of the decrease in the number of trips, and the reductions and/or savings related to General Assembly resolutions 65/268, 67/248 and 67/254. 17. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that, as noted in paragraph 105 of the report (A/68/327), an overall reduction of $2.5 million (14 per cent) is proposed for official travel for 2014, reflecting the net effect of reduced requirements for 25 special political missions and increased requirements for 2 missions. The Committee was informed that, for the purpose of implementing section VI, paragraph 14, of General Assembly resolution 67/254 A, the Secretariat promulgated on 12 August 2013 administrative instruction ST/AI/2013/3 on official travel of staff members and other authorized United Nations travellers. It should be noted that a number of other factors, such as, operational requirements, actual expenditure patterns and use of videoconferencing or teleconferencing also have an impact on requirements for travel. The Committee was further informed that, given the number of factors determining the resources budgeted for travel and the fact that there was no central system to track requirements at the level of detail requested by the Committee, it was not possible to disaggregate the impact of each of the factors that contributed to the reduced provisions for official travel in 2014. The Committee regrets that the Secretary-General is unable to provide the information requested by the Committee for a proper analysis of the resource requirements on travel for 2014. The Committee is of the view that the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions related to travel is likely to result in savings for some missions, while the recommendation of the Committee on the standard of travel for experts under cluster II, if approved by the Assembly, may have an impact on the proposed resources for experts for 2014 (see paras. 98-100 below). The Committee recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to report variances in all travel-related expenditures in the performance reports for the biennium 2014-2015. Staffing requirements for 2014 18. The overall proposed staffing for 2014 for 34 of the 36 missions, by category and level, is provided in table 6 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327). A total of 3,845 staff are proposed for 2014 for the 34 missions, compared with 4,080 staff approved for 2013. The two largest missions, UNAMA (with 1,691 staff, or 44 per cent) and UNAMI (with 956 staff, or 24.9 per cent), continue to account for a majority of positions for special political missions (ibid., table 6 and figure IV; see also paras. 29 and 30 below). 19. A summary of the staffing changes proposed for 2014 for each of the 34 missions is contained in annex VI to the report of the Secretary-General. The staffing changes proposed for 2014 reflect a net reduction of 235 positions for 34 of the 36 missions, with the largest number of positions proposed for reduction in UNAMA (241), as well as reductions due to the closure and liquidation in 2014 of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (A/68/327, para. 93). The reductions are partially offset by the proposed establishment of 26 positions in the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region (see sect. IV.A below). The Advisory Committee notes that, as the Secretary-General is to submit, in separate addenda, staffing requirements for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia and the OPCW-United Nations Joint Mission (see para. 2 above), the net reduction in positions for 2014 for the special political missions in 2014 has yet to be determined. 20. The share of civilian personnel costs in the overall resources is set to increase from 53.9 per cent in 2013 to 56.8 per cent in 2014 (A/68/327, para. 96). The Advisory Committee notes that, while a net reduction of 235 positions for the 34 missions is proposed, an increase of $8.5 million under civilian personnel is projected. The justifications provided by the Secretary-General in paragraph 98 of his report include: (a) the increase in resources for national positions in UNAMA, owing mainly to the combined effect of the increase in salary scales, the application of reduced vacancy rates, the increase in common staff costs and the increase in danger pay allowance rates, which are partly offset by the proposed reduction under national positions; (b) the increase in the provision for civilian personnel costs in UNAMI, owing mainly to the application of lower vacancy rates for national staff (Local level) positions and the increase in the rate of danger pay allowance for national staff; and (c) increases under two missions in cluster I, namely, the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region (a total of 26 positions), and the Office of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Yemen (3 new positions). 21. The Advisory Committee notes the increase in common staff costs for national staff in the proposed budget for 2014 for UNAMA, which reflects the calculation of common staff costs at 35 per cent of the net salaries for 2014 as compared to 25 per cent until 2013. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that 25 per cent had consistently proven insufficient as compared to the actual common staff costs incurred. The Committee requested, but did not receive, information on common staff costs for all missions. The Committee requests that the information on common staff costs, including variances, be provided in the budget proposals for special political missions for 2015. 22. Annex VII to the report of the Secretary-General contains information on the budgeted vacancy rates for 2013, actual vacancy rates as at 31 August 2013 and proposed vacancy rates for 2014 for special political missions under cluster III, UNAMA and UNAMI. The Secretary-General indicates that the proposed budget vacancy rates for 2014 take into account the actual vacancy rates experienced during 2013 and the planned deployments (ibid., para. 94). The comments and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on vacancy rates for individual missions are contained under the missions concerned in section IV below. 23. The Advisory Committee is of the view that, in his future budget proposals, the Secretary-General should provide information on vacancies, if any, that have existed in the special political missions for two years or longer. The Committee has expressed the view that, as a matter of overall policy, the continuing requirement for posts that have been vacant for two years or longer should be reviewed and justifications provided for their retention in the proposed programme budget. Otherwise, they should be proposed for abolishment (A/68/7, para. 107). The Committee believes that this policy should also be applied to staffing requirements for special political missions. 24. Two positions for the Department of Political Affairs are proposed for 2014 to provide support to the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region (for details, see sect. IV.A below). Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with table 4 below, showing the proposed number and levels of positions located at Headquarters in the proposed budgets for 2014 for backstopping special political missions. Of the total of 18 positions listed in the table, 16 positions have been approved in the 2013 budgets for the special political missions. The Advisory Committee recalls that an assessment had been made of the capacity utilized to support special political missions in terms of "full-time equivalents", which was defined as the amount of staff time equal to one full-time staff member for one year. Across all departments and offices, this had been found to amount to some 232 full-time equivalents. The Committee was informed, however, that the analysis was not conclusive, as there had been no determination of whether this time was over and above a full working day, and, as such, did not provide a basis for concluding how many posts were devoted to the backstopping of special political missions (A/66/7/Add.21, para. 66). Table 4 Positions located at Headquarters funded from budgets for special political missions Mission Department/Office P-5 P-4 P-3 GS (OL) UNAMI DPA/Middle East and West Asia Division DPA/Electoral Assistance Division DSS UNSMIL DPA/Africa II Division UNAMA Office of the Special Envoy for Sahel Office of the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region DPA/Africa I Division Office of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General for Cyprus DPA/Europe Division Office of the Joint Special Representative for Syria Abbreviations: DPA, Department of Political Affairs; DSS, Department of Safety and Security; GS (OL), General Service (Other level). 25. With respect to the backstopping of special political missions from Headquarters, the Advisory Committee notes that the staff at the Department of Political Affairs, whose positions are funded from the budgets of the special political missions, do not report directly to the heads of the field missions they support, but rather to the Department itself. Furthermore, the Committee recalls its observation on the resource level of the peacekeeping support account and the lack of a measurable relationship to the number, size and complexity of the peacekeeping operations (A/67/848, paras. 10 and 11). In this connection, the Committee is of the view that there should also be a relationship between the level of backstopping capacity provided at Headquarters and the overall scale of activities of the missions, which must reflect the totality of resources available. III. General observations and recommendations Format and presentation 26. The Advisory Committee notes that there has been a certain degree of improvement in the presentation and content of the budget estimates for 2014, such as the inclusion of annexes IV to VIII, providing information on, inter alia, staffing changes and vacancy rates, as well as the expansion of the subsection on the operational environment in section I.F of the main report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327). The Secretary-General indicates that, in line with the comments and suggestions of the Committee, efforts continue to be made to adapt and follow, as closely as is practical, the format and presentation of budgets for peacekeeping operations (ibid., para. 15). In this connection, the Committee notes the efforts made by the Secretary-General to improve the presentation and content of his budget proposals, as requested by the Committee. The Committee is, nonetheless, of the view that the Secretary-General should further improve the presentation and content, as well as the consistency of information of his budget proposals for special political missions by presenting comprehensive information related to cross-cutting issues in a format similar to that of the overview report on the financing of peacekeeping operations, with more detailed supplementary financial information to be provided to the Committee including the budgets for UNAMA and UNAMI, in order to facilitate the consideration of the issues and decision-making by the General Assembly (A/67/604, para. 25). 27. With respect to the results-based-budgeting frameworks, the Advisory Committee was informed that, for thematic cluster II, a holistic review of the concerned section of the budget document was undertaken in order to harmonize, to the extent possible, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and outputs, with a view to applying a common approach by which the monitoring entities are supported, as well as consistency in measuring and managing their performance. The Committee welcomes the efforts made to improve the presentation of the results-based-budgeting frameworks in cluster II. The Committee notes, however, that a number of expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement for some missions still lack clarity and accuracy regarding what could or should be achieved by the concerned missions in relation to the mandates and related activities. For example, indicators of achievement and performance measures could be more precise and measurable for the Office of the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region and the Joint Special Representative for Syria under cluster I, and UNIOGBIS and UNSCOL under cluster III. The Committee reiterates its view that certain expected accomplishments and related indicators of achievement can be improved in order to better reflect what could realistically be achieved by the respective missions and the activities for which the mission could be held accountable (A/67/780, para. 5). The Committee further expresses its view that, from the viewpoint of its role in the budgetary review process, the logical frameworks require improvement if they are to enable Member States to assess how effectively mandates are being implemented and also meet the specific needs of the Secretariat to use such frameworks as planning and monitoring tools (A/67/604, para. 26). 28. The Advisory Committee has commented on the consistency in the organizational nomenclature used by the Secretariat in its consideration of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 (A/68/7, paras. 138-140). In its review of the proposed budgets for the special political missions for 2014, the Committee notes a number of inconsistencies in the application of the guidance for the organizational nomenclature, such as the nomenclature used by UNAMA. The Committee was informed that UNAMA would issue the relevant guidance to managers for a revision and update. The Committee reiterates that the existing guidance should be applied consistently across all missions, with clear explanations provided for any variations from it. Staffing trends 29. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with information (see table 5), showing the levels and types of contracts for the heads of all the special political missions. Upon enquiry, the Committee was also informed that the following three missions have heads at the Under-Secretary-General level, on when- actually-employed contracts, supported by special advisers/envoys at the Assistant Secretary-General-level (Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel and Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes region). Table 5 Level and type of contract for heads of all special political missions Special political mission Level Contract type Cluster I Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Myanmar USG Full-time WAE Special Adviser of the Secretary-General for the Prevention of Genocide Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara $1/year ASG Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria Special Envoy for the Sudan and South Sudan Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Yemen Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes region Cluster II For all sanctions monitoring teams, groups and panels, and the Support to the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004)a Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate Cluster III UNOWAb BINUCA UNIOGBIS UNIPSIL CNMCb UNRCCA BNUB UNSCOL UNOCA Abbreviations: USG, Under-Secretary-General; ASG, Assistant Secretary-General; WAE, when-actually-employed. a For Cluster II special political missions, excluding the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate, sanctions monitoring teams, groups and panels are lead by a Coordinator, selected from the members of each group. All the members are contracted on a consultancy contract. b The Head of UNOWA also serves as the Chair of the Mixed Commission. 30. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was also provided with information on staffing levels for the special political missions since 2008. The Committee notes that compared with the total number of 4,929 staff for 2008, the proposed staffing for 2014 is 3,845 for the 34 missions included in document A/68/327 and Add.1-6. For senior level positions, a comparison between 2008 and 2014 shows an increase in the number of positions at the Assistant Secretary-General level (from 12 to 17) and at the D-2 level (from 9 to 13), while the positions at the level of Under-Secretary-General have remained the same (16) and D-1 positions have decreased (from 39 to 37) (see table 6 below; see also table 1 above). The Committee is of the view that the Secretary-General should monitor the staffing trends of the special political missions. Table 6 Staffing requirements from 2008 to 2014 at the D-1 level and above D-2 D-1 2008 Approved 2009 Approved 2010 Approved 2011 Approved 2012 Approved 2013 Approved 2014 Proposed Abbreviations: ASG, Assistant Secretary-General; USG, Under-Secretary-General. United Nations guard force 31. The Advisory Committee recalls that UNAMI has been, until now, the only mission where the United Nations guard force has been deployed (a total of 272 contingent personnel of the Guard Unit is proposed for 2014 (see A/68/327/Add.5, para. 62)). The Committee notes that further deployment of the United Nations guard force is being considered for UNSOM and BINUCA. The Security Council has authorized such deployment in support of UNSOM in its resolution 2124 (2013). Resource requirements for the deployment have not been included in the budget proposal but will be presented during 2014 (see A/68/327/Add.7, para. 20). The Committee was informed that the Council took note of the proposed deployment by the Secretary-General of such a guard force for BINUCA, and that the initial deployment of 250 troops was planned before the end of 2013 to be covered under commitment authority. The Committee notes the planned deployment of the United Nations guard force in more special political missions and recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General, in the context of the budget proposals for 2015, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the deployment of such guard forces at special political missions, including their modalities, criteria and support and backstopping requirements, as well as differences and similarities to the deployment of troops to peacekeeping missions. Integrated mission 32. With respect to integrated missions, in response to its enquiry on how integration is currently achieved, the Advisory Committee was informed that the system-wide integrated assessment and planning policy, which was adopted in April 2013 and which supersedes the guidelines on the integrated mission planning process, sets out the framework for integration in the United Nations system. The policy applies in all cases where a field-based special political mission (or multidimensional peacekeeping operation) is deployed alongside a United Nations country team, or where such a presence is being considered. The policy lays out four minimum requirements to achieve integration: (a) joint strategic assessments; (b) common United Nations vision, priorities and respective responsibilities, including the integrated strategic framework; (c) integrated mechanisms for joint strategic and operational matters at both field and Headquarters levels; and (d) integrated monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the integrated strategic framework. Moreover, the principles of integration apply to missions irrespective of the structural arrangements of a mission and the United Nations country team. Integration can thus be achieved structurally (such as a triple-hatted Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General/Resident Coordinator/ Humanitarian Coordinator), programmatically (through joint programmes) and strategically (through the application of the integrated assessment and planning policy). 33. With reference to the information provided in paragraphs 67 to 70 of the report of the Secretary-General, in response to its enquiry as to whether an integrated strategic assessment could also envisage an exit strategy at the beginning of a mission, the Advisory Committee was informed, inter alia, that a strategic assessment normally included an analysis of a conflict, priority objectives and strategic options for United Nations engagement. As such, while a strategic assessment conducted at the deployment stage of a special political mission could already envisage an exit strategy, this would normally be considered in more detail in the integrated strategic framework. The framework consists of the main findings from integrated assessments, a clear definition of peace consolidation priorities, all programmatic functions and operational areas requiring an integrated approach, agreed results, timelines, responsibilities and a common monitoring and reporting framework. In addition, a strategic assessment, also referred to as a strategic review, should also be carried out following a significant change in the situation or prior to a substantial change in a mission's mandate. This could include a decision to undertake a transition where an exit strategy would be required. ` Cooperation and coordination between the Department of Political Affairs, Department of Peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field Support 34. The Advisory Committee notes that, in response to a request by the Committee (A/67/604, para. 38), the Secretary-General has included information on the cooperation of the three Departments involved in supporting the special political missions at Headquarters in his report (A/68/327, paras. 40-46). The Committee notes from the report that to ensure close coordination among the three departments, the three Under-Secretaries-General sent a note to all staff on 2 July 2013 outlining steps to improve the cooperation and communication between the three departments in order to provide the best possible service to the Secretary-General, Member States and the field presences. Furthermore, the Department of Field Support and the Department of Political Affairs are in the process of jointly reviewing the existing service-level agreement on administrative and logistical support provided by the Department of Field Support to field-based missions led by the Department of Political Affairs, with a view to updating it to reflect new mechanisms and arrangements under the global field support strategy. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the review of the agreement is still ongoing and that it is not perceived as a financial document that would lead to any efficiencies or savings, but rather it is intended to reflect the changes and the developments in both Departments so as to maintain the relevance of the agreement. The Committee recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to further improve the cooperation and coordination among the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Field Support and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Global field support strategy 35. The Secretary-General provides information with respect to progress on the implementation of the global field support strategy in paragraphs 52 to 56 of his report (A/68/327). His third annual progress report on the support strategy outlines the end-state vision of the strategy for service delivery at all levels of support: (a) at United Nations Headquarters; (b) at the Global Service Centre at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy; (c) at the Regional Service Centre at Entebbe, Uganda; and (d) within special political missions and peacekeeping missions. The impact of the support strategy on the operations of the special political missions and some related activities presented by the Secretary-General include the following: (a) Support from the Global Service Centre to UNSMIL in its first year of operation resulted in $2.5 million in savings for the Organization, which were achieved by placing 15 staff members providing support to the mission at the Centre in Brindisi rather than at the mission in Libya (the calculation of the savings is explained in paragraph 53 of the report); (b) The Regional Service Centre at Entebbe currently provides shared services to eight field missions in East Africa: three missions led by the Department of Political Affairs (BINUCA, BNUB and UNSOM); four missions led by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei and United Nations Mission in South Sudan) and UNSOA, which supports the African Union Mission in Somalia. Transactional and non-location-dependent elements of human resources, finance, multimodal movement and control, personnel and cargo transport and information and communications technology support are centralized at the regional level. In that regard, BINUCA, BNUB and UNSOM will be contributing a combined total of $155,500 to the operational resources of the Regional Service Centre during the financial period 2013/14; (c) The Department of Field Support is assessing various "shared services" support models, including the Global Service Centre and the Regional Service Centre, the Kuwait Joint Support Office and instances of inter-mission cooperation in the area of field support. These efforts are intended to identify opportunities and parameters for improved service delivery to current and future operations, including new mission start-ups in Somalia (UNSOM, led by the Department of Political Affairs) and Mali (MINUSMA, led by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations); (d) With respect to the implementation of the operational mission procurement and acquisition support service initiative, a comprehensive update on the initiative will be provided in the second resumed part of the sixty-eighth session, in the context of the overview of the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations. 36. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that for the next report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the global field support strategy, the Department of Field Support intends to outline its overall approach to shared services in field missions. In particular the Department seeks to present its proposed approach for: (a) strengthening common management and oversight tools for shared service delivery in support of standardization and service improvement, and (b) identifying an optimal global shared service architecture through a business case analysis to expand the benefits of shared service delivery to all peacekeeping and special political missions. This analysis will be undertaken inclusive of the future potentials of Umoja. The Committee recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to provide more comprehensive information on the benefits of the global field support strategy for the special political missions in his next annual progress report on the support strategy. Kuwait Joint Support Office 37. The Secretary-General indicates that since the official launch of the Kuwait Joint Support Office in December 2012, the integration of UNAMA and UNAMI personnel and processes into a single, consolidated and client-focused entity is progressing as planned (A/68/327, paras. 57-61). The Office will remain a jointly funded integral component of both UNAMA and UNAMI, funded through the assessed budgets of the two missions, and will be scalable to the requirements of the two missions. Of the 86 positions proposed for the Office for 2014, 44 positions are funded from the UNAMA budget and 42 positions from the UNAMI budget. Accountability for the performance of the Office remains with both missions. 38. The Secretary-General provides information under cost-benefit analysis in paragraphs 62 to 66 of his report (A/68/327). According to the report, there are savings as a result of the lower international staff costs in Kuwait compared with Afghanistan and Iraq. Furthermore, the Human Resources Section of the Kuwait Joint Support Office has the capacity and the ability to support the current client missions, as well as additional smaller missions if there is a need. Consequently, a positive result of the establishment of the Office has been the delegation of authority to it to support the Office of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Yemen, within existing resources. The Advisory Committee is of the view that the Secretary-General has not provided sufficient information on the costs and benefits of the Kuwait Joint Support Office. For example, some areas of improvement identified by the Secretary-General as a result of the establishment of the Office, such as reviewing and streamlining business processes and managing operations against performance indicators, are identical to all missions and offices. The Committee, therefore, recommends that the General Assembly requests the Secretary-General to provide full costs and benefits of the Office in the budget for 2015 for the special political missions. 39. The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretary-General indicated in his latest overview report on peacekeeping operations that, for the period 2013/14, he would focus on realizing the full integration and effectiveness of human resources and financial transactional processes that have been transferred to the Regional Service Centre at Entebbe before proposing additional centres (A/67/723, para. 143). In the Committee's view, the establishment and development of the Kuwait Support Office seems to be in contradiction to this statement, as the Office performs functions and has arrangements similar to the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe. The Committee recalls the General Assembly decisions concerning possible additional regional centres (resolution 64/269, sect. VI, para. 25, and resolution 66/264, para. 58) and recommends that the Secretary-General be requested to provide full justification on this issue in the next overview report on peacekeeping operations. Support services 40. The Advisory Committee notes from the budget documents that for some missions, support services provided to them are reimbursed, while for others they are provided free of charge. The Committee sought clarification and was informed, inter alia, that for special political missions supported by the Department of Political Affairs, services provided by other missions or offices away from headquarters are provided free of charge in cases where there is no added cost to the performing office. Where there are added costs, these extra costs are charged to the requesting mission (for example, if a special envoy travels to a country with a special political or peacekeeping mission, the field mission may assign drivers and vehicles available at the mission to the special envoy, as the vehicles are already acquired and the drivers are already contracted by the mission. However, any overtime for the drivers and fuel for the vehicles would be charged to the budget of the special envoy). 41. The Advisory Committee also enquired as to how reimbursements for support services would be captured in the context of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The Committee was informed that currently under the United Nations system accounting standards, reimbursements of actual expenditures incurred are credited to the accounts against which they were originally charged if reimbursement is received in the same financial period; reimbursements received in the current financial period of actual expenditures incurred in prior financial periods are credited as miscellaneous income. However, under IPSAS, expenses incurred and reimbursements received for cost recovery will be shown separately in the financial statements. Following the full accrual basis of accounting under IPSAS, revenue will be booked in the financial period when the Organization renders services and has the right to receive reimbursements for the expenses incurred, regardless of when the cash or its equivalent is received or paid. 42. The Advisory Committee is of the view that for budgetary transparency and accuracy, all measurable support services provided to the special political missions should be captured and reported in the performance reports. IV. Specific recommendations on resource requirements A. Thematic cluster I: special and personal envoys, and special advisers of the Secretary-General 43. The main report of the Secretary-General includes the total resource requirements for the 11 special political missions under thematic cluster I (A/68/327, tables 4 and 6). However, while resources for 10 special political missions are presented in document A/68/327/Add.1, the requirement for the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria is proposed in document A/68/327/Add.6 (see paras. 71-91 below). The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the reason for the issuance of the proposed budget for the Office of the Joint Special Representative as a separate addendum was because the decision to relocate the office from Cairo to Geneva was made in late August 2013, and it was decided not to delay the publication of the budget report for the rest of the missions under cluster I (A/68/327/Add.1). Table 7 Summary of resource requirements for thematic cluster Ia Category Requirements for 2014 Total requirements for 2013 Variance, 2013-2014 Estimated expenditure Non-recurrent United Nation Representative to the Geneva International Discussions Office of the Special Envoy for the Sudan and South Sudan a Excludes requirements for the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria. 44. As shown in table 7 above, the resources proposed for the 10 missions under thematic cluster I for 2014 amount to $24,904,800 (net), representing an increase of $4,658,900, compared with the resources approved for 2013. The increase in the resources proposed for 2014 is mainly attributable to the requirements for the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region, which was established in March 2013 and funded during the year under the commitment authority of the Secretary-General under the provisions of General Assembly resolution 66/249 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for the biennium 2012-2013 (ibid., para. 248). The net decrease of $9,900 for the nine continuing missions is the result of an increase of $724,600 proposed for the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Yemen (see paras. 47 (c) and 48 below), offset by decreases for the other eight missions in the cluster. 45. For the biennium 2012-2013, expenditures through 31 December 2013 are projected at $31,806,200, compared with the appropriation of $33,957,000 for the biennium, leading to a projected unencumbered balance of $2,150,800. The variance of $2,150,800 is mainly attributable to reduced requirements, inter alia, for (a) the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Cyprus ($560,400), owing to a higher-than-budgeted vacancy rate and underexpenditures under consultants, communications and other supplies, services and equipment; and (b) the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions ($423,800), owing to lower-than-budgeted official travel as a result of a reduced number of meetings for the Joint Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism (ibid., paras. 42 and 139). Information on the variances for each mission is provided under the respective mission in the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327/Add.1). Comments and recommendations on posts 46. Table 8 below presents positions approved for 2013, the vacancy situation as at 30 September 2013 and the proposed staffing requirements for 2014 for the 10 missions under cluster I. Table 8 Thematic cluster I: staffing requirementsa Approved for 2013 Vacant positions as at 30 September Proposed for 2014 New positions Abolitions Reclassifications (1 USG, 2 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 GS (OL)) (1 USG, 1 D-1, 3 P-5, 5 P-4, 2 FS, 4 GS (OL), 3 LL) (1 USG, 1 D-2, 3 P-5, 5 P-4, 1 FS, 3 GS (OL), 5 LL) (1 FS to LL, 1 GS (OL) to LL) (1 USG, 1 ASG, 1 P-5, 3 P-4, 2 P-3, 2 GS (OL)) (P-3) (1 USG, 1 ASG, 1 P-5, 3 P-4, 2 P-3, (1 USG, 1 P-3) 1 P-3) (1 USG, 1 P-4, 1 GS (OL)) (P-4) (1 ASG, 1 P-5, 2 P-4, 2 P-3, 1 GS (OL)) (1 ASG, 1 P-5, 2 P-4, 2 P-3, 2 P-4, 1 P-2, 1 GS (OL), 2 NPO, 1 LL) (2 NPO) 1 D-1, 2 P-4, 1 P-3, 2 NPO, 1 LL) (1 GS (OL)) (1 P-2 to P-3) (1 ASG, 1 D-1, 2 P-5, 1 P-4, 2 P-3, 1 GS (OL), 1 NPO, 6 LL) (1 P-4, 1P-3, 1 NPO, 1 LL) (1 ASG, 1 D-1, 2 P-5, 2 P-4, 2 P-3, 2 FS, 1 NPO, 6 LL) (1 P-4, 2 FS) (1 USG, 1 D-2, 3 P-5, 5 P-4, 3 P-3, 2 GS (OL)) (1 D-2, 2 P-5, 3 P-4, 2 P-3) 1 ASG, 3 P-5, 4 P-4, 3 P-3, 1 NPO, 3 LL) 1 (1 LL) (1 D-2 to ASG, 1 P-4 to NPO, 2 GS (OL) to LL) (2 P-5, 2 P-3, 3 LL) 1 ASG, 1 D-1, 4 P-5, 5 P-4, 3 P-3, 1 FS, 2 GS (OL), 1 NPO, 7 LL) Abbreviations: ASG, Assistant Secretary-General; FS, Field Service; GS (OL), General Service (Other level); LL, Local level; NPO, National Professional Officer; USG, Under-Secretary-General. a Excludes staffing requirements for the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria (see paras. 71-91 below). 47. The staffing changes proposed for 2014 under cluster I include the following (ibid., paras. 44, 166, 191-194, 220, 245-247): (a) Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus (2 reclassifications): reclassify one Field Service position (Security Officer) to one Local level position (Security Assistant), and one General Service (Other level) to one Local level (Administrative Assistant); (b) Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sudan and South Sudan (1 reclassification and 1 abolishment): reclassify one P-2 position (of Special Assistant of the Special Envoy/Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the African Union) to the P-3 level, and abolish one General Service (Other level) position in New York, following the relocation from New York to Addis Ababa of the Special Envoy (and the Special Assistant), who has also been appointed the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the African Union; (c) Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Yemen (3 new positions): establish one P-4 position (Public Information Officer); and two Field Service positions (Security Officers) proposed in line with the security assessment performed by the Department of Safety and Security; (d) Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel (4 reclassifications and 1 new position) (see paras. 49 to 56 below); (e) Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region (26 new positions) (see paras. 57 to 60 below). 48. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the staffing changes proposed by the Secretary-General for the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus, the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sudan and South Sudan and the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Yemen. The comments and recommendations of the Committee on staffing requirements related to the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel and to the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region are contained in paragraphs 49 to 60 below. 49. The Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel will be co-located with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for West Africa (UNOWA) in Dakar by 1 January 2014. The Secretary-General indicates that the planned redeployment of personnel from Rome to Dakar would allow for the strong engagement of UNOWA, the United Nations Development Group regional team and the Regional Humanitarian Coordinator in Dakar in the implementation of the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel. Meanwhile, the Special Envoy would continue to be based in Bologna, Italy, on a "when-actually-employed" contract (ibid., paras. 213 and 214; see also para. 55 below). 50. With respect to the relocation of the Office of the Special Envoy from Rome to Dakar, the Advisory Committee recalls that it recommended consideration of such a move, which would allow the Office, owing to closer proximity to or placement in the region, to fully engage and coordinate with the numerous United Nations offices/entities and international actors present in the region that deal with similar issues, as well as allow the Office to better share expertise, political analysis and reporting on developments in the region. The Committee held the view that colocation with one of the United Nations offices in the region, for instance, UNOWA, would allow the Office of the Special Envoy to benefit from its expertise on the region as well as the infrastructure and support available in that Office, thereby reducing requirements for substantive and administrative support, official travel, facilities and other operational costs (A/67/604/Add.3, para. 12). The Advisory Committee welcomes the decision to relocate the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel to the Sahel region, which had been recommended earlier by the Committee. The Committee expects that the Secretary-General will ensure that the relocation of the Office to the region and co-location with UNOWA will achieve greater synergies and efficiencies. 51. A total of 16 positions are proposed by the Secretary-General (1 Under-Secretary-General, 1 Assistant Secretary-General, 3 P-5, 4 P-4, 3 P-3, 1 National Professional Officer, 3 Local level) (A/68/327/Add.1, paras. 219 and 220). The proposed staffing changes include: (a) Reclassification of four positions: one D-2 to Assistant Secretary-General (Head of Office), one P-4 to National Professional Officer (Administrative Officer), and two General Service (Other level) to Local level (Administrative Assistant); (b) Establishment of one additional Local level position (Administrative Assistant). 52. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the reclassifications of one P-4 Administrative Officer position to one National Professional Officer, and two General Service (Other level) positions to two Local level positions. 53. Regarding the reclassification of the D-2 position to Assistant-Secretary-General (Head of Office), the Advisory Committee requested clarifications on the division of the roles between the Special Envoy and the proposed new deputy at Assistant Secretary-General level and whether the proposed arrangement of having one Under-Secretary-General and one Assistant Secretary-General for the Office would be maintained throughout 2014. The Committee was informed that the Special Envoy will continue galvanizing international support and working with the African Development Bank to establish an action fund targeting underfunded regional infrastructure projects in the Sahel. However, the role of the Special Envoy will phase out in 2014 as the mission moves from the planning to the implementation of the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel, the Special Envoy has agreed to the extension of his contract until 31 January 2014, following a request from the Secretary-General, as well as to helping the United Nations maintain the focus of the international attention on the Sahel region, if and when needed in the course of 2014. 54. As for the successor who would take over the responsibilities of the Special Envoy, the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that at this point in time, the Secretary-General does not envisage a replacement at the Under-Secretary-General level and that the proposed Head of Office at the level of Assistant Secretary-General would take over that responsibility, in coordination with the United Nations presence in the region, in order to ensure continued leadership, including senior guidance and political engagement at all levels required for the successful implementation of the Strategy. Based on the information provided above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the proposed reclassification of the position for the Head of Office from D-2 to the Assistant Secretary-General level. 55. The Advisory Committee notes from the information provided to it that the Special Envoy is on a "when-actually-employed" contract and is expected to be engaged 50 per cent of the time. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the phasing out of the Special Envoy was not known at the time of preparing the budget proposal for 2014. Taking into account the envisaged phasing out of the Special Envoy by the end of January 2014, the Advisory Committee recommends that the resources proposed for the position at the Under-Secretary-General level be reduced accordingly. 56. On the proposed new position for Administrative Assistant, the Advisory Committee notes from the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327/Add.1) that, in 2014, the Office of the Special Envoy will benefit from the logistical and infrastructure support provided on site following co-location with UNOWA, which is complemented by services rendered by the Global Service Centre (ibid., para. 205). Taking into account the two existing positions for Administrative Assistants and the support capacity available at UNOWA, the Advisory Committee does not recommend approval of the proposed establishment of an additional position for Administrative Assistant at the Local level. 57. The Secretary-General has proposed a total of 26 positions (1 Under-Secretary-General, 1 Assistant Secretary-General, 1 D-1, 4 P-5, 5 P-4, 3 P-3, 1 Field Service, 2 General Service (Other level), 1 National Professional Officer, 7 Local level), comprising the following positions in three distinct locations (ibid., paras. 245-247). Upon request, the Advisory Committee received an organization chart for the Office of the Special Envoy, which is provided as annex I to the present report: (a) Dublin (3 positions): the Special Envoy (Under-Secretary-General, engaged on a "when-actually-employed" basis), the Special Assistant (P-4) and one Administrative Assistant (General Service (Other level)); (b) Nairobi (21 positions): 14 substantive positions (Special Adviser (Assistant Secretary-General), Chief of Staff (D-1), Senior Political Affairs Officer (P-5), Political Affairs Officers (1 P-4 and 2 P-3), Senior Economic Affairs Officer (P-5), Senior Gender Adviser (P-5), Senior Programme Officer (P-5), Human Rights Officer (P-4), Public Information Officer (P-4), Personal Assistant to the Special Adviser (Field Service) and Administrative Assistants (2 Local level), and seven positions of the support component (Security Coordination Officer (P-3), Administrative Officer (National Professional Officer), Human Resources Assistants (2 Local level), Finance Assistant (Local level) and Drivers (2 Local level)); (c) New York (2 backstopping positions): Political Affairs Officer (P-4) and Administrative Assistant (General Service (Other level)). 58. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, for 2013, of the authorized total of 19 positions (3 positions in Dublin, 14 positions in Nairobi and 2 positions in New York), 13 positions were encumbered as of 4 November 2013 (2 in Dublin, 9 in Nairobi and 2 in New York). 59. The Advisory Committee was also informed, upon enquiry, that, for the period from March to October 2013, the Special Envoy spent a total of 92.5 days (42 per cent of her time) working for the United Nations, comprising 39.5 days in Dublin and 53 days outside, including visits to the region and travel to New York for Security Council briefings. In 2014, the Special Envoy is expected to work 50 per cent of her time in the capacity of Special Envoy, which amounts to 177 days, and will aim to spend 60 per cent of that time (106 days) outside of Dublin. 60. Taking into consideration the number of positions and related functions proposed for the Office of the Special Envoy for 2014, in particular position at the Assistant Secretary-General level in addition to the Special Envoy at the Under-Secretary-General level, as well as the existing capacity at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the Department of Political Affairs, the Advisory Committee does not recommend approval of the following five positions: (a) one Administrative Assistant (General Service (Other level)) in New York; and (b) one Administrative Assistant (Local level), one Human Resources Assistant (Local level), one Political Affairs Officer (P-3) and one Chief of Staff (D-1) in Nairobi. The Committee recommends that the functions of the Chief of Staff be performed by the Senior Political Affairs Officer (P-5). Furthermore, the Committee recommends that the Office consider closer cooperation with missions in the region, in particular the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (53 Political Affairs Officers and 63 Human Rights Officers) and the United Nations Office in Burundi (4 Political Affairs Officers and 6 Human Rights Officers). The Committee recommends approval of 21 of the 26 positions proposed for the Office by the Secretary-General. Vacancy rates 61. Regarding the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Yemen, the Advisory Committee notes from the information provided that no vacancy factor has been applied to provisions for 2014 for international and national staff since all positions are expected to be encumbered throughout the year. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that as at 30 September 2013, actual vacancy rates were 25 per cent and 28.6 per cent for international and national staff, respectively. The Committee further notes that three new positions are proposed for the Office for 2014 for approval by the General Assembly (see para. 5 (c) above). Taking into consideration the current vacancy rates, as well as the time usually required for recruitment, the Advisory Committee recommends that a vacancy factor of 10 per cent be applied to the provisions for both international and national staff for 2014. 62. The Advisory Committee notes that a provision of $1,002,800 is proposed for international staff under the Office of the Special Adviser on Myanmar, when the actual expenditures were much lower in 2012 and 2013 as reflected in table 9 below. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that for both 2012 and 2013, the lower-than-budgeted expenditures for international staff reflect the vacancies experienced and the actual within-grade steps of the staff and their marital/ dependency status, based on how they are paid. The Committee was also informed that no vacancy factor was applied in estimating the budget for 2012 and 2013, and that it is assumed that all positions will be encumbered for the full period in 2014. The Advisory Committee requests that the Secretary-General provide the most updated information on the incumbency rate of the Office of the Special Adviser and on recruitment status, if applicable, to the General Assembly at the time of its consideration of the budget for 2014. Table 9 Budget and expenditure for international staff for 2012 and 2013 (United States dollars) Budget amount Actual/projected expenditure Variance: underexpenditure Comments and recommendations on operational costs 63. The Advisory Committee was provided with information on the operational costs for cluster I, which is shown in table 10 below, including the appropriation and estimated expenditure for 2012-2013 and the projected requirements for 2014. Table 10 Thematic cluster I: operational costsa Variance under- overexpenditure Approved budget 2013 Category of expenditure Consultants Official travel Facilities and infrastructure Ground transportation Air transportation Communications Information technology Other supplies, services and equipment a Excludes requirements for the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria (see paras. 71-91 below). 64. A provision of $24,800 is proposed for consultants for the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Myanmar (ibid., para. 19). The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that after the finalization of the resource requirements for 2014, it has been confirmed that resources for consultancy requirements are no longer required for 2014, as the expertise is now available and work is being done by others within the system, with the increasing normalization of the operations of the United Nations funds and programmes in Myanmar. The Advisory Committee therefore recommends a reduction of $24,800 from the proposed resources for 2014 for the mission. Relocation costs 65. The Advisory Committee requested, but did not receive, information on the total costs associated with the planned relocation from Rome to Dakar of the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel. The Committee was informed that, although no specific amount has been budgeted for relocation costs associated with the move of the Office, any emergent relocation costs are expected to be absorbed within the approved resources. The Advisory Committee is of the view that the costs for the relocation of the Office should be captured and reported in the performance report. Vehicles 66. The Advisory Committee notes from the information provided to it that a provision of $106,300, under ground transportation, is proposed for 2014, including the repairs and maintenance of nine vehicles for the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that there are no acquisitions in the proposed budget, as the mission will receive eight vehicles (7 light passenger vehicles and 1 minibus) to be transferred from the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (based on Department of Field Support standard ratios). The eight vehicles in Nairobi will be maintained through maintenance contractors of the United Nations Support Office for AMISOM (UNSOA). In addition, the budget provides for the rental of a vehicle for the Special Envoy, primarily in Dublin but also during missions to the regions, at an estimated cost of $36,000, based on experience to date. 67. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the planned distribution of the eight vehicles in Nairobi includes one vehicle each for the Special Adviser (Assistant Secretary-General) and the Chief of Staff (D-1), five light passenger vehicles for the remaining 19 staff based in Nairobi and one vehicle as reserve. The Committee requested standard ratios for vehicles at the United Nations Office at Nairobi, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and UNSOA and was informed: (a) that the 2013/14 budget for UNSOA reflects vehicle holdings of 107 vehicles; and (b) that there is a total of 26 vehicles at the United Nations Office at Nairobi, UNEP, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, and the Security and Safety Services in Nairobi, and that, except for the Director-General, executive directors and deputy executive directors, no vehicles are assigned to staff for commuting to and from work and/or for performing official duties. 68. The Advisory Committee is of the view that for the Office of the Special Envoy in Nairobi (B duty station), the provision should include no more than two vehicles (one for the Special Adviser (Assistant Secretary-General) and one as reserve), in addition to the resources ($36,000) for the rental of a vehicle for the Special Envoy, primarily in Dublin but also during missions to the region. The Committee notes from the information above that different ratios for vehicles are applied for offices located at the United Nations Office at Nairobi. The comments of the Committee in this regard are contained in section III above, under General observations and recommendations. Computing devices 69. The Advisory Committee further notes from the information provided to it that the acquisition of equipment, including computers, servers, network switches and routers, is estimated at $228,100 for the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region. Upon enquiry, that Committee was informed that the computers required are new, owing to the establishment of the new mission, and that the proposed number of computing devices in support of the Office includes 31 laptops (26 laptops for staff and 5 laptops as spares) and eight tablet devices (7 tablets for the following: 1 Under-Secretary-General, 1 Assistant Secretary-General, 1 D-1 and 4 P-5) at a total cost of $24,200, as well as associated spare parts for two locations (Dublin and Nairobi). Maintenance and repair requirements are based on Department of Field Support standard ratios. The Committee also requested standard ratios for computing devices and was informed that in respect of computing devices, the overall ratio for staff is one device per user; however, some staff, such as Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, may have more than one device (such as a desktop and a laptop to ensure full access to all information and communications technology capabilities). In this regard, the Committee was informed that an iPad is not considered a computer since it does not have all the functionality required to replace a desktop computer or a laptop. The Advisory Committee is of the view that acquisition for computing devices should be based on the standard ratios and be kept to a minimum, as appropriate. 70. In addition, taking into account its recommendations against one position for the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Sahel, and the five positions proposed for the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region (see paras. 56 and 60 above), the Advisory Committee recommends that related non-post resources for 2014 for the Offices be reduced accordingly. 71. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed resource requirements for 2014 for the Office of the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria (A/68/327/Add.6). During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification, concluding with written responses received on 27 November 2013. Background and mandate 72. In his report, the Secretary-General states that in its resolution 66/253 A, the General Assembly had requested the Secretary-General and all relevant United Nations bodies to provide support to the efforts of the League of Arab States, both through good offices aimed at promoting a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis, including through the appointment of a Special Envoy, and through technical and material assistance, in consultation with the League. On 21 March 2012, a six-point plan presented by Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan was endorsed in a presidential statement of the Security Council (S/PRST/2012/6), followed by a formal endorsement by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic. On 30 June 2012, the international Action Group for Syria, meeting in Geneva, issued a communiqué (S/2012/523) identifying steps and measures by the parties to secure the full implementation of the six-point plan and Security Council resolutions 2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012) (ibid., paras. 1-6). 73. According to the report, the General Assembly subsequently adopted resolution 66/253 B, in which the Assembly condemned the increasing use of heavy weapons, human rights violations, and all violence, irrespective of its source, including terrorist acts. The Assembly also called upon the Syrian parties to cooperate with the Joint Special Envoy with the aim of implementing the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012. Following the decision of Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan not to continue his functions as Joint Special Envoy, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, together with the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, appointed Lakhdar Brahimi the Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of Arab States for Syria. In its resolution 67/262, on the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, the Assembly reiterated a call for an inclusive Syrian-led political transition and reaffirmed its support for the mission of the Joint Special Representative (ibid., paras. 8-10). 74. The Secretary-General indicates that on 7 May 2013, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the Secretary of State of the United States of America agreed to convene an international conference as a follow-up to the June 2012 meeting of the Action Group for Syria, with the aim of bringing the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and the opposition together to determine how to fully implement the Geneva communiqué. On 27 September 2013, by its resolution 2118 (2013), the Security Council endorsed the decision of the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons. The Council also endorsed the Geneva communiqué and called for the convening, as soon as possible, of an international conference on the Syrian Arab Republic with the aim of implementing the Geneva communiqué (ibid., paras. 13 and 14). 75. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the Office had contributed to the start-up of the advance team of the joint Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations mission on an ad hoc basis by sharing background information and some of the resources positioned in Damascus, including logistical, protocol and entry visa support, and the loan of 13 armoured vehicles, one armoured ambulance and information and communications technology equipment. The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to include more detailed information on the resources and support provided by the Office to the joint mission in the next budget submission. 76. The Secretary-General states that the activities of the Joint Special Representative are expected to be as follows: (a) to use good offices to bring an end to all violence and human rights violations and to facilitate a Syrian-led peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis; (b) to work with all relevant entities of the United Nations and the League of Arab States to provide support for efforts to end the violence and promote a political solution; and (c) to brief the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Ministerial Council and the Ministerial Follow-up Committee of the League of Arab States (ibid., para. 15). Cooperation with other entities 77. In paragraph 16 of his report, the Secretary-General explains that the Office will receive substantive and administrative support from the Department of Political Affairs and the Department of Field Support, and will continue to consult and coordinate closely with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations; the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; the agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system operating in the region and in the Syrian Arab Republic; and the United Nations country team in the Syrian Arab Republic. Relocation to the United Nations Office at Geneva 78. The Secretary-General indicates that, effective 1 September 2013, the Office was relocated to the United Nations Office at Geneva to facilitate the preparation for the second international conference on the Syrian Arab Republic, as mentioned in paragraph 74 above (ibid., para. 20). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Secretary-General would convene the conference and that the Joint Special Representative would mediate between the Syrian sides within the framework of intra-Syrian negotiations. The Committee was also informed that since the conference is designed as an open-ended facility for intra-Syrian negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement on the implementation of the Geneva communiqué, it could be held over an indefinite period of time, ranging from a few weeks to several months, and that maintaining a presence in Cairo would therefore not have been cost-effective and would have posed operational challenges. The Committee was further informed that the decision to relocate to Geneva was taken by the Secretary-General upon consultation with the League of Arab States and that the cost of relocation, the main part of which amounts to $185,000, related to the cost of the tickets and the payment of the staff entitlements, such as assignment and relocation grants, would be absorbed within the 2013 budget (see also para. 83 below). 79. The Secretary-General states that all 25 positions that were initially based in Cairo have been redeployed to Geneva. An office continues to be maintained in Damascus, comprising 50 positions, and three positions are based in New York at the Department of Political Affairs to provide substantive back-stopping support to the Office (ibid., para. 20). 80. With respect to mission support staffing requirements, the Secretary-General indicates that the Office will continue to leverage existing capacities, including those of the regional Middle East missions, and the United Nations Office at Geneva for the provision of administrative support and logistics coordination. This will complement the Office's mission support component of five positions deployed in Geneva and eight positions in Damascus (ibid., para. 21). The Advisory Committee reiterates its support for the use of common and shared services and global management of resources, in order to improve timeliness and quality of service and to achieve greater efficiency and economies of scale, as well as for greater transparency and a clearer distribution of resources in budget proposals (see A/66/718, para. 186). 81. The Secretary-General also states that the Office will enter into a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Office at Geneva for support on a cost-reimbursable basis (see A/68/327/Add.6, para. 21). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the terms of the memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Office at Geneva had yet to be finalized, but it was anticipated that the following services would be provided on a cost reimbursement basis: (a) recruitment, administration and payroll of local staff; (b) rental of office space, including utilities, messenger services, stationery, safety and security; (c) travel and local transport services; (d) local procurement; (e) payments to vendors based on the financial authorizations; (f) travel claims for all Geneva-based staff; (g) training, medical and welfare for staff; (h) information communications and technology; and (i) conference and meeting services support. The Committee was also informed that those costs would be reimbursed on an actual basis, would not include any additional administrative or service fees and were included in the budget proposal (see also para. 86 below). Proposed resource requirements for 2014 82. Estimated requirements for the Office for 2014 amount to $12,365,300 (net of staff assessment), representing an increase of $119,100, compared with the total requirements for 2013. The proposed resource requirements for 2014 will provide for civilian personnel costs ($8,085,800) for 78 positions, representing the same total number of positions approved for 2013. The estimated requirements also include operational costs ($4,279,500), comprising consultants ($200,000), official travel ($1,586,300), facilities and infrastructure ($690,800), ground transportation ($204,800), communications ($774,500), information technology ($33,100) and other supplies, services and equipment ($790,000) (ibid., para. 25, and tables 2 and 3). 83. In paragraph 29 of his report, the Secretary-General explains that the variance between the proposed resources for 2014 and the approved budget for 2013 is attributable mainly to the relocation of the Office to Geneva, offset mostly by decreases under operational costs, mainly under facilities and infrastructure as well as other supplies, services and equipment related to mediation activities. The supplementary information indicates that increased requirements are reflected mainly under international staff ($1,689,700) and national staff ($117,800), offset partly by decreased requirements mainly under facilities and infrastructure ($633,500), other supplies, services and equipment related to mediation activities ($500,000) and official travel ($471,100). 84. Upon enquiry, in respect of the increased requirements under national staff ($117,800), the Advisory Committee was informed that the increase was driven by two factors: (a) application of the current salary scale for national staff based in the Syrian Arab Republic, derived from the conversion of the local salary scale in Syrian pounds to United States dollars, implemented as a special mitigating measure against the deterioration of economic conditions ($150,900); and (b) budgeted requirements for danger pay in Syria for 2014 not included in the 2013 budget ($87,900). The increases were offset partially by the proposed abolition of eight Cairo-based Local level positions budgeted at $121,000 in total. The Committee recalls that the same measure as in subparagraph (a) above was proposed in respect of the 2013-2014 proposed budget of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, to which the Committee had no objections (see A/67/780/Add.1, paras. 23-27). Positions 85. The 78 proposed positions comprise 1 Under-Secretary-General, 1 Assistant Secretary-General, 1 D-2, 2 D-1, 6 P-5, 9 P-4, 7 P-3, 13 Field Service, 14 General Service (Other level) and 24 Local level. The Advisory Committee notes from supplementary information provided to it that 13 General Service (Other level) positions are proposed to be established, in lieu of 5 Field Service and 8 Local level positions, resulting in no net change in the total number of 78 positions. A vacancy rate of 30 per cent has been applied in estimating civilian personnel costs for positions in Damascus and New York, and a vacancy rate of 27 per cent has been applied for positions in Geneva (see A/68/327/Add.6, para. 25). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the actual average vacancy rate from January to September 2013 was 41 per cent for international staff and 31 per cent for national staff. 86. Of the total of 78 positions being proposed, 30 fall under the substantive component (comprising 15 in Geneva, 12 in Damascus and 3 in New York), 13 under the support component (with 5 in Geneva and 8 in Damascus), and 35 under the security component (comprising 5 in Geneva and 30 in Damascus) (see ibid., paras. 26-28). Upon enquiry, in respect of the five security personnel proposed for Geneva, the Advisory Committee was informed that those staff would be required for the preparations for the conference, in order to establish dedicated access control to the immediate office of the Joint Special Representative, while the United Nations Office at Geneva would provide security-related services around the main gate of the United Nations Office at Geneva compound as well as perimeter security. Any additional security-related services provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva would be provided on a cost reimbursement basis (see also para. 81 above). The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly request that the Secretary-General consider whether the functions of the proposed five security personnel could be included in the memorandum of understanding with the United Nations Office at Geneva for provision of the related services on a cost reimbursement basis, and reflect this in the next budget submission, if necessary. 87. The Advisory Committee notes from supplementary information provided to it that the 2014 budget proposal excludes provisions for two Government-provided personnel, which had previously been included in the resource requirements, since these pertained to two ex-military advisers who are currently funded from extrabudgetary resources at the P-3 level. The Office proposes that this arrangement continue in 2014. While the Advisory Committee has no objections to the conversion of the two Government-provided personnel to the P-3 level, it recommends that, in view of the continuing nature of the related functions, the positions be funded under the regular budget instead of extrabudgetary resources. 88. Subject to its recommendation in paragraph 87 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the proposed resources for 2014. Extrabudgetary resources 89. The Secretary-General states that the Office will also be supported through the Trust Fund in Support of the Department of Political Affairs, with the total amount of $3,475,000 expected by the end of 2013. These resources cover the requirements for a total of 10 positions, comprising one Director (D-2), six Political Affairs Officers (4 P-4 and 2 P-3) and one Administrative Assistant (General Service (Other level)) in New York; and two positions (P-3) in Damascus. It is stated that extrabudgetary resources are being sought from donors for similar needs in 2014 as in 2013 (see A/68/327/Add.6, paras. 30-33). 90. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the 10 positions were funded through extrabudgetary resources, rather than assessed resources, since they related to temporary surge requirements in the Office and in the Department of Political Affairs. The Committee was further informed that, apart from the two positions referred to in paragraph 87 above, the remaining eight positions comprised four positions (1 D-2, 2 P-4, 1 General Service (Other level)) based in New York to work on the inter-agency process for post-conflict planning, including managing the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Syrian Crisis; and four positions (2 P-4 and 2 P-3 Political Affairs Officers) based in the Middle East and West Asia Division of the Department of Political Affairs to cover regional issues arising from the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, which fell within the mandate of the Department and were not exclusively dedicated to providing substantive support to the Joint Special Representative and his staff. The Committee was also provided with a description of the functions of the positions (see annex II). 91. The Advisory Committee is not convinced that these requirements should be funded under extrabudgetary resources, rather than assessed resources, considering that some of the functions are essential for the provision of back-stopping support to the Office. The Committee recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to clarify in his next budget submission the rationale for funding the positions through extrabudgetary resources. In that context, the Committee also recommends that the Assembly request the Secretary-General to include in the next budget submission clear information on the positions that are cost-shared among the funds and programmes and relevant Secretariat departments, including on the specific share of the Department of Political Affairs in respect of any such cost-sharing arrangements. B. Thematic cluster II: sanctions monitoring teams, groups and panels 92. The resource requirements proposed for 2014 for the 11 special political missions under thematic cluster II amount to $32,418,800 (net), representing an increase of $1,037,800, compared with the resources approved for 2013. The increase in the resources proposed for 2014 is mainly attributable to the provision for the relocation of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate, partially offset by reduced requirements under travel (see para. 98 below). 93. The Advisory Committee was informed of efforts to improve efficiency in the following areas under cluster II, inter alia: (a) maximizing alternative methods of communication, especially videoteleconferencing (see para. 98 below); (b) steadily reducing reliance on consultants; the requests for consultants have decreased from nine in 2010, to eight in 2011, five in 2012 and 2013, and two in 2014 (for example, it is assessed that for the Panel of Experts on the Sudan established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1591 (2005), the expert on international humanitarian law can effectively cover issues relating to sexual and gender-based violence, thus obviating the need for a consultancy in sexual and gender-based violence); (c) reviewing and rationalizing costs related to communication by providing guidance to all home-based panels on ways to keep costs down without having an impact on effectiveness. 94. As shown in table 11 above, at the end of the biennium 2012-2013 the estimated total expenditures for the biennium for cluster II would amount to $60,432,100, against the appropriation of $61,632,500, leaving a projected unencumbered balance of $1,200,400. Information on the variance for each mission listed in table 11 above is provided under the respective mission in the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327/Add.2). Comments and recommendations on positions 95. Table 12 below presents positions approved for 2013, the vacancy situation as at 30 September 2013 and the proposed staffing requirements for 2014 for the 11 missions under cluster II. Table 12 Thematic cluster II: staffing requirements Vacant positions as at (1 P-3, 5 LL) (1 P-3) (2 P-3, (1 P-4, 1 P-3, Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1526 (2004) concerning Al-Qaida and the Taliban and associated individuals and entities (1 P-5, 2 P-4, 3 P-3, 6 GS (OL)) (1 P-5, 2 P-4, 3 P-3, (1 P-5, 2 P-3, (1 ASG, 1 D-2, 2 D-1, 9 P-5, 12 P-4, 4 P-3, 4 P-2, 1 GS (PL), 7 GS (OL)) (1 P-4, 1 D-2, 2 D-1, 9 P-5, 12 P-4, 4 P-3, 4 P-2, 1 GS (PL), Abbreviations: GS (OL), General Service (Other level). 96. A provision of $128,000 for 2014 is proposed for charges pertaining to three security officers provided by the United Nations Office at Nairobi on a cost-reimbursement basis to provide security services and escort to the experts of the Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea (A/68/327/Add.2, para. 16). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the requirement for the armed United Nations security officer escorts with United Nations drivers and vehicles for secure ground transport within Kenya was based on the security assessment conducted by the Department of Safety and Security in 2010 and updated in August 2011. While the Department of Safety and Security has made the recommendations, the decision to travel with security escort is left to the experts and the Coordinator of the Monitoring Group, in collaboration with the Department of Safety and Security. During 2013, the Group has not used such security escorts. In this connection, the Committee notes from the information provided to it that of the provision of $108,800 for 2013 for security escort, expenditure is projected at $78,000. The Advisory Committee therefore requests that explanations for the projected expenditure for 2013 for security escorts be provided to the General Assembly. The Advisory Committee again stresses the need for greater clarity on the requirements of the Organization in respect of safety and security (A/68/7, paras. V.78 and XII.17). The Committee expects that the Secretary-General will respond to its request contained in paragraph XII.17 of document A/68/7 no later than the proposed programme budget for 2016-2017. 97. The Advisory Committee was provided with information on the operational costs for cluster II, which is shown in table 13 below, including the appropriation and estimated expenditure for 2012-2013 and the projected requirements for 2014. Table 13 Thematic cluster II: operational costs 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013 Variance 2013-2014 Appropriations under- (over-) expenditures Experts Travel of experts 98. A provision of $14,767,500 for 2014 for experts, including their travel requirements, is included for 10 of the 11 special political missions in cluster II (see table 13 above), representing an overall reduction of $656,300 (or 4 per cent) (A/68/327, para. 103). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the overall reduction of $656,300 is the net result of a reduction of $1,034,700 in travel (see table 14 below), offset partly by an increase in the fees of experts in the amount of $378,400. According to the Secretary-General, the reduced requirements for experts is a result of the reduction in the amount of travel to be undertaken by the experts, since, with the exception of the Coordinator, experts will participate in the presentation of their initial and midterm briefings by videoconference. Reductions are also attributed to the change in the standards of accommodation for air travel for the experts on consultancy contracts, as a result of General Assembly resolution 67/254 (ibid.). The Advisory Committee notes that the Secretariat has classified the contractual status of the experts as "consultants". Table 14 Travel of experts: comparison between 2013 and 2014 Reduction Panel of Experts on Democratic People's Republic of Korea 99. The Advisory Committee enquired as to why the experts have the status of consultants and when such status had been accorded to them. The Committee was informed that the expert panels are established by the Security Council to assist the subsidiary bodies of the Council. Since the establishment of the first panels and the consequent recruitment of experts, the administrative status of "consultant" is considered suitable, taking into account the temporary and flexible nature of their work and of the sanctions committees. The status of "consultant" allows the sanctions committees to promptly establish and adjust the composition of panels depending on the latest modifications of the sanctions regimes. Furthermore, members of panels are accorded the status of "expert on mission" and their status is regulated by Secretary-General bulletin ST/SGB/2002/9, on Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials, and Experts on Mission. The Advisory Committee notes that some of the experts on mission, whose status is regulated by the provisions contained in the bulletin, are exempted from the change in the standards of accommodation for air travel stipulated by the General Assembly in resolution 67/254. 100. With respect to the standard of accommodation for air travel, in particular paragraph 18 of the report of the Advisory Committee (A/66/739), the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the interpretation by the Security Council Affairs Division of the paragraph is that the definition/condition set out in the paragraph applies to all consultants appointed as experts in sanctions monitoring teams, groups and panels. It was indicated to the Committee that, in line with General Assembly resolution 67/254, taking into account the relevant reports of the Committee (A/66/739 and A/67/636), and of the Secretary-General (A/66/676 and A/67/356), experts on consultancy contracts are not subject to the exemptions enumerated in paragraph 8 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/66/676), but fall instead under paragraph 89 of the same report. The Committee recalls that, in paragraph 18 of its report (A/66/739), the Committee had no objections to the measure establishing economy class as the standard of accommodation for air travel for consultants and individual contractors, on the understanding that payment for the expenses incurred for the professional services rendered to the Organization by consultants and individual contractors is based on an all-inclusive fee that covers the costs of the performance of their contracted functions, including official travel. Taking into account the distinct nature of the work of the experts under the sanctions monitoring teams, groups and panels versus those of other personnel under consultant contracts, the Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly extend the exemptions, referred to in paragraph 8 of the reports of the Secretary-General (A/66/676), to the experts under the sanctions monitoring teams, groups and panels. 101. The Advisory Committee notes from the information provided to it that a provision of $3,000,400 is requested for 2014 for the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate to cover, inter alia: (a) the annual rent for office space and related support services provided in the Chrysler Building on the basis of a memorandum of understanding between the Executive Directorate and the primary leaseholder, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) ($1,010,500); and (b) the relocation of the Executive Directorate from the Chrysler Building to a new office space from 1 January 2015 owing to the intention of UNOPS to move from the Chrysler Building upon the expiration of the master lease on 31 December 2014 ($1,983,400). As to why the proposed relocation costs of some $2 million for 2015 is included in the budget for 2014, the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that because the current sublease with UNOPS expires as of 31 December 2014, the Executive Directorate will have to move to new premises on or prior to 1 January 2015. Accordingly, the Executive Directorate will be required to find a new office space through the Facilities Management Service of the Office of Central Support Services in 2014, as well as to make the necessary alterations and purchase furniture and office equipment. 102. According to the Secretary-General, the estimate for relocation is calculated in accordance with standard common services costs in New York since the new location has not yet been identified. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with a breakdown of the costs as set out in table 15 below. The Committee was also informed, upon enquiry, that the Executive Directorate does not own any furniture in the current office premises since all furniture is provided by UNOPS under the lease. In respect of office automation equipment, the Executive Directorate owns 40 desktops and five laptops. The desktop computers were purchased in late 2009 and early 2010 and would therefore need to be replaced by the time the Executive Directorate moves to new premises on 1 January 2015. The five laptops were purchased in 2011. Two multifunctional printers are leased from the Office of Information and Communications Technology. Table 15 Relocation costsa Grade Number of staff Alteration to premises Furniture Office automation equipment Phone/ fax/LAN Assistant Secretary-General P-1 to P-4 General Service 2 020 916b a The estimate is based on the 2012-2013 Estimating guide for Standard Common Services Costs in New York issued by the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts on 12 December 2012. b This amount includes moving costs of $3,000 based on 41 staff members moving without furniture from the Chrysler Building to a location to be determined. 103. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was further informed that since its inception in 2005, the Executive Directorate has been located outside the Secretariat building and that there is no space available for the Executive Directorate in the building. As for the relocation to new premises, the Executive Directorate has been in contact with the Facilities Management Service since November 2012 since the latter is responsible for administering all issues related to the Executive Directorate office space. In July 2013, the Facilities Management Service indicated that there is no office space in its portfolio that is expected to be available as at 1 January 2015. Subsequently, the Executive Directorate has submitted the request to the Facilities Management Service to enter into a new lease agreement on its behalf starting 1 January 2015. However, no space has been identified to this date. 104. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the proposed resources for the relocation of the office of the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate. Other matters 105. With respect to the Executive Directorate, the Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force and the United Nations Centre for Counter-Terrorism, the Advisory Committee requested information on their funding mechanisms, as well as the relationship with the Department of Political Affairs and the Under-Secretary-General of the Department. The Committee was informed of the following, inter alia: (a) The Executive Directorate is mainly funded through the regular budget, and extrabudgetary funds are being used to organize capacity-building workshops and other events on a variety of counter-terrorism themes with a view to enhancing the capacity of Member States to implement Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005). The Executive Director reports to the Counter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council; (b) The Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force Office, as part of the Department of Political Affairs, is funded under the regular budget (subprogramme 6, section 3, Political affairs), as well as through extrabudgetary resources. For the biennium 2014-2015, the resources amount to some $2 million under the proposed programme budget, including six posts (1 D-2, 1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1 P-3 and 2 General Service (Other level)) and non-post resources, while extrabudgetary resources are estimated at some $6.7 million to provide for essential support to fulfil the function of the Office in supporting the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The Head of the Office reports to the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs who is the Chair of the Task Force. Over 30 entities of the Task Force contribute to the counter-terrorism efforts of the United Nations according to their specific organizational mandates; (c) In 2011, through a voluntary contribution, the Secretariat was able to launch the United Nations Centre for Counter-Terrorism. In the same year, the General Assembly adopted resolution 66/10, in which it noted with appreciation the contribution agreement to launch the Centre, welcomed the establishment of the Centre within the Office and encouraged Member States to collaborate with the Centre. Operating under the Secretary-General and the umbrella of the Department of Political Affairs, it contributes to the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. The Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs is the Executive Director of the Centre. The Centre relies on the existing expertise of the Task Force to reinforce current United Nations counter-terrorism initiatives. The Centre benefits from the political support and advice of the 22 members of its Advisory Board, who provide guidance to the Executive Director of the Centre on the Centre's annual plan and programme of work, including its annual budget, programmes, projects and proposals. 106. The Advisory Committee takes note of the information provided to it upon request and expects that the Secretary-General will further clarify in the next budget for special political missions the roles of the three entities and their relationship with the Department of Political Affairs and the Under-Secretary-General of the Department. C. Thematic cluster III: United Nations offices, peacebuilding support offices, integrated offices and commissions 107. The resources proposed for 2014 for the 10 special political missions under cluster III amount to $140,899,600, which represents 26.1 per cent of the total resources requested for all 34 special political missions in 2014 (A/68/327 and A/68/327/Add.3). Table 16 below provides a breakdown, by mission, of the estimated expenditures until 31 December 2013 and the projected requirements for 2014. Table 16 Summary of resource requirements for thematic cluster III United Nations Office for West Africa United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia United Nations Office in Burundi Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa United Nations Support Mission in Libya 108. As indicated in table 16 above, estimated expenditure for the missions in cluster III for 2012-2013 is estimated at $303,793,100, reflecting a projected overexpenditure of $5,124,300, compared with the appropriation of $298,668,800 for 2012-2013. The Advisory Committee notes that the projected overexpenditure for the period relates to the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA) ($4,525,700), resulting from the evacuation of staff and the relocation of mission activities to Yaoundé twice during the budget period; the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) ($1,312,100) owing to lower vacancy rates for international staff and their increased residential security allowance; and the United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi (BNUB) ($435,900) owing mainly to higher-than-budgeted civilian staff costs. The projected overexpenditure is offset in part by underexpenditures of $968,000 for the United Nations Office in Central Africa (UNOCA). Information on the variances for each mission listed in table 16 is provided under the respective mission in the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327/Add.3). 109. For 2014, the estimated requirements of $140,899,600 reflect a decrease of $8,667,500, or 5.8 per cent, when compared with the appropriation of $149,567,100 for 2013. The Advisory Committee notes that the decrease mainly reflects the reduced requirements for UNIPSIL ($8,029,100), resulting mainly from the abolishment of all civilian staff positions; the repatriation of Government-provided personnel; and the reduction in operational costs as a result of the full drawdown of the mission as mandated by the Security Council in resolution 2097 (2013), offset in part by an increase in resources required for the actual physical closure and administrative liquidation of the mission. The decrease is also a result of reduced requirements for the United Nations support for the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission ($1,060,600), which mainly reflect a decrease under operational costs as a result of the effect of the change in the cost-sharing arrangement for a fixed-wing aircraft among the Commission, UNOWA and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Of the other continuing missions, the Advisory Committee notes that resource increases for 2014 have been requested only for BINUCA, the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS) and the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, while the resources requested for the other missions represent decreases when compared to the approved resources for 2013, with the exception of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, the requested sources for which have remained at the same level as 2013. Comments and recommendation on positions 110. The approved positions under cluster III for 2013, the vacancy situation as at 30 September 2013 and the proposals of the Secretary-General for 2014 are summarized in table 17 below. The comments of the Advisory Committee and its recommendations on variances, resource requirements and staffing proposals are set out under the discussion of the individual missions in the paragraphs that follow.

The staffing changes proposed for 2014 under cluster III include the following (ibid., paras. 19, 67, 93-94, 179, 218 and 271): (a) UNOWA: establish one National Professional Officer position (Public Information Officer) (see paras. 116 and 117 below); (b) UNIOGBIS: establish five new positions (1 D-2 Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Political), and 4 National Professional Officer (Political Affairs Officer, Human Rights Officer, Security Sector Reform Officer and Public Information Officer); abolish 3 positions (1 P-5 Senior Security Sector Reform Officer, 1 P-4 Political Affairs Officer and 1 P-3 Police Officer) (see paras. 128-130 below); (c) UNIPSIL: abolish 27 positions (2 P-5, 2 P-4, 5 P-3, 10 National Professional Officer, 5 Local level, 3 United Nations Volunteers); (d) BNUB: reclassify one Field Service position of Security Service Officer to one National Professional Officer; (e) UNSCOL: Convert one P-5 Senior Administrative Officer to one P-4 Administrative Officer; (f) UNSMIL: establish three new positions (2 P-4 and 1 P-3); abolish 5 positions (1 D-2, 1 P-5, 1 P-3, 1 National Professional Officer and one General Service (Local level)); and reclassify one P-3 position to the P-2 level and one P-3 position to the Field Service category (see paras. 161-164 below). 112. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the staffing changes proposed by the Secretary-General for UNOWA, UNIPSIL, BNUB, UNSCOL and UNSMIL. The comments and recommendations of the Committee on staffing requirements related to UNIOGBIS are contained in paragraph 134 below. 113. Annex VII of the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327) provides a detailed comparison of the budgeted vacancy rates for 2013 and the budgeted vacancy rates for 2014. It also contains information on the actual vacancy rates as at 31 August 2013. Based on the significant variances between the actual vacancy rates as at 31 August 2013 and the budgeted rates for 2014, the Advisory Committee questions whether the budgeted vacancy rates in some missions are realistic. In that regard, the Committee's recommendations on vacancy rate estimates for specific staffing categories in specific missions are indicated, where applicable, under the discussion of the individual missions below. 114. The Advisory Committee was provided with information on the operational costs for cluster III, which is shown in table 18 below, including the appropriation and estimated expenditure for 2012-2013 and the projected requirements for 2014. The comments of the Committee on variances and resource requirements are set out under the discussion of the individual missions. Table 18 Thematic cluster III: operational costs Variance 2013- 2014 Variance Under- (over-) expenditures 1. Government provided personnel 2. Consultants 3. Official travel 4. Facilities and infrastructure 5. Ground transportation 6. Air transportation 7. Naval transportation 8. Communications 9. Information technology 10. Medical 11. Other supplies, services and equipment Total operational costs 115. The estimated requirements for UNOWA for 2014 amount to $9,432,500, compared with the appropriation of $9,702,200 for 2013. The decrease of $269,700 is attributable mainly to a decrease under operational costs ($601,800) as a result of the effect of the change in the cost-sharing arrangement for a fixed-wing aircraft among UNOWA, the United Nations support for the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission and MINUSMA in respect of air operations, as part of a strategy of regional cooperation and shared resources. With the establishment of MINUSMA in Mali, the Secretary-General indicates that the requirement for UNOWA to travel to Mali will be slightly reduced, and its share of a fixed-wing aircraft will correspondingly be reduced. 116. The proposed civilian staffing complement of 44 positions reflects the proposed addition of one new position of Public Information Officer (National Professional Officer) under the Public Information Section to strengthen UNOWA communication and outreach capacity; formulate and implement a communication strategy; and manage public expectations and raise the profile of the Office. The Secretary-General also indicates that the Public Information Officer (National Professional Officer) will assist the existing Public Information Officer (P-4) in the implementation of the Office's communication strategy by organizing public information-related events and press conferences, contributing to the Office's daily press review and media monitoring, as well as maintaining the Office's website and social media platforms. 117. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that for the past three years, until the present time, the functions of the proposed position had been undertaken by a national consultant at a monthly cost of $3,000, totalling $96,198. The Committee was further informed that the provision for consultants for 2014 had been reduced by $30,900, mainly reflecting the discontinuation of the services of the national consultant, functions of which would be undertaken by the proposed Public Information Officer (National Professional Officer) position. 118. In paragraph 5 of his report, the Secretary-General indicates that UNOWA will continue to chair and provide secretarial support to the High-level Policy Committee meetings for the implementation of the West Africa Coast Initiative, which is a joint programme with the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), aiming at capacity-building at both the national and subregional levels in the areas of law enforcement, forensics, border management, anti-money-laundering and the strengthening of criminal justice institutions. 119. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Initiative had been set up to respond to the need for a comprehensive and multi-stakeholder approach to work in synergy to support the implementation of the Economic Community of West African States Regional Action Plan to Address the Growing Problem of Illicit Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime, and Drug Abuse in West Africa. The Committee was further informed that the role of UNOWA within the Initiative was to provide political guidance and promote advocacy for mobilizing the West Africa Coast Initiative States and international support. The Committee was also informed that the proposed resources for 2014 included $20,000 for the organization of one meeting and 20 per cent of the current Security Sector Reform Officer's time. 120. The Advisory Committee recommends an increase in the proposed vacancy rate for 2014 under national staff (Local level) for UNOWA, from 6 per cent to 9 per cent, for the reasons indicated in paragraph 113 above. 121. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the resources proposed for UNOWA for 2014 subject to its recommendation in paragraph 120 above. 122. The estimated requirements for BINUCA for 2014 would amount to $20,877,400, compared with the appropriation of $20,232,500 for 2013. The increase of $644,900 is attributable mainly to an increase in requirements for international staff owing primarily to provision for entitlements in 2014 that were not budgeted for in 2013 (danger pay allowance and non-family hardship allowance), as well as increased requirements under air transportation services as a result of extended flight coverage within the mission area and the increased costs for fixed-wing rental and operation. The increases are offset in part by reduced requirements under facilities and infrastructure, owing mainly to non-provision for the acquisition of prefabricated facilities, security and safety equipment and construction services. 123. During its consideration of the proposals of the Secretary-General, the Advisory Committee was informed that the 2014 budget for the Office had been prepared on the same level and profile of the resources approved for 2013, on the basis that a supplementary budget would be submitted if a new and expanded mandate were adopted by the Security Council. In that event, the Committee was informed that BINUCA would require additional resources to fully implement the recommendations of Council resolution 2121 (2013), in which the Council calls for the reinforcement of BINUCA staffing, deployment of a guard unit, including the establishment of a level II hospital enhanced with surgical and laboratory capabilities, and an increased footprint outside Bangui. 124. The Advisory Committee notes a projected overexpenditure of $4,525,700, or 11.1 per cent, for BINUCA for the 2012-2013 period, attributable mainly to increased civilian personnel costs. In paragraph 25 of his report, the Secretary-General indicates that owing to the security situation, the mission evacuated its staff and relocated its operation to Yaoundé twice during the budget period (in December 2012 and in March 2013). The projected overexpenditure is also a result of the introduction of the danger pay allowance for international and national staff as of 23 March 2013 and the change in the mission's status from a family duty station to a non-family duty station as from 1 July 2013, resulting in the payment of associated entitlements for non-family hardship allowance, all of which were not budgeted for in 2013. 125. The Advisory Committee recommends an increase in the proposed vacancy rate for BINUCA for 2014 under international staff, from 7 per cent to 10 per cent, and under United Nations Volunteers, from 20 per cent to 40 per cent, for the reasons indicated in paragraph 113 above. 126. Subject to its recommendation in paragraph 125 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the resources proposed for BINUCA for 2014. 127. The estimated requirements for 2014 for UNIOGBIS amount to $20,341,600, compared with the appropriation of $19,834,900 for 2013. The net increase of $506,700 for 2014 is attributable mainly to the increase in national staff salaries and common staff costs, owing to the establishment of four National Professional Officer positions in accordance with the recommendations of the technical assistance mission undertaken from 18 to 27 March 2013; increased requirements for facilities and infrastructure, and ground transportation resulting from the higher fuel requirements and the acquisition of additional equipment and furniture for the new regional offices in Bafatá, Buba, São Domingos and Mansôa. The increases are offset in part by a net decrease in the number of positions under international staff in accordance with the technical assistance mission recommendations and reduced requirements for air transportation due to the decrease in the consumption of aviation fuel; and a decrease in the rental and operation of fixed-wing aircraft owing to the reduction in the number of operational days from 150 days in 2013 to 50 days in 2014 resulting from an improvement in the local commercial airline services. 128. The proposed civilian staffing level of 127 staff reflects a net increase of two staff, when compared with 125 staff approved for 2013. The staffing changes comprise the establishment of five new positions (1 D-2 Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Political) and 4 National Professional Officers (Political Affairs Officer, Human Rights Officer, Security Sector Reform Officer and Public Information Officer)) as well as the abolishment of three positions (1 P-5 Senior Security Sector Reform Officer, 1 P-4 Political Affairs Officer and 1 P-3 Police Officer). In paragraph 67 of his report, the Secretary-General indicates that the proposed changes to the number and level of staffing positions are in line with the recommendations on revisions to the mandate and adjustment to the structure and strength of the mission. 129. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the establishment of the position of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Political) was expected to improve the management of UNIOGBIS and achieve greater coherence, coordination and efficiency within and among the different sections. It was further explained that, as a result of the political instability in the country, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General had had to dedicate more time and effort to resolving the political crisis and had therefore not been able to dedicate his full attention to managing the Office. The Committee was further informed that the new position would support the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in managerial issues, allowing him to focus his attention on key diplomatic functions and resource mobilization efforts in connection with the upcoming elections. 130. Upon further enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the existing position of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Development), which also functioned as Resident Coordinator, Resident Representative and Humanitarian Coordinator, would continue to play a central role in the coordination of United Nations operational activities for development and would lead the efforts in implementing the United Nations development and humanitarian mandate in the country and in ensuring the strategic coherence of the activities of the United Nations country team with the mandate of UNIOGBIS. Similarly, the Committee was informed that the Chief of Staff would continue to be responsible for the integrated management of all mission activities; provide guidance on policy and coordination; develop coherent communication structures and systems; interface between the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Chief of Mission Support on budget and human resources; oversee the work of the mission's Senior Strategic Planner; and advise the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on protocol matters. 131. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the proposals of the Secretary-General for the establishment of the new position of Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Political) at the D-2 level. 132. While taking note of the proposed establishment of four National Professional Officer positions, the Advisory Committee recalls that the technical assessment mission to Guinea-Bissau had recommended, inter alia, the establishment of eight positions of National Professional Officers within existing resources to strengthen the substantive components of the mission and the office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Political). During its consideration of the proposals of the Secretary-General, the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the mission had decided to establish the recommended positions in a phased manner, with four positions being proposed in 2014 and the remaining four proposed for 2015 after a reassessment of the mission's needs. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the proposal of the Secretary-General for the establishment of four new National Professional Officer positions. However, the Committee recommends that further explanation for the reasons justifying the phased approach in the establishment of the recommended positions be given to the General Assembly at the time of its consideration of the budget proposals of the Secretary-General. 133. Concerning the proposed abolishment of the Security Sector Reform Officer position (P-5) and the Police Officer position (P-3), the Secretary-General indicates in paragraph 67 of his report that the ECOWAS mission in Guinea-Bissau would handle much of the operational dimensions of security sector reform, and two seconded senior advisers to be funded through extrabudgetary resources would provide advisory support. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that two senior advisers would provide support to UNIOGBIS through strategic and technical advice to national authorities and relevant stakeholders, including ECOWAS and its mission in Guinea-Bissau, in implementing the national security sector reform and rule of law strategies and in developing a military justice system that is compliant with international standards. The Secretary-General further indicates that the abolishment of the Political Affairs Officer position (P-4) is proposed following the establishment of the four National Professional Officer positions and the reduced responsibilities following the proposed establishment of the new D-2 position. 134. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the proposal for the abolishment of the Political Affairs Officer position (P-4). However, the Committee calls into question the rationale for proposing the abolishment of the Senior Security Sector Reform Officer position (P-5) and the Police Officer position (P-3) in the Rule of Law and Security Institutions Service and their being substituted by two seconded senior advisers funded through extrabudgetary sources. It is the Committee's view that the ongoing substantive requirement for the fulfilment of these functions remains unchanged. Therefore, the Committee reiterates the view that such proposed abolishments cannot be considered sustainable efficiencies, but rather a simple shift in funding from the regular budget to extrabudgetary sources for the continued performance of mandated activities (A/68/7, para. 80). In that regard, the Committee recommends against the proposed abolishment of the two positions. 135. Subject to its comments in paragraph 113 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the resources proposed for UNIOGBIS for 2014. 136. In its resolution 2097 (2013), the Security Council extended the UNIPSIL mandate for a final period of 12 months, until 31 March 2014. During that period, the mission will fully draw down and progressively transfer its responsibilities to the United Nations country team, the Government and relevant national and international partners as part of its transition and exit plan. The Secretary-General proposes a staffing level of 41 positions for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2014, reflecting a reduction of 27 positions when compared with the 2013 level of 68 positions. He further indicates that after a further reduction of 18 positions, 23 positions will be maintained for the period until 31 May to complete the liquidation of the mission. Details of the proposed staffing changes are laid out in table 13 and paragraphs 93 and 94 of the report of the Secretary-General. 137. The estimated requirements for UNIPSIL for 2014 amount to $4,364,100 (which includes $1,346,400 for liquidation), compared with the appropriation of $12,393,200 for 2013. The decrease of $8,029,100 is attributable mainly to the abolishment of all civilian staff positions; the repatriation of Government-provided personnel; and the reduction in operational costs as a result of the full drawdown of the mission, offset in part by the increase in resources required for the actual physical closure and administrative liquidation of the mission. 138. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that planning for the United Nations country team in Sierra Leone to step up activities after the exit of UNIPSIL had already been factored into the Transitional Joint Vision covering the period 2013-2014, which provided a framework for United Nations programmes in support of the Government's second and third poverty reduction strategies. In addition, the Committee was informed that nearly two thirds of the funds requested to implement the Transitional Joint Vision ($141 million out of a total of $230 million) were already available. Upon further enquiry, the Committee was informed that three programme documents had been formulated to provide a strong basis for continued support to the Government during and after the transfer of responsibilities from UNIPSIL to the United Nations country team in the areas of constitutional review; security sector reform; and conflict prevention. The Committee was also informed that the transfer of assets to the United Nations country team was already in progress with the mission's field office in Kono being handed over to the United Nations country team in September 2013 and the office in Bo expected to be taken over by the World Food Programme after its closing in December 2013. Furthermore, the office premises in Makeni would be taken over by UNICEF after the closing of that office in December. 139. The Advisory Committee commends UNIPSIL for the efforts so far made to implement an orderly drawdown in collaboration with the United Nations country team. The Committee encourages other missions to draw lessons from the liquidation experience of UNIPSIL. 140. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the resources proposed for UNIPSIL for 2014. 141. The estimated requirements for the United Nations support for the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission for 2014 amount to $5,872,600, compared with the appropriation of $6,933,200 for 2013. The decrease of $1,060,600 is attributable mainly to the decrease under operational costs resulting from the change in the cost-sharing arrangement for a fixed-wing aircraft among the Commission, UNOWA and MINUSMA. The Secretary-General indicates in paragraph 123 of his report that the cost-sharing, which was based on a ratio of 25:75 between the Commission and UNOWA in 2013, will change to 10:65:25 among the Commission, UNOWA and MINUSMA in 2014, taking into account the anticipated use of the aircraft. In addition, the decrease reflects reduced requirements under consultants, owing mainly to the discontinuation of the Follow-up Committee under the terms set out in the Greentree Agreement, which were concluded in August 2013, releasing the Committee from monitoring respect for the rights of the Bakassi population. 142. During its consideration of the report of the Secretary-General, the Advisory Committee enquired about a provision of $16,600 for the acquisition of information technology equipment, including three 3D screens for computers, two projectors and one geographic information systems (GIS) server. The Committee was informed that the 3D screens were for desktop image processing in connection with the final mapping project and the construction of pillars at the border demarcation between Cameroon and Nigeria. It was further informed that the final mapping of the border involved the production of multi-scale map sheets covering its whole length, which required high resolution screens for image processing, special paper, new software licences and a dedicated server for GIS operations. 143. The Advisory Committee recommends an increase in the proposed vacancy rate for the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission for 2014 under international staff, from zero per cent to 5 per cent for the reasons indicated in paragraph 113 above. 144. Subject to its recommendation in paragraph 143 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the requested resources for the United Nations support to the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission for 2014. 145. The estimated requirements for the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia for 2014 amount to $2,962,400, which is the same level as the approved budget for 2013. The variance between the 2013 and 2014 requirements is attributable mainly to an anticipated increase in common staff costs for international staff, based on historical averages and taking into account the recruitment with effect from 1 October 2013 of a new staff member. The increase is offset by a reduction in operational costs, particularly in the areas of travel, information and communications technology, and other supplies, services and equipment, in line with the mission's efforts to contain costs. The projected overexpenditure for 2012-2013 is attributable mainly to higher common staff costs and higher-than-budgeted costs for the acquisition of accommodations and generator fuel. 146. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 148 of the report of the Secretary-General that fundraising is under way for the joint project entitled "Towards a comprehensive implementation of the Joint Plan of Action for Central Asia under the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy". The Secretary-General indicates that the project, which covers the period from February 2013 to February 2016, has an estimated total budget of $1,000,000. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that some $80,267 had been received from the Government of Norway and $30,000 from the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre. In addition, the Committee was informed that pledges in the amounts of $147,000 from the Government of Norway and $1,000,000 from the European Union had also been received. 147. The Advisory Committee recommends an increase in the proposed vacancy rate for the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia for 2014 under international staff, from zero per cent to 5 per cent for the reasons indicated in paragraph 113 above. 148. Subject to its recommendation in paragraph 147 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the requested resources for the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia for 2014. 149. The estimated requirements for BNUB for 2014 amount to $14,955,800, compared with the appropriation of $15,586,700 for 2013. The decrease of $630,900 for 2013 is attributable mainly to decreased requirements under civilian personnel costs attributable to the reclassification of one Field Service position to a National Professional Officer position and a reduction in post adjustment by 4.5 per cent; reduced salary costs for national staff owing to the depreciation of the Burundian franc; lower estimated costs for communications as a result of a reduction in the cost of leasing the transponder and a reduction in the number of rental towers and telephone extensions, as well as lower requirements for public information activities. 150. The proposed civilian staffing level for 2014 remains unchanged from the 2013 level, at 123 personnel, and reflects the reclassification of one Field Service position of Security Service Officer to National Professional Officer to reflect the reorganization of the Security Information Coordination Unit in the Security Section. 151. Upon enquiry, with regard to the future plans of the mission, the Advisory Committee was informed that a strategic assessment mission had been deployed to Burundi from 4 to 10 November 2013, with a view to providing the Secretary-General with recommendations on options for future United Nations engagement in Burundi. The Committee was further informed that the recommendations would take into account the views of the Government of Burundi, civil society and the international partners of the country. In addition, the mission would review the state of peace consolidation in Burundi, the implementation of the benchmarks, the national institutional capacities in addressing peace consolidation tasks and the operational presence of non-United Nations actors. Upon further enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that BNUB had prepared preliminary plans for the possible drawdown, transition and handover to the United Nations country team. The Advisory Committee welcomes the proactive approach taken by BNUB in preparation for the possible drawdown and handover of activities to the United Nations country team. 152. The Advisory Committee recommends an increase in the proposed vacancy rate for BNUB for 2014 under international staff, from 5 per cent to 8 per cent, under national staff (Local level), from 3 per cent to 4 per cent, and under United Nations Volunteers, from zero per cent to 20 per cent, for the reasons indicated in paragraph 113 above. 153. Subject to its recommendation in paragraph 152 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the requested resources for BNUB for 2014. 154. The estimated requirements for UNSCOL for 2014 amount to $8,750,600, compared with the appropriation of $9,042,900 for 2013. The decrease of $292,300 for 2014 is attributable mainly to reduced requirements under operational costs as a result of using a fibre-optic link to Valencia, Spain, as well as reduced requirements for facilities and infrastructure resulting from fewer acquisitions; and a reduction in the mission's vehicle fleet. The decrease is offset in part by increased civilian personnel costs due to an increase in the average step level budgeted for salaries at the Professional and higher categories and Field Service level, offset by the conversion of one P-5 position to the P-4 level. 155. The proposed civilian staffing level for 2014 remains unchanged from the 2013 level of 83 personnel and reflects the conversion of one P-5 position of Senior Administrative Officer to a P-4 position of Administrative Officer based on the determination, subsequent to an internal review of mission support functions, that a P-4 Administrative Officer can effectively carry out the tasks required of the function. 156. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the requested resources for UNSCOL for 2014. United Nations Office for Central Africa 157. The estimated requirements for UNOCA for 2014 amount to $6,060,300, compared with the appropriation of $6,235,400 for 2013. The reduced requirements for 2014 of $175,100 are attributable mainly to the lower operational costs arising from reduced requirements for facilities and infrastructure. The projected unencumbered balance of $968,000 for 2013 is attributable mainly to the underexpenditure under international staff costs, owing to the higher vacancy rate of 10 per cent compared with the budgeted rate of 5 per cent. 158. The Advisory Committee recommends an increase in the proposed vacancy rate for UNOCA for 2014 under international staff, from 5 to 12 per cent and under national staff (Local level), from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, for the reasons indicated in paragraph 113 above. 159. Subject to its recommendation in paragraph 158 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the requested resources for UNOCA for 2014. 160. The estimated requirements for UNSMIL for 2014 amount to $47,282,300, compared with the appropriation of $46,643,700 for 2013. The increased requirements for 2014 of $638,600 are attributable mainly to an increase in civilian personnel costs driven by a lower budgeted vacancy rate for international staff of 6 per cent, compared with 15 per cent in 2013, and an increase in the percentage of common staff costs for international staff based on historical expenditure trends. This increase is offset in part by reduced requirements for operational expenditures, mainly under facilities and infrastructure, owing to the relocation of staff accommodations and offices to a new, security-cleared compound. 161. The proposed staffing complement of 286 personnel reflects a net decrease of 2 positions when compared with the 2013 level of 288 positions. The staffing changes proposed by the Secretary-General comprise the establishment of three positions (1 P-4 Public Information Officer; 1 P-4 Political Affairs Officer/Head of Sabha Office; and 1 P-3 Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Officer); the abolishment of five positions (1 D-2, 1 P-5, 1 P-3, 1 National Professional Officer and 1 Local level); and the reclassification of one P-3 position to the P-2 level and one P-3 position to the Field Service category. 162. According to the supplementary information to the report of the Secretary-General, the proposed new position of Public Information Officer (P-4) would support a more proactive and assertive approach to media engagement by the Mission in response to specific requests from the Government of Libya. Similarly, the new position of Political Affairs Officer/Head of the Sabha Office would serve to enhance the profile of the Sabha Office and provide additional capacity for the Mission to effectively address issues that are specific to the south of the country. Finally, the new position of Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Officer (P-3) is proposed to work on the development and implementation of civilian reintegration programmes, to organize assessment missions in-country, and to assist in coordinating international assistance through the organization of regular coordination meetings. The Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Officer will also assist efforts aimed at supporting a national dialogue with armed groups and at strengthening the newly established national coordination mechanism. 163. Upon enquiry, in respect of the proposed abolishment of five positions in the Electoral Assistance Service, the Advisory Committee was informed that, with the increased capacity of the High National Election Commission of Libya, which was established in 2012, the requirement for electoral assistance had continued to decrease. In that regard, the Committee was also informed that the proposal to abolish the P-5 position of Senior Procedures Adviser had been based on the determination that the development of major electoral procedures and regulations would have been completed by the end of 2013 and that such assistance would no longer be needed in 2014. Similarly, the Committee was informed that the proposal to abolish the P-3 Electoral Affairs position in Benghazi had been based on the increased capacity of the High National Election Commission and the deteriorating security environment. 164. As indicated in paragraph 161 above, the Secretary-General proposes the downward reclassification of a position of Political Affairs Officer based in Tripoli from the P-3 to the P-2 level. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the proposal stemmed from the nature of the duties to be performed and had been made in consultation with the Office of the Prime Minister, where the position was located. The Committee was further informed that the duties of the position mainly involved gathering and processing information and serving as a conduit for strategic advice from more senior colleagues. 165. In its earlier report (A/67/604, paras. 168 and 169), the Advisory Committee took note of the apparent top-heavy staffing structure of the Mission and questioned the criteria that had been applied in the classification of the Mission's positions at the level of D-1 and above. The Committee expressed the view that standard criteria should be applied to the classification of UNSMIL positions. In that regard, the Advisory Committee reiterates the view that further steps need to be taken to align its staffing structure with that of similar missions. 166. The Advisory Committee recommends an increase in the proposed vacancy rate for UNSMIL for 2014 under international staff (Libya), from 6 per cent to 8 per cent, under national Professional Officers (Libya), from 15 per cent to 30 per cent, and under national staff (Local level), from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, for the reasons indicated in paragraph 113 above. 167. Subject to its recommendations in paragraph 166 above, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of the requested resources for UNSMIL for 2014. D. United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 168. The Advisory Committee recalls that the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1401 (2002) for an initial period of 12 months. The mandate of the Mission was subsequently extended by the Security Council in its resolutions 1471 (2003), 1536 (2004), 1589 (2005), 1662 (2006), 1746 (2007), 1806 (2008), 1868 (2009), 1917 (2010), 1974 (2011) and 2041 (2012). Pursuant to its resolution 2096 (2013), the Council decided to extend the mandate of UNAMA until 19 March 2014. Resource utilization in the 2012-2013 biennium 169. The Mission projects full utilization of the appropriation of $437,264,900 for the 2012-2013 biennium. The projected overexpenditure under civilian personnel costs of $25,818,900, or 18.9 per cent, will be offset by projected underexpenditure of $927,100, or 37.2 per cent, under military and police costs, and of $24,891,800, or 12.5 per cent, under operational costs. 170. The overexpenditure under civilian personnel costs is due to increased requirements under: (a) national staff, resulting from salary increases, a lower-than-budgeted actual average vacancy rate and increases in common staff costs, based on actual expenditure trends; (b) international staff, resulting from a lower-than-budgeted vacancy rate, increases in common staff costs, increases in post adjustment, the increased rate for danger pay allowance and the inclusion of non-family duty station hardship allowance; and (c) United Nations Volunteers, resulting from an increased rate for the provision for danger pay allowance (see A/68/327/Add.4, para. 38). 171. The underexpenditure under military and police personnel costs is due mainly to: (a) lower-than-budgeted deployment of military advisers in 2012 to implement a temporary ceiling imposed due to the prevailing security situation in the country; and (b) lower-than-anticipated deployment of United Nations police in 2012 and 2013. 172. The underexpenditure under operational costs is attributable to, inter alia, the following factors: (a) Under air transportation ($15,036,400, or 16.3 per cent), the reduced utilization of the Mission's air fleet, which in turn resulted in lower rental and operation charges, services, ground handling charges and a reduced consumption of fuel; (b) Under facilities and infrastructure ($4,671,500, or 6.5 per cent), the decreased acquisition of security and safety equipment, revised specifications for fire system and sewage treatment plant, fewer international armed guards actually deployed in view of the closure of six provincial offices and lower-than-budgeted cost of rental of premises in 2012, resulting from the closure of six provincial offices; (c) Under communications ($3,103,600, or 22.7 per cent), reduced requirements for the acquisition and maintenance of a Global Positioning System (GPS) vehicle-tracking service and reduced transponder charges and requirements for the acquisition of UHF digital trunking radios, in part due to the closure of several field offices in 2012 and 2013; (d) Reduced requirements under other supplies, services and equipment ($1,026,300, or 18.7 per cent); (e) Under official travel ($788,500, or 19 per cent), the reduced number of trips undertaken by staff for non-training purposes within the Mission area in view of the early closure of various field offices in 2012 and 2013 and the reduced number of staff attending training-related activities outside the Mission area, resulting from an increased number of training activities being conducted in-house or within the Mission area. Proposed requirements for 2014 173. The estimated requirements for UNAMA for 2014 amount to $191,364,500 before recosting, representing a net decrease of $4,866,900, or 2.5 per cent, compared with the appropriation of $196,231,400 for 2013 (see A/68/327/Add.4, table 1). 174. It is indicated in the report that, during 2013, there has been an increased effort to promote and consolidate progress on the political and socioeconomic and security transitions, which will culminate in 2014 (A/68/327/Add.4, para. 3). In accordance with the priorities set out in Security Council resolution 2096 (2013), UNAMA and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan, within their mandate and guided by the principle of reinforcing Afghan sovereignty, ownership and leadership, will continue to lead and coordinate the international civilian efforts, in accordance with the communiqués of the London and Kabul Conferences and the conclusions of the Bonn Conference, with a particular focus on the following priorities for 2014, as set out in paragraph 15 of the report of the Secretary-General: (a) Provide good offices and support to inclusive Afghan-led political processes; promote Afghan institutions' role in implementing all aspects necessary for credible elections, including strengthening of technical preparations and encouraging coherent international donor support, at the request of the Government; provide support to intra-Afghan dialogue, including High Peace Council initiatives with civil society and political opposition at the provincial, national and regional levels to support the advancement of a framework for national negotiations; support regular and structured bilateral and multilateral political dialogue between Afghanistan and neighbouring countries, particularly linked to the agreed Istanbul Process "Heart of Asia" confidence-building measures, to address regional cooperation issues; (b) Continue to promote human rights; support accountability towards and the implementation of fundamental human rights provisions of the Afghan Constitution, as well as national and international law for all Afghan citizens, especially with regard to the rights of women and children linked to Security Council resolutions; advocate with all parties to the conflict for the protection of civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law and monitor the situation; (c) Promote inclusive and coherent socioeconomic development policies to achieve a self-sustaining sovereign state and reduce poverty; as the co-chair of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board, advocate for predictable and balanced financial commitments and related commitments, as set out in the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework, of the Government and international partners; facilitate and help coordinate partnerships, including within the United Nations system, to enable capacity development that establishes legitimate and accountable institutions at both national and provincial levels. 175. According to the Secretary-General, subsequent to the extension of the Mission's mandate by the Security Council under its resolution 2096 (2013), UNAMA has identified a number of opportunities to strategically realign its human and financial resources to the current political environment, development priorities, human rights issues and security conditions. The proposed realignment seeks to streamline functions to increase coherence within the Mission during the transition phase, achieve efficiencies in the delivery of its mandate, avoid duplication, build synergies with United Nations specialized agencies, funds and programmes and reduce the exposure of UNAMA staff to security threats. In this context, the Secretary-General proposes to: (a) Scale down the number of Mission staff and offices in substantive and support areas in Kabul and Kuwait (A/68/327/Add.4, para. 19 (a)); (b) Restructure the Mission's field presence in Afghanistan, including the reclassification of the regional office in Bamyan to a provincial office, the closure of the provincial office in Khost and scaling down the staff of the remaining seven regional and six provincial offices (ibid., para. 19 (b)); (c) Merge the current functions of the Child Protection Unit and the Gender Unit under the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General/ Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator into the Human Rights Unit under the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan (ibid., para. 19 (c)); (d) Merge field coordination functions into the Office of the Director of Civil Affairs and Development, following the abolishment of the Field Coordination Unit as a separate unit under the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator) (ibid., para. 19 (d)). 176. The Advisory Committee was informed that UNAMA sought to ensure a set of achievable results in its budget for 2014, based on the following guiding principles: (a) consolidation through streamlining structures and resources; (b) optimization, by aligning resources and support costs to retain the Mission's outreach capabilities; and (c) ensuring staff security by assessing the Mission's ability to implement the security support required to operate within a volatile context. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the reductions in resources in recent years have had a particular impact on the Mission's permanent field presence, and that the Mission's geographic reach is critical to the delivery of mandated tasks and activities related to monitoring processes and to the provision of assistance to authorities at the subnational level, including on socioeconomic development. The Committee was further informed that 10 field offices have already been closed, resulting in an increased need to ensure that the Mission is able to maintain ongoing outreach to areas where it has no permanent presence, which requires pre-positioned vehicles and air transport networks, with an increasing reliance on the latter, given security conditions. 177. The Advisory Committee reiterates its position that effective and efficient mandate delivery must always be the overriding factor in determining the Secretariat's resource requirements and its overall staffing structure (A/68/7, para. 19). The Committee recalls its previous recommendations on the impact of reductions on the UNAMA budget (see A/67/604, para. 206), as well as paragraph 15 of General Assembly resolution 67/248, and it expects that the Secretary-General will take all necessary measures to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the quality and timeliness of the delivery of all mandated programmes and activities. Upon enquiry, the Committee was provided with a list of efficiency measures implemented under the programme support component to reduce the budgetary requirements in 2014 (see annex). Security 178. According to the Secretary-General, the security environment in 2014 is expected to remain volatile and attempts to influence, distort and disrupt the transition process, including the work of the United Nations as an impartial actor, will continue (see A/68/327/Add.4, para. 22). The Advisory Committee notes that no revision to the staffing of the Security Section has been proposed for 2014, however, the amount of $11,177,600 proposed for security services under facilities and infrastructure in 2014 reflects an increase of $1.1 million, compared to 2013. The proposed resource requirements for security services include the UNAMA share of the cost of the Afghan Protection Services deployed to secure various United Nations compounds in Kabul and throughout the region ($1,718,300); deployment of international armed guards in Kabul and the field offices ($7,405,100); road missions, including meal allowance for armed escorts, the quick-reaction force and rental of escort vehicles from local vendors ($1,163,200); and canine services, including dogs and dog handlers ($588,900). The budgetary requirements for security in 2014 are summarized in annex II of the Secretary-General's report. 179. It is indicated in the report that the UNAMA security management team, led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, as the designated official, and comprising the Mission, the Department of Safety and Security and the United Nations specialized agencies, funds and programmes, addresses issues of common security management and services (A/68/327/Add.4, para. 12). Despite the United Nations assessment of the security situation, which has indicated deterioration in terms of the number of violent incidents recorded, the transition to Afghan responsibility for security by 2014 has remained on target. The volatility and uncertainty associated with the overall transition process will continue to affect the Mission's ability to engage with its counterparts, especially at the provincial level (ibid., para. 28). According to the Secretary-General, UNAMA will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure the security of its staff and its assets throughout the country and, in conjunction with the United Nations country team and with Headquarters in New York, will continue to implement a broad range of security measures with a view to developing appropriate risk mitigation strategies, in compliance with the minimum operating security standards/residential security standards applicable to the United Nations engagement in Afghanistan as well as to support the process of planning for the Mission's future security strategies (ibid., para 24). The Advisory Committee notes the actions taken by UNAMA in anticipation of the security transition in Afghanistan in 2014 and, taking into account General Assembly resolution 65/259, encourages the Mission to strengthen cooperation with the host Government to ensure the safety and security of United Nations staff, operations and premises. 180. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the additional international armed guards would be deployed in Kabul and in the field offices where the security situation is already volatile or becoming so, and that the requirement reflects the increased number of international armed guards, an increase in their remuneration and a new requirement for a country director, who would be responsible for the administration of the international armed guards. The Committee was informed, upon further enquiry, that the international armed guards in UNAMA are in fact contractual personnel of private security firms providing services to the United Nations. The Committee recalls that, in its report on the use of private security, it had recommended that the relevant committees of the General Assembly consider the United Nations policy on the use of armed private security companies (A/67/624, para. 25), and also recalls section V of General Assembly resolution 67/254 A, in which the Assembly stressed the importance of ensuring that all measures necessary are taken to avoid legal and reputational risks for the Organization in using armed security services of private security companies. In the same resolution, the Assembly further requested the Secretary-General to provide clarification on the operational criteria for when the use of armed security services from private security companies could be appropriate for United Nations operations at Headquarters and field locations and to report thereon in the relevant reports to the General Assembly. The Committee recommends that the Assembly request the Secretary-General to provide information on the use of private security companies in all future budgets for special political missions. Furthermore, in light of the fact that the name "United Nations guards" is used to refer to personnel provided by police- and troop-contributing countries, the Committee believes that it is not appropriate to use the term "international armed guards" to refer to private security personnel. In this connection, the Committee expects the Secretary-General to clearly distinguish in all budgetary proposals between requirements for the armed guards provided by police- and troop-contributing countries and those obtained from private security companies, as appropriate (see also the comments of the Committee on the use of United Nations guards in special political missions in section III above). 181. The estimated requirements for military and police personnel for 2014 of $971,400 reflect a decrease of $223,500, or 18.7 per cent, compared with the apportionment of $1,194,900 for 2013. The variance reflects mainly the proposed reduced strength of military advisers from 20 in 2013 to 15 in 2014, and the proposed reduced strength of United Nations police from 10 in 2013 to 6 in 2014. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the actual vacancy rate as at 30 September 2013 for military personnel was less than 1 per cent and for United Nations police was 42 per cent. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the resources proposed for military and police personnel for 2014. 182. The estimated requirements for civilian personnel for 2014 of $113,920,000 reflect an increase of $2,196,600, or 2 per cent, compared with the apportionment of $111,723,400 for 2013. The increased requirements are due mainly to: (a) changes in the standard costs for salaries for national staff effective 1 March 2013; (b) the application of vacancy rates of 6 per cent for National Professional Officers and 4 per cent for Local level staff deployed to all Mission locations, compared with the budgeted rates for 2013 of 13 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively; (c) increases in common staff costs, in view of a change in the applicable parameter for the calculation of common staff costs, reflecting the application of 35 per cent over the net salary compared with the current budgeted rate of 25 per cent; and (d) increases in danger pay allowance, with effect from 1 January 2013, from $448 to $538. 183. The proposed staffing for 2014 consists of 1,691 positions, comprising 402 international staff (226 Professional and 176 Field Service), 1,209 national staff (187 National Professional Officers and 1,022 Local level staff) and 80 United Nations Volunteers, reflecting a decrease of 241 positions as compared to the approved staffing levels for 2013. The proposed staffing changes include the abolishment of 242 positions, the redeployment of 52 positions and the establishment of 1 new National Professional Officer position (see paras. 28-30 below). The Secretary-General provides a summary of the proposed staffing changes in table 2 of his report, while tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 provide details on, respectively, the proposed staffing requirements by location, proposed abolishment of approved positions, proposed redeployment of approved positions and proposed reclassification of approved positions. 184. Table 19 below provides a summary of the approved staffing of the Mission in 2013 and the staffing proposals of the Secretary-General for 2014. Table 19 UNAMA: proposed staffing requirements Approved positions for 2013 1 USG, 2 ASG, 3 D-2, 6 D-1, 30 P-5, 93 P-4, 83 P-3, 38 P-2, 191 FS, 213 NPO, 1,192 LL, 80 UNV Proposed positions for 2014 1 USG, 2 ASG, 3 D-2, 6 D-1, 28 P-5, 80 P-4, 80 P-3, 26 P-2, 176 FS, 187 NPO, 1,022 LL, 80 UNV Proposed new positions 1 NPO Proposed reclassifications 1 P-4 to P-5, 1 P-3 to P-2 and 3 P-4 to P-3 Proposed redeployments 2 P-4, 4 P-3, 1 P-2, 2 FS, 6 NPO, 33 LL, 4 UNV Proposed abolishments 3 P-5, 9 P-4, 5 P-3, 13 P-2, 15 FS, 28 NPO and 169 LL Abbreviations: USG, Under-Secretary-General; ASG, Assistant Secretary-General; FS, Field Service; LL, Local level; NPO, National Professional Officer; UNV, United Nations Volunteers. 185. The UNAMA budget for 2014 is based on vacancy rates of 7 per cent for international personnel, 6 per cent for National Professional Officers, 4 per cent for Local level staff and 11 per cent for United Nations Volunteers. According to the Secretary-General, the downward revision of the budgeted vacancy rate for international staff from 12 per cent in 2013 to 7 per cent in 2014 is facilitated by the proposed closure of a provincial office in Khost; the proposed reclassification of the regional office in Bamyan to the provincial structure, including a reduction in its staffing levels; as well as the proposed rationalization of the Mission's substantive operations, which would result in the proposed abolishment of 45 international positions. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the actual vacancy rates for Mission personnel as at 30 September 2013 was 14.3 per cent for international staff, 4.1 per cent combined for national staff and 16.3 per cent for United Nations Volunteers. Concerning the proposed vacancy rate for United Nations Volunteers of 11 per cent, the Committee was informed that the recruitment of several United Nations Volunteers is in an advanced stage, which would reduce the actual vacancy rate to 6.3 per cent by the end of 2013. 186. The Advisory Committee was informed that UNAMA is better able to manage vacancies of international positions now that Inspira is operational. In this regard, while the Mission has executed several recruitment actions both from the Inspira roster and from Mission-specific exercises, it has found that many candidates on the roster do not accept offers made by UNAMA. Abolishments 187. In paragraph 45 of his report (A/68/327/Add.4), the Secretary-General indicates that a total of 242 positions are proposed to be abolished, comprising 45 international positions (3 P-5, 9 P-4, 5 P-3, 13 P-2 and 15 Field Service) and 197 national positions (28 National Professional Officers and 169 Local level). The Advisory Committee has no objection to the Secretary-General's proposals for abolishments of positions. Redeployments 188. It is proposed that 52 positions be redeployed among several Mission locations throughout Afghanistan and in the Kuwait Office, as detailed in table 5 of the report of the Secretary-General, comprising: (a) nine international positions (7 Professional and 2 Field Service); (b) 39 national positions (6 National Professional Officers and 33 Local level); and (c) 4 United Nations Volunteers. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the Secretary-General's proposals for the redeployment of positions. 189. It is proposed that six positions be reclassified, including five international and one national position: (a) one P-3 position to the P-2 level for an Associate Coordination Officer in the Civil Affairs Unit; (b) three P-4 positions to the P-3 level, for one Civil Affairs Officer and two Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Officers for the regional offices in Kandahar, Herat and Jalalabad; (c) one P-4 position to the P-5 level, for Chief of the Conduct and Discipline Unit; and (d) one Local level position to the National Professional Officer level, for a Conduct and Discipline Officer in Kuwait. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the Secretary-General's proposals for the reclassification of positions. Regional and provincial offices 190. Details on the proposed staffing requirements for the UNAMA regional and provincial offices that will remain operational in 2014 are provided in tables 10 and 11 and in paragraphs 153 to 178 of the report of the Secretary-General. UNAMA is proposing to reduce the staffing of the regional and provincial offices by a total of 173 positions (1 P-5, 8 P-4, 11 P-2, 7 Field Service, 27 NPO and 119 LL), compared to 2013. In line with Afghanistan's transition process, and taking into account the prevailing security situation in the country, the Mission closed nine provincial offices in 2012, and currently operates eight regional and six provincial offices throughout Afghanistan (A/68/327/Add.4, para. 19 (b)). According to the Secretary-General, the closure of the provincial office in Khost and the reclassification of the existing regional office in Bamyan as a provincial office would align the UNAMA field presence and coordination structures with those of the United Nations specialized agencies, funds and programmes. The Mission's physical presence in the field would therefore be maintained with seven regional and six provincial offices in 2014 (ibid., para. 19 (b)). 191. The Advisory Committee notes that regional and provincial offices of UNAMA are headed at the D-1, P-5 and P-4 levels. It is proposed that the UNAMA regional and provincial offices in Kabul, Herat, Balkh (Mazar-e-Sharif), Nangharhar, Kunduz and Paktya (Gardez) be headed at the P-5 level, while the UNAMA presence in Jawzjan and Bamyan be headed at the P-4 level. The Committee notes that while it is proposed that the Kandahar office continue to be headed at the D-1 level, the staffing of the office is to be reduced by 11 positions, from 90 in 2013 to 79 in 2014. The Committee recommends that the General Assembly request UNAMA to review the structure of regional and provincial offices with the aim of harmonizing the levels of the heads of regional and provincial offices in accordance with the relevant internal guidance on organizational nomenclature, and to report thereon in the context of the 2015 budget submission. 192. The Advisory Committee further considers that the reduction in the field presence of UNAMA, as well as the proposed abolishment of 242 positions in 2014, has affected continuing requirements for high-level positions in both the substantive and support components of the Mission, and it expects that the budget for 2015 will reflect the review of the levels of senior positions and any necessary adjustments to the staffing table. Conduct and Discipline Team 193. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, in an effort to strengthen the conduct and discipline functions in the region, the conduct and discipline functions in UNAMA and the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) would be integrated. The proposed new Conduct and Discipline Team is to comprise four positions, including a Chief of Conduct and Discipline (P-5), two National Professional Officers and one Administrative Assistant (Local level). The Committee notes that previously, there were one P-4, one P-2 and one Local level position under the UNAMA budget, and one P-5 position under the UNAMI budget. Under the integrated structure, the Chief of Conduct and Discipline Team will oversee the overall conduct and discipline services in the two Missions, assisted by the National Professional Officers. In view of its larger size, UNAMA will lead under the integrated structure, within which it is proposed that: the current Conduct and Discipline Officer position (P-4) be reclassified to the P-5 level to carry out duties as Chief, Conduct and Discipline Unit; and that one Local level position be reclassified to the National Professional Officer level. The integrated Conduct and Discipline Team would comprise one P-5 position and one National Professional Officer position financed by the UNAMA budget, and one National Professional Officer position and one Local level position financed by the UNAMI budget (see sect. IV.E below). The Committee was informed that the Chief of the Conduct and Discipline Team would be at a level similar to that of other field missions and commensurate to the level of expertise needed to provide the required support under the proposed integrated structure. 194. The Advisory Committee was also informed that the Conduct and Discipline Team would also oversee support on conduct and discipline issues for the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), previously carried out by UNAMA, as well as for the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. The Committee welcomes the efficiencies and savings derived from the proposed consolidation of the conduct and discipline units of UNAMI and UNAMA. Resident Auditor Unit 195. According to the Secretary-General, in line with a reorganization and streamlining of the Mission's auditing function, it is proposed that: (a) three positions (1 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 Field Service) continue to be deployed to the UNAMA Support Office in Kuwait; (b) two Local level positions (Administrative Assistants) be abolished in the Unit's office in Kuwait in view of the reduced level of administrative tasks required for the Unit in Kuwait as much of the administrative support to the auditing function for UNAMA is centralized at Headquarters in New York; and (c) one National Professional Officer be established to carry out duties as Auditor, to be deployed to headquarters in Kabul. It is indicated in the report that audit planning activities are required to be conducted in/from Mission headquarters in Kabul, including reviewing relevant supporting documents and holding discussions with management, which are expected to contribute to making the audit planning process for the Mission more efficient and providing adequate support to the audit team in Kuwait (see A/68/327/Add.4, para. 75). 196. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the UNAMA Resident Auditor Unit in Kuwait is responsible for implementing the audit work plan, providing ongoing independent advice to Mission management and ensuring adequate assessment of the effectiveness of its governance, risk management and control processes. The Resident Auditor Unit, established in 2004, falls under the oversight of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, and its field work includes frequent visits to the UNAMA regional and provincial offices. The Committee was further informed that the UNAMA Resident Auditor Unit had been moved to Kuwait in 2013, mainly in view of the security situation in the country and the establishment of the Kuwait Joint Support Office. The Committee was informed that, while the establishment of the Kuwait Joint Support Office has resulted in an increase in the audit activities undertaken in Kuwait, it is also necessary to have an Auditor position based in Kabul to expedite the audit process through gathering relevant audit evidence and conducting meetings with programme managers. The Committee was informed that, although some support and administrative functions are centralized in Kuwait, most of the audit assignments conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services in 2013 continued to involve travel to Afghanistan. 197. The Advisory Committee notes that the number of resident auditors in UNAMA is proposed to be increased while the Mission continues to reduce its staffing in Afghanistan overall. The Committee recognizes the need for the presence of a resident auditor in Kabul, and recommends approval of the proposed new position at the National Professional Officer level for resident auditor in Kabul; however, it considers that the new position in Kabul should result in a reduced requirement for the resident auditor capacity in Kuwait. The Committee therefore expects that a commensurate reduction in resident auditor staffing in Kuwait will be reflected in the UNAMA proposed budget for 2015. 198. The Advisory Committee also recalls its previous comments on the Kuwait Joint Support Office (see A/66/7/Add.12, paras. 204-207), and it recommends that the Secretary-General be requested to examine the optimal location for the resident auditors to best serve the missions in the region and to report thereon in the context of the 2015 budget for special political missions (see the comments and recommendations of the Committee on the Kuwait Joint Support Office in section III above). 199. Taking into account its recommendations contained in the present report, the Advisory Committee has no objection to the proposals of the Secretary-General with regard to staffing. 200. The requirements for operational costs are estimated at $76,473,100, representing a decrease of $6,840,000, or 8.2 per cent, in comparison with the appropriation of $83,313,100 for 2013. Detailed information on the requirements under each category of expenditure is provided in section IV.C of the report. 201. Key variances between the requirements for 2014 and the apportionment for 2013 include reductions in the following: (a) the discontinuation of weekly shuttle flights to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and the proposed reduction of one fixed-wing aircraft from the fleet; (b) the completion of the Mission's upgrade project in 2012, and other decreased resource requirements for information and communications technology; (c) the reduced engagement of consultants for the provision of technical and specialized expertise as is it planned to use more in-house or regional expertise for consultancies; and (d) decreased requirements for official travel of staff within the Mission area for non-training activities, resulting from the increased and frequent use of information and communications technology tools available inhouse, and for travel of staff for training, owing to the fact that an increasing number of training sessions are being held in-house and within the Mission area. 202. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the Secretary-General's proposals for operational costs. Country team coordination 203. Information on partnerships, country team coordination and mission integration is provided in paragraphs 9 to 14 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/327/Add.4). Annex III of the Secretary-General's report provides information on specific substantive project activities planned to be carried out by UNAMA in conjunction with United Nations agencies, funds and programmes. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for 2015-2019 is currently being outlined, following the common country assessment process, and that the identified priority areas include equitable economic development; basic social services; social equity and investment in human capital; justice and rule of law; and accountable governance. 204. The Advisory Committee was also informed that the country team and the Mission have in place a coherence strategy for 2012-2014, which has been designed to respond to the Government's expectation that the United Nations system will be "Delivering as One" during the transition period and beyond. Through support of the Resident Coordinator's Office, this strategy provides the basis for the implementation of a set of shared programmatic priorities, business and operational plans and a common communication strategy for the United Nations. 205. The Advisory Committee was informed that the country team holds regular joint meetings with Government counterparts, at which issues related to coherent support and alignment of programmes are discussed. The country team forum, chaired by the UNAMA Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General/ Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator, comprising the heads of agencies, funds and programmes, serves as the principal coordination mechanism for the United Nations in Afghanistan. The forum is, in turn, supported by a number of working groups, including the Programme Management Team, the Operations Management Team and the Communications Working Group. In accordance with the Secretary-General's policy decisions on integration, a strategic policy group, comprised of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and a number of senior managers from the Mission and the country team, acts as a steering committee on issues related to United Nations system integration. 206. The Advisory Committee stresses the importance of the effective coordination of United Nations activities in Afghanistan to the implementation of the UNAMA mandate, and it welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Mission to improve coordination with the United Nations country team. The Committee encourages the Mission to continue its active engagement with the country team to ensure that effective executive coordination mechanisms are in place to effectively implement the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) process and to report on progress made in this regard in the context of the 2015 budget submission. Parallel civil service 207. According to the report, the articulation of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) process for 2015-2019 will form the basis of discussions in 2014 to advance coherent approaches by the United Nations system in line with both the Government's national priorities and established United Nations principles for development and humanitarian aid. These approaches include addressing Afghan concerns about a "second civil service" and working in ways not perceived as competing with the Government for service delivery and international funding (see A/68/327/Add.4, para. 17). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the second civil service, also referred to as the parallel civil service, refers to a significant number of highly skilled positions embedded in the ministries which are outside of the regular civil servants pay and grade scales. These positions have been established to increase the Government's institutional capacity and are paid by donors directly through their own programmes in support of ministries and/or through programmes of United Nations agencies and the World Bank. However, as these personnel are not part of the regular budget process of the Government, there have been concerns raised by the Government, the United Nations and various donors about the fiscal sustainability of the approach. The Committee was informed that UNAMA, through its coordinating functions with both United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and international donors, has supported the efforts of the Government to harmonize the salary and service conditions with the regular civil servants, which has resulted in reaching an agreement within the United Nations system on a set of steps to phase in the required changes to resolve this issue over the next three years. The Committee welcomes the efforts of UNAMA, in coordination with the country team, to support the efforts of the Government to harmonize the salary and service conditions of the parallel civil service with the regular civil service. E. United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq 208. The Advisory Committee has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (A/68/327/Add.5). The Committee recalls that, in its resolution 1500 (2003), the Security Council established the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) to support the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Iraq in the implementation of his mandate and that, in its resolution 1546 (2004), the Council affirmed that the United Nations should play a leading role in assisting the people and Government of Iraq in the formation of democratic norms and institutions for a representative government. The mandate of UNAMI was updated and expanded by the Council in resolution 1770 (2007) and renewed in resolutions 1830 (2008), 1883 (2009), 1936 (2010), 2001 (2011), 2061 (2012) and, most recently, 2110 (2013), by which the Council decided to renew the mandate until 31 July 2014. Resource utilization in the biennium 2012-2013 209. The Mission projects full utilization of the appropriation of $314,078,800 for the biennium 2012-2013. The projected overexpenditure under civilian personnel costs of $25,359,300, or 16.9 per cent, will be offset by projected underexpenditures of $4,177,100, or 14 per cent, under military and police costs, and of $21,182,200, or 15.8 per cent, under operational costs. 210. The overexpenditure under civilian personnel costs is attributable to increased requirements for: (a) International staff, attributable to a lower actual vacancy rate of 15 per cent, compared with the budgeted rate of 20 per cent in 2012, and a projected vacancy rate of 9 per cent, compared with the budgeted rate of 10 per cent for 2013; higher expenditures for common staff costs associated with the installation of additional staff members in Iraq during 2012-2013; an increase in the rate for danger pay allowance in all eligible locations in Iraq from the budgeted rate of $1,365 to $1,600 in 2012; and a higher-than-budgeted post adjustment rate of 46.6 per cent in 2012 and 2013, compared with a budgeted rate of 45 per cent in 2012; (b) National staff, attributable mainly to the lower actual vacancy rate of 15 per cent, compared with the budgeted rate of 35 per cent, for National Professional Officers in 2012; the lower actual vacancy rate of 13 per cent, compared with the budgeted rate of 20 per cent, for Local level staff in 2013, and to the increase in the rate of danger pay to $585 as of January 2013, compared with the budgeted rate in 2013 of $440 for National Professional Officers and $406 for Local level staff. 211. The underexpenditure under military and police personnel costs is the net result of projected unencumbered balances of (a) $44,100, or 3.1 per cent, under the apportionment for military observers, attributable mainly to unspent balances projected under death and disability since no such payment was required or is anticipated during the period; (b) $4,011,500, or 14.6 per cent, under the apportionment for military contingents, owing to actual average deployment for 2012 of 351 guards against the authorized strength of 428 owing to delayed deployment to Basra and Kirkuk, and actual average deployment for 2013 of 266 guards against the budgeted strength of 272, owing to delayed deployment to Kirkuk, thereby resulting in lower-than-budgeted expenditures for standard troop cost reimbursement and travel on emplacement, rotation and repatriation; and (c) $121,500, or 13.8 per cent, under United Nations police, attributable to lower-than-budgeted expenditures for mission subsistence allowance due to average deployment of four Police Advisers, compared with the budgeted deployment of five Police Advisers in 2013. 212. The underexpenditure under operational costs is attributable to the following factors, inter alia: (a) Under other supplies, services and equipment ($9,907,500, or 31 per cent), projected lower expenditures under rations, with actual rates that are lower than those budgeted; projected lower expenditures for freight-related costs, as more vendors were willing to deliver goods into Iraq; and projected lower expenditures for training fees, as a result of fewer new staff requiring security induction awareness training, offset in part by higher-than-budgeted costs for maintenance, cleaning, septic tank and garbage collection services for UNAMI locations within Iraq, combined with the acquisition of non-budgeted fuel storage tanks for Erbil and Baghdad (ibid., para. 320); (b) Under facilities and infrastructure ($6,950,800, or 23 per cent), reduced expenditures for security services, owing to the discontinuation of services of explosive detection dogs; lower expenditures for generator fuel, owing to improvements in the power supply in 2013 in Baghdad and Erbil; and lower-than-budgeted expenditures for field defence supplies, owing to non-acquisition of netting for the Kirkuk compound since the facility now has hardwall structures (ibid., para. 299); (c) Under air transportation ($1,510.9, or 3 per cent), lower projected expenditures for fixed-wing aircraft and fuel, owing to the discontinuation of flights to Amman since June 2013; projected lower-than-budgeted flight hours for rotary-wing aircraft, owing to increased movement by road for airport transfers; and projected lower requirements, owing to a revision in the security requirements, resulting in lower usage of flares for aircraft (ibid., para. 306); (d) Under medical ($1,184,600, or 60 per cent), owing mainly to lower requirements and costs for medical drugs and consumables, lower requirements for aeromedical evacuation services and lower-than-budgeted requirements for the Level 1 starter set in Kirkuk (ibid., para. 314); (e) Under communications ($615,500, or 6 per cent), lower projected expenditures for communications support services for videoteleconferencing charges and antenna mast services, and lower projected expenditures for spare parts (ibid., para. 309). 213. The estimated requirements for UNAMI for 2014 amount to $138,809,100, representing a net decrease of $2,885,600, or 2 per cent, compared with the appropriation of $141,694,700 for 2013 (ibid., table 6). 214. The mandate of UNAMI is summarized in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General. Based on the period preceding the governorate council elections in 2013, increased polarization, discontent and violence ahead of the planned national elections in 2014 is possible. In that context, it is assumed that reaching political compromise or agreement on contentious issues prior to the elections will be particularly challenging. UNAMI will remain engaged with political blocs to facilitate dialogue and peaceful means of conflict resolution, and, depending on the electoral outcomes, UNAMI may be favourably positioned to provide assistance in the formation of a new Government (ibid., para. 50). UNAMI also anticipates undertaking liaison functions in Amman, in view of the evolving political situation, in order to strengthen outreach to relevant stakeholders critical to Iraq's national reconciliation process (ibid., para. 51). In addition, the Secretary-General indicates in his report that UNAMI will continue facilitating the resolution of the remaining issues between Iraq and Kuwait and that, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2107 (2013), the Mission has taken over the mandate regarding the issue of missing Kuwaiti persons and property (ibid., para. 52). The Advisory Committee provides its comments on the strengthening of the Amman office and on the mandates assumed by UNAMI in paragraphs 235-238 below. 215. The UNAMI budget for 2014 provides for the deployment of an authorized strength of 13 seconded military advisers, 6 seconded police advisers and 272 contingent personnel of the Guard Unit. The proposed resource requirements for military and police personnel of $11,709,500 reflect a decrease of $1,332,700, or 10.2 per cent, compared with the apportionment of $13,042,200 for 2013, which is the net result of reduced requirements under military observers ($132,500, or 35.2 per cent), military contingents ($962,400, or 8.7 per cent) and United Nations police ($237,800, or 84.6 per cent). 216. The reduced requirement under military observers is attributable to the decreased mission subsistence allowance rate; the decrease in the daily rates for logistics/life support services in Baghdad from $180 to $163, from $49 to $39 at Baghdad International Airport and from $49 to $41.50 in Kirkuk. The reduced requirement under military contingents is attributable mainly to the reduction in daily rates for logistics/life support services and to a reconfiguration of the deployment locations of contingents, with 15 United Nations guard units now operating from the UNAMI compound in Erbil, while these were previously budgeted at Baghdad rates. The reduction in the requirement under United Nations police is attributable to a decrease in the mission subsistence allowance rate and to the reduction in the daily rates for logistics/life support services. 217. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the resources proposed for military and police personnel for 2014. 218. The proposed resource requirements for civilian personnel for 2014 of $70,155,800 reflect an increase of $2,356,500, or 3.5 per cent, compared with the apportionment of $67,799,300 for 2013. The increased requirements are attributable to (a) under international positions, increased provision for common staff costs, based on expenditure trends, and to the inclusion of ticket costs for rest and recuperation travel, as a result of the cancellation of flights to Amman; and (b) under national positions, to the utilization of the latest salary scales, the application of a lower vacancy rate of 16 per cent for Local level staff, based on actual average vacancy rates for the first seven months of 2013, compared with the budgeted rate of 20 per cent in 2013; and the increase in the danger pay rate for eligible staff from $440 for National Professional Officers and $406 for Local level staff in 2013 to $585 in 2014. 219. The proposed staffing for 2014 consists of 956 positions, comprising 399 international staff (175 Professional and 224 Field Service), and 557 national staff (91 National Professional Officers and 466 Local level staff), reflecting a net decrease of 3 positions, compared with the approved staffing levels for 2013. The proposed staffing changes include the establishment of nine new positions (1 P-5, 2 P-4, 3 P-3, 1 Field Service, 1 National Professional Officer and 1 Local level) and the abolishment of 6 positions (2 P-5, 1 P-4, 2 P-3 and 1 Field Service). The Secretary-General provides a summary of the proposed staffing changes in table 2 of his report, while tables 3, 4 and 5, respectively, provide details on the proposed staffing requirements by location, proposed new positions and proposed abolishments. Table 20 below provides a summary of the approved staffing of the Mission in 2013 and the staffing proposals of the Secretary-General for 2014.

Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was provided with a summary of proposed redeployments for 2014, which excludes geographic redeployments within existing organizational units (see table 21 below). Table 21 Proposed redeployments of approved positions for 2014 International staff: 11 positions National staff: 9 positions Position From To 1 P-5 1 P-4 2 P-3 3 NPO 1 LL Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General Joint Analysis Unit 1 P-4 2 P-3 1 FS 1 NPO 1 LL Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Integrated Coordination of Development and Humanitarian Affairs 1 LL Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Political Affairs and Electoral Assistance Office of Political Affairs Office of the Chief of Mission Support Engineering and Building Management Section General Service Section Office of the Chief Administration Services 1 P-4 1 P-3 1 FS Medical Services 221. The UNAMI budget for 2014 is based on vacancy rates of 10 per cent for international personnel; 20 per cent for National Professional Officers; and 16 per cent for Local level staff, compared with the actual vacancy rate for Local level staff of 15 per cent in 2013. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the average vacancy rate for international staff for the period from 1 January to August 2013 had been 11.8 per cent and that in the month of August 2013 it was 15 per cent. The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to adjust the resources for international positions based on a vacancy rate of 12 per cent in 2014. 222. Regarding the proposals for the establishment of new positions and the redeployment of existing positions in UNAMI, the Advisory Committee recalls its view that the Secretary-General should, on an ongoing basis, be requested to review staffing requirements to determine whether existing functions remain necessary, that, in general, positions that are no longer required should be abolished and that any new positions should be fully justified (A/67/604, para. 28). In that regard, the Committee is of the view that a number of the staffing proposals of the Secretary-General for UNAMI are not sufficiently justified, and it recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to undertake a comprehensive review of the staffing requirements of the Mission, including the organizational structure and the number and level of senior positions, in the light of the evolution of the mandate of UNAMI, for inclusion in the 2015 budget submission. The Committee provides its comments and recommendations on the proposed abolishments, redeployments and new positions for UNAMI by component in the paragraphs below. 223. The Secretary-General indicates in his report that the Resident Auditor's Office would continue to comprise one Resident Auditor (P-4), one Auditor (P-3), one Administrative Assistant (Field Service) and one Accounting Assistant (Local level) (ibid., para. 68). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the UNAMI Resident Auditor's Office was responsible for overseeing the implementation of the audit workplan in UNAMI and providing ongoing independent advice to the Mission's management on governance, risk management and internal controls processes. According to the Secretary-General, the Resident Auditor's Office was established in Kuwait and will remain there for the 2014 budget period, owing to the limited availability of accommodations brought about by the security situation in Baghdad (ibid., para. 68). However, from its review of resident auditor arrangements for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), the Committee notes that it is proposed in 2014 to deploy one National Professional Officer position of Resident Auditor in Kabul, particularly in view of the fact that audit planning activities are required to be conducted at/from that location (see A/68/327/Add.4, para. 75 (c)). 224. In that regard, the Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the practice of the Office of Internal Oversight Services had been to locate resident auditors with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, but that owing to the security situation in 2013, the Special Representatives of the Secretary-General of both UNAMI and UNAMA had requested that their respective resident auditor offices be located in Kuwait. The Committee was informed that the Office of Internal Oversight Services recognized the benefits of locating its auditors in Kuwait, provided that adequate resources were available for travel to Iraq and Afghanistan. However, in the case of UNAMA, the Office of Internal Oversight Services found it necessary to have the presence of one Auditor based in Kabul, particularly since most of the substantive programme operations were located there, to expedite the audit process through gathering relevant audit evidence and in conducting meetings with programme managers. The Committee was further informed that in UNAMI, the security situation continues to deteriorate; the Office of Internal Oversight Services therefore proposed that all resident auditor staff for UNAMI be located in Kuwait. 225. While recognizing that planning for the deployment of mission personnel in Iraq is made on the basis of a number of factors, including the need for specialized capacity at the Mission's headquarters and the need to ensure safety and security, the Advisory Committee considers that the redeployment of some resident auditor capacity from Kuwait to UNAMI headquarters could improve the effectiveness of the resident auditor function in the Mission, could generate savings under travel and related costs and could facilitate the coverage of the regional offices of the Mission in Iraq. Noting that the UNAMI Resident Auditor's Office has been located in Kuwait since its establishment, and taking into account the increased need for oversight regarding the construction of the integrated Mission headquarters in Baghdad, the Committee expects that UNAMI will endeavour to assign resident auditor capacity in Iraq as soon as feasible. The Committee further recommends that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to review the optimal deployment of resident auditors in UNAMI and to report thereon in the context of the 2015 budget submission. The Committee makes further comments and recommendations on the Kuwait Joint Support Office in section III and on the location of resident auditors in UNAMA in section IV.D above. 226. The Secretary-General proposes to rename the Joint Analysis and Policy Unit, which was established in 2013 within the Office of the Special Representative, as the Joint Analysis Unit in 2014, and to establish it as a stand-alone unit. It is proposed to redeploy the following positions from the Office of the Special Representative to form the Unit: one Chief of Unit (P-5), one Deputy Chief Analyst (P-4), one Information Analyst (P-3), one Information Manager (P-3) to function as Political Affairs Officer (P-3), one Analysis Officer (National Professional Officer), one Remote Sensing/Geographic Information System Expert (National Professional Officer), one Research Analyst (National Professional Officer) and one Administrative/Language Assistant (Local level) (A/68/327/Add.5, para. 70). In addition, one Humanitarian Affairs Officer position (P-4), one Economic and Social Analyst position (P-3), one Website Developer and Data Exchange Manager position (P-3), one Information Management Assistant position (Field Service), one Geographic Information System Officer position (National Professional Officer), and one Geographic Information System Assistance position (Local level) are proposed to be redeployed from the Integrated Coordination Office for Development and Humanitarian Affairs to the Joint Analysis Unit. One existing position of Humanitarian Affairs Officer (P-3) is proposed to be abolished in the Joint Analysis and Policy Unit (ibid., para. 71). 227. According to the Secretary-General, the Joint Analysis and Policy Unit, in collaboration with the Information Analysis Unit, the latter reporting to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Development and Humanitarian Affairs, has responded to the need for a comprehensive information and analysis capacity. The Unit delivered a range of analytical products in 2013, including the establishment of an information and data repository (www.japuiraq.org) (ibid., para. 83) and provided services to the United Nations country team. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Joint Analysis Unit in 2014 would focus primarily on such cross-cutting issues as energy, development and the economy, access to education, environment, demographics and minorities. The Joint Analysis Unit would provide an important link between UNAMI and the agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system on the implementation of their different mandates in Iraq, allowing for a consolidated and coordinated approach to cross-cutting issues. According to the Mission, its analytical research, information products (including reports and profiles, information repositories on key indicators and actors), and advocacy materials contribute to a more coherent United Nations effort in Iraq. The Committee was informed that, by combining the socioeconomic capacity of the Information Analysis Unit with the cross-disciplinary analytical research capability of the Joint Analysis and Policy Unit, the new Joint Analysis Unit would offer a more comprehensive approach to providing services and products, tackling issues from a multidisciplinary perspective. 228. While the Advisory Committee has no objection to the staffing changes proposed by the Secretary-General related to the creation of the Joint Analysis Unit, it is of the view that the combination of the existing staffing resources in the new Unit may permit a reduction in its overall staffing complement. The Committee expects that the staffing for the Unit will be reviewed in the context of the comprehensive review of the staffing requirements of the Mission (see para. 222 above). 229. The Secretary-General proposes to establish one new National Professional Officer position of Programme Officer to be based in Baghdad, and one new Local level Administrative Assistant position, to be based in Kuwait, under the Office of the Chief of Staff for the integrated Conduct and Discipline Team, which would be complemented by resources funded through UNAMA, including one P-4 position proposed to be upgraded to the P-5 level and one National Professional Officer position. In that regard, the Secretary-General also proposes to abolish one Conduct and Discipline Officer position (P-5) in Kuwait under the UNAMI budget. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the staffing changes proposed by the Secretary-General. The Committee provides its comments and recommendations on the integrated Conduct and Discipline Team in Kuwait in section IV.D above. 230. In his report, the Secretary-General indicates that UNAMI will continue to facilitate the resolution of the remaining issues between Iraq and Kuwait and that, pursuant to Security Council resolution 2017 (2013), UNAMI has taken over the mandate regarding the issue of missing Kuwaiti persons and property (ibid., para. 52). In this regard, the Secretary-General proposes to establish two new Political Affairs Officer positions at the P-4 and P-3 levels in Baghdad and Kuwait, respectively, that would perform facilitation and liaison functions with Iraqi and Kuwaiti authorities (ibid., para. 104). According to the Secretary-General, UNAMI will promote, support and facilitate efforts regarding the repatriation of all Kuwaiti and third-country nationals or their remains, and the return of Kuwaiti property, including the national archives, seized by Iraq (ibid., para. 98). 231. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that UNAMI closely monitors the process of normalization of relations between the two neighbouring countries in the fields of boundary maintenance, maritime boundaries and other related issues, as defined by Security Council resolution 1770 (2007), and that the remaining issues between Iraq and Kuwait referred to in paragraph 52 of the report related mainly to missing Kuwaiti and third-country nationals and missing Kuwaiti property. The Committee was further informed that the existence of mechanisms between the Governments of Iraq and Kuwait concerning those issues did not preclude a role for UNAMI, which acts as a facilitator, and that its role was supplementary to the activities of such bodies. The Committee was informed that in 2014 UNAMI would encourage, provide advice to and support the Governments of Iraq and Kuwait in their efforts and, if so decided, would participate in bilateral bodies, including the Iraqi-Kuwaiti committees on property. 232. In paragraph 40 of his report, the Secretary-General indicates that UNAMI continued in 2013 to engage key Iraqi and Kuwaiti interlocutors to advance the normalization of relations between the two countries and that, with the Mission's facilitation, Iraqi Airways flights to Kuwait were resumed; the fieldwork of the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Maintenance Project was completed, pursuant to Security Council resolution 833 (1993); a bilateral technical arrangement was established to maintain their common boundary; and an agreement was signed to transfer the funds set aside with the United Nations for the compensation of Iraqi private citizens relocated as a result of the border demarcation, pursuant to Council resolution 899 (1994). With regard to the implementation of Council resolution 1284 (1999) on the repatriation or return of Kuwaitis and third-country nationals or their remains and missing Kuwaiti property, including the national archives, UNAMI facilitated two visits to Kuwait and a visit to Iraq by a Senior Political Affairs Officer. 233. The Secretary-General also indicates in his report that the Security Council, in its resolution 2107 (2013), entrusted the former responsibilities of the High-level Coordinator on Kuwaiti Missing Persons and Property to UNAMI (ibid., para. 40). The Advisory Committee was informed that since the adoption of resolution 2107 (2013), two Political Affairs Officers (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) under the guidance of the Chief of the Office of Political Affairs had been assigned to this portfolio, in addition to performing other advisory and reporting tasks, and that the Department of Political Affairs Iraq Team in New York also supported UNAMI efforts to implement resolution 2107 (2013), including coordinating the submission of reports of the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 4 of that resolution, as part of its overall political, operational and planning backstopping to UNAMI. The Committee was informed that since the volume of work might increase in the coming period, the ad hoc arrangements relying on the two existing Political Affairs Officers should not be continued, and that those functions should be performed by the two new proposed positions at the P-4 and P-3 levels. 234. The Advisory Committee considers that the requirement for the proposed new positions for Political Affairs Officers at the P-4 and P-3 levels to facilitate the resolution of the remaining issues between Iraq and Kuwait has not been adequately justified and that the tasks envisaged for the positions could be met from the existing staffing complement of the Office of Political Affairs. The Committee recommends against the approval of the two proposed positions of Political Affairs Officers at the P-4 level in Baghdad and at the P-3 level in Kuwait. Amman Office 235. The Secretary-General proposes to redeploy one Senior Political Affairs Officer position (P-5), one Language Assistant position (Local level) and one Administrative Assistant position (Local level) from the Office of Political Affairs in Baghdad to the Amman Office. According to the Secretary-General, the UNAMI political presence in Amman would provide the mediation and conflict resolution support required to achieve national dialogue and reconciliation, and to support the high-level advocacy and negotiations conducted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the political team in the broader context of its mandate and in consultation with the Government (ibid., para. 15). The Amman Office would maintain regular contact with Iraqi leaders exiled to or visiting Amman and would facilitate and participate in the negotiations conducted by the Mission's leadership (ibid., para. 107). 236. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that, since the sectarian and political tensions remain unresolved, influential Iraqi political, religious and social leaders were increasingly operating out of Amman, and that intensified outreach by UNAMI to those interlocutors for the purpose of facilitating dialogue was important to serve its mandate fully. The Committee was informed that Amman was where Iraqi and regional leaders often held initiatives to discuss complex issues that UNAMI was called upon to monitor and/or facilitate. At the same time, the Amman Office would assist UNAMI work on such issues as Iraq's engagement with its neighbours in respect of the ongoing crisis in Syria and other areas of cooperation that might emerge. 237. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the role envisaged for the political presence in the Amman Office was not new and would not require a revision to the UNAMI mandate. The Committee was further informed that UNAMI had maintained a political presence in Amman until 2008 to carry out similar assignments, under the supervision of the Director of the Office of Political and Constitutional Affairs, under the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Political Affairs. 238. The Advisory Committee is not convinced of the need for the redeployment of a language assistant position from Baghdad to Amman and recommends against the approval of the redeployment of such a Local level position. The Committee has no objection to the proposal of the Secretary-General to redeploy one Senior Political Affairs Officer position (P-5) and one Administrative Assistant position (Local level) from the Office of Political Affairs in Baghdad to the Amman Office. The Committee expects that the continued requirement for those two positions in Amman will be fully justified, if necessary, in the 2015 budget submission. Redefinition of Constitutional Affairs Officer positions 239. The Advisory Committee notes that two existing Constitutional Affairs Officers (1 P-4 and 1 P-3) based in Baghdad are proposed to continue as Political Affairs Officers in the Office of Political Affairs, without specific justification for their continued retention (ibid., para. 115). Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the incumbents of the two positions would work on the unfinished legislative agenda, which includes the creation of the Federation Council and the enactment of a law on minorities. The primary role of the two positions was to coordinate with counterparts in the Council of Representatives, identify their needs for assistance and design the Mission's political and technical engagement in cooperation with external and/or in-house resources, including experts registered in the Mediation and Support Unit roster in the Department of Political Affairs at United Nations Headquarters. The Advisory Committee notes that the two positions of Constitutional Affairs Officer are no longer required for the purpose for which they were established and have been assigned new functions. The Committee is not convinced that the proposed functions for the two positions cannot be performed by the existing staffing complement of the Office of Political Affairs. The Committee therefore expects that the continued requirement for the retention of the positions, if necessary, will be fully justified in the 2015 budget submission. 240. According to the Secretary-General, UNAMI proposes, in response to concerns previously expressed by the Advisory Committee, to establish a position of Senior Project Officer at the P-5 level. The position would be under the direct supervision of the Chief of Mission Support and would oversee the construction of an integrated compound and the use of contributions of $50.8 million from the Government of Iraq and other donors to a trust fund administered by the Mission for this purpose. The Senior Project Officer would be responsible for the overall management of the project, including the technical engineering aspects of each of its phases, namely, design, construction and implementation (ibid., para. 178). Further details on the construction project are provided in section V of the report of the Secretary-General. 241. The Advisory Committee notes that the approved position of Senior Project Officer had been redeployed in 2013 from the Headquarters Construction Unit in Baghdad to the Office of the Special Representative for the position of Chief of the Joint Analysis and Policy Unit. According to the Secretary-General, the position was redeployed due to the proposed outsourcing of the construction of the integrated Mission headquarters in Iraq. Following a reassessment of the project management modality, the position has been once again proposed for establishment (ibid., para. 179). The Advisory Committee recalls that, specifically noting the proposed redeployment of the position of Senior Project Officer to the Joint Analysis and Policy Unit in 2013, it had emphasized the need for close supervision and oversight of the implementation of the project (see A/67/604, para. 254). The Committee has no objection to the proposed establishment of the position of Senior Project Officer at this time and it expects that the construction of the integrated compound is being properly monitored and will be brought to a successful conclusion. 242. In his report, the Secretary-General indicates that, in order to provide administrative support to the Chief of Mission Support, one Administrative Officer position at the P-4 level is proposed to be established (A/68/327/Add.5, para. 180). However, no specific justification is provided. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the proposed position would provide direct support to the Chief of Mission Support, including, inter alia, in preparing briefings and reports to senior leadership and in coordinating the preparations for meetings with the Governments of Iraq and Kuwait on all administrative and support issues. The Advisory Committee is not convinced that there has been an increase in the workload or significant change in the structure of the mission support component to justify the additional position and it therefore recommends against approval of the proposed P-4 position of Administrative Officer. Contracts Management Unit 243. In his report, the Secretary-General proposes to establish one Contracts Management Officer position at the P-3 level in the Contracts Management Unit to provide support in the management of the Mission's contracts (ibid., para. 181), without any specific justification of the requirement for this position. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the position was required to strengthen the management of the Mission's contracts, following an audit report that indicated lack of proper governance, poor risk management and control needed to give the Mission reasonable assurances regarding the management of the contracts. Upon further enquiry, the Committee was informed that the audit report was issued by the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The Advisory Committee is not convinced that the problems identified with the contracts management function require the addition of a new position. The Committee therefore recommends against approval of the proposed position of Contracts Management Officer at the P-3 level. The Committee expects UNAMI to take measures to address the deficiencies identified in contract management and that Headquarters will provide oversight, as required. Office of the Chief of Administrative Services 244. The Secretary-General proposes the establishment of one Administrative Officer position (P-3) in order to strengthen administrative functions within the Office of the Chief of Administration Services. The new position would augment the administrative capacity of the service, particularly in the areas of follow-up on audit recommendations, management evaluation cases and the professional support required on local review boards, such as the Claims Board, the Local Committee on Contracts and the Local Property Survey Board (ibid., para. 193). The Advisory Committee has not been provided with sufficient justification for the requirement for the position and it therefore recommends against the approval of the proposed P-3 position of Administrative Officer in the Office of the Chief of Administrative Services. Mission support in the Amman Office 245. The Secretary-General indicates in his report that the UNAMI Amman office drawdown, which commenced in 2012, was largely completed during the 2013 budget cycle. With the exception of the security awareness induction trainers, who for technical and logistical reasons remain in Amman, all substantive personnel had been transferred out of Amman by August 2013 (ibid., para. 14). In this regard, the Secretary-General indicates that the United Nations country team would relocate from Amman to Iraq by the end of 2013 (ibid., para. 157 (b)). The Advisory Committee notes that the six existing Local level positions in the Amman Office have not been proposed for abolishment, and that three have been proposed to be redeployed to Kuwait and three have been proposed to be redeployed to Baghdad. Upon enquiry, the Committee was provided with additional information on the proposed redeployment of mission support positions from the Amman Office (see table 22 below). Table 22 Proposed redeployment of mission support positions from the Amman Office of the Section/location Title/level Regional Office (Amman), Office of the Chief of Mission Support Administrative Assistant (Local level) Budget Unit (Kuwait) Budget and Administrative Assistant (Local level) General Service Section (Amman) Facilities Management Assistant (Local level) General Service Section (Kuwait) Aviation Section (Amman) Movement Control Clerk (Local level) Aviation Section (Kuwait) Movement Control Assistant (Local level) Property Control and Inventory Assistant (Local level) General Service Section (Baghdad) Communications and Information Technology Section (Amman) Information Technology Assistant (Local level) Communications and Information Technology Section (Baghdad) Engineering and Building Management Section (Amman) Assistant Engineer (Local level) Engineering and Building Management Section (Baghdad) (Local Level) 246. The Advisory Committee considers that the mission support positions proposed for redeployment from the Amman Office should have been presented as abolishments of positions and that any additional requirement for new positions in the mission support component should have been fully justified. The Committee expects that the continued retention of all mission support positions will be fully justified, if necessary, in the context of the 2015 budget submission. 247. Taking into account its comments and recommendations in the present report, the Advisory Committee has no objection to the staffing changes proposed by the Secretary-General for 2014. 248. Key variances under operational costs between the requirements for 2014 and the apportionment for 2013 include in the following reductions: (a) Under facilities and infrastructure ($1,685,100, or 12.3 per cent); (b) Under air transportation ($671,300, or 3.6 per cent), due mainly to a reduction in costs and requirements for fixed-wing aircraft; (c) Under other supplies, services and equipment ($524,700, or 3.2 per cent), due mainly to lower estimates for civilian staff based on current costs, lower requirements for training fees, supplies and services, due to a lower number of new staff requiring security induction awareness training and a lower requirement for freight services, due to the use of mission air assets for the transportation of goods from Kuwait to Iraq; (d) Under communications ($96,400, or 2.2 per cent), due mainly to lower requirements for commercial communications, spare parts and consumables and support services, offset in part by increased requirements for acquisition and replacement of equipment; (e) Under official travel ($522,100, or 20.8 per cent), is attributable mainly to a reduction in provisions for within-mission travel as a result of the increased installation of staff in Iraq; (f) Under quick-impact projects ($500,000, or 50 per cent), as a result of the deteriorating security situation in Iraq, which has rendered project oversight by UNAMI field staff increasingly difficult and has frequently prevented the timely transmission of programmatic and financial documentation to Baghdad. 249. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the proposals of the Secretary-General for operational costs, on the understanding that these requirements will be adjusted commensurate with the Committee's recommendations on new positions, as set out in the present report. V. Recommendations for action required of the General Assembly 250. With regard to the Secretary-General's proposal for action to be taken by the General Assembly, as set out in section III of his report (A/68/327), the Advisory Committee recommends as follows: (a) With regard to the 34 special political missions listed in table 4 of the report, that, for the period up to 31 December 2014, the General Assembly approve the resources requested by the Secretary-General, subject to its observations and recommendations as set out above. The Committee requests that the adjusted amount be provided to the Assembly at the time of its consideration of the proposals of the Secretary-General; (b) That the General Assembly approve a charge in the adjusted amount referred to in subparagraph (a) above against the provision for special political missions in section 3, Political affairs, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015.

In addition, the incumbent contributes to drafting background notes, talking points and other correspondence related to the Syrian conflict for senior United Nations officials The Advisory Committee was informed that the following efficiency measures have been implemented at the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and are reflected in the budgetary estimates for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2014: (a) UNAMA will increasingly rely on alternative supply routes to the north and west of Afghanistan through the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, rather than rely on routing freight through Port Karachi and inland through Pakistan to border crossings in eastern Afghanistan, which results in delays and demurrage charges; (b) Electronic processing for passengers is fully implemented and is expected to be fully operational for cargo by January 2014; this will improve the accuracy and timeliness of passenger and cargo data for meeting safety and security requirements; (c) An industry-standard supply chain to enhance service delivery; (d) Improved disposal of assets procedures so that assets identified for destruction are disposed of within two weeks of approval, compared to the previous average of 30 days between final write-off approval and actual disposal of assets; the reduction of the maximum time for the Local Property Survey Board to complete its work from 90 days to 52 days; and the process of disposal by sale is reduced from 514 days to 281 days; (e) A reduction in stock holdings and limiting the acquisition of slow-moving equipment to avoid overstocks; (f) By reducing the fleet and rescheduling flights, substantial and sustainable gains are anticipated in aircraft fleet costs, fuel and other contract operating expenses. The contract covering one CRJ-200 aircraft was terminated, effective 1 July 2013, which is expected to yield savings of $3 million for the period from July to December 2013, and $6 million for the period from January to December 2014. Due to the rescheduling of flights, there has been a reduction of 840 hours, and savings of $1.17 million are expected in 2014, including $413,940 in flight hours and $763,344 in fuel consumption. Aircraft fleet costs have been further reduced by renegotiating fixed costs of contract extensions to align with lower market costs; (g) The replacement of global sourcing with local supply, when appropriate, has reduced stock holdings of stationery from 8 to 3 months, and reduced the need for warehouse space. A similar approach is being taken with a local contract for sanitation and cleaning supplies, which has reduced the cost per staff member from $12 to $4 per month; (h) The outsourcing of generator operation and maintenance services, which will affect 18 UNAMA compounds in Afghanistan; (i) Outsourcing of general engineering maintenance services, including electrical, plumbing, carpentry, HVAC and masonry, will replace the existing Mission capacity in regional and provincial offices; (j) Establishing a formal contract for the removal of solid and liquid wastes in place of local informal arrangements.
