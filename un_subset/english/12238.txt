UNITED NATIONS E Economic and Social Council Distr. Original: COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS Fifty-sixth session Agenda item 12 (a) INTEGRATION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND THE GENDER PERSPECTIVE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN Note by the secretariat The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in reference to comments of the Cuban authorities contained in document E/CN.4/2000/131, wishes to place on record the following observations: (a) OHCHR maintains scrupulous objectivity vis√†vis all Member States, including Cuba. (b) OHCHR considers that the staff member named in the Cuban note acted in good faith and with integrity. (c) The report of the Special Rapporteur contains many portions favourable to the Cuban authorities - which bears out the objectivity of the Special Rapporteur and her staff. (d) The acquisition of internal correspondence and its use in the manner employed in the Cuban comments raises issues of principle and propriety that call for further examination. We have sought legal advice on this from the Office of Legal Affairs which has been shared with the Permanent Mission of Cuba. GE.00-12489 (E)
