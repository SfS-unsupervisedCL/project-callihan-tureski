The United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1159 (1998) of 27 March 1998, effective 15 April 1998 for an initial period of three months until 15 July 1998. By the same resolution, the Council authorized the Member States participating in the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui Agreements (MISAB) and those States providing logistical support to ensure security and freedom of movement of their personnel and decided that this authorization would end on 15 April 1998. The Council also authorized the Secretary-General to take the measures necessary to ensure that MINURCA is fully deployed by 15 April 1998 and to secure a smooth transition between MISAB and MINURCA. 2. The formal establishment of MINURCA was accompanied by a transfer of authority on 15 April 1998 of MISAB forces to United Nations command. Pursuant to paragraph 11 of Security Council resolution 1159 (1998), the transfer of authority was preceded by a transitional period from 27 March to 14 April 1998 during which the United Nations advance headquarters, comprising military and civilian personnel and essential equipment, was deployed to Bangui. 3. In paragraph 2 of the annex to his report of 23 February 1998 (S/1998/148), the Secretary-General indicated that the mandate of MINURCA would be of a limited duration and, subject to the decision of the Security Council, would end 90 days after the announcement of the election results, with the actual drawdown of the Mission beginning no later than 60 days from the date of such an announcement. Pending the submission by 20 June 1998 of a report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the mandate of MINURCA and of his recommendations on the future role of the United Nations in the legislative elections process, as requested by the Council in paragraphs 15 and 16 of its resolution 1159 (1998), the proposed budget for MINURCA for the financial period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 covers the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 and is based on the Mission’s maintenance requirements and the time-frame predicated on the holding of elections in August/September 1998. The proposed budget for the withdrawal of military contingents and liquidation of MINURCA would be submitted to the General Assembly at a later time, after a decision on the Mission’s future will have been taken by the Council. 4. Pending the submission of the present report on the financing of MINURCA, the Controller sought, in his letter dated 30 March 1998, the concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to enter into commitments in an amount of $12,844,900 gross ($12,469,900 net) to meet the most immediate requirements of MINURCA for the period from 27 March to 30 June 1998. The Committee, in the Chairman’s letter dated 13 April 1998, concurred, without prejudice to any action it might take on the detailed report on the financing of the Mission, on entering into commitments in the amount requested. 5. The mandate of MINURCA, with an authorized strength of 1,350 military personnel, consists of the following tasks: (a) To assist in maintaining and enhancing security and stability, including freedom of movement, in Bangui and the immediate vicinity of the city; (b) To assist the national security forces in maintaining law and order and in protecting key installations in Bangui; (c) To supervise, control storage and monitor the final disposition of all weapons retrieved in the course of the disarmament exercise; (d) To ensure security and freedom of movement of United Nations personnel and the safety and security of United Nations property; (e) To assist in coordination with other international efforts in a short-term police trainers programme and in other capacity-building efforts of the national police, and to provide advice on the restructuring of the national police and special police forces; (f) To provide advice and technical support to the national electoral bodies regarding the electoral code and plans for the conduct of the legislative elections scheduled for August/September 1998. 6. In paragraph 14 of its resolution 1159 (1998), the Security Council welcomed the appointment by the Secretary-General of his Special Representative in the Central African Republic: (a) To assist in the promotion of the reforms necessary to achieve national reconciliation, security and stability in the country; (b) To head MINURCA; (c) To have overall authority over all United Nations activities in the Central African Republic, in support of the MINURCA mandate; (d) To provide good offices and mediation between the Government and political parties; (e) To provide advice and facilitate technical assistance in the areas of good governance and the rule of law; (f) To cooperate with other international partners, including international financial institutions, with the objective of supporting activities aimed at establishing the foundations for lasting peace, national reconstruction and development; (g) To encourage the United Nations agencies and programmes to provide assistance to the Central African Republic, in particular in the areas referred to in the report of the Secretary-General (S/1998/148). 7. The operational plan and requirements of MINURCA are described in the annex to the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council dated 23 February 1998 (S/1998/148). In order to achieve the objectives set out therein, the operational plan for MINURCA calls for: (a) a military component under the Force Commander comprising up to 1,350 personnel of all ranks, including six mechanized infantry companies, a light armoured squadron, security and quick reaction infantry companies, including a heavy mortar platoon and an amphibious section, and logistics, signals and medical units; (b) a civilian police component of 24 civilian police experts headed by a Senior Civilian Police Adviser; (c) the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of Mission and substantive offices comprising 26 international and 21 local staff; and (d) an administrative component, comprising 79 international and 52 local staff, headed by a Chief Administrative Officer. The civilian and force organization charts appear in annex IV to the present report. 8. In accordance with section I of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994, the 12-month financial period covering accounts of MINURCA will begin on 1 July of one year and terminate on 30 June of the following year. The Secretary-General proposed the establishment of a special account for MINURCA for the purpose of accounting for income received and expenditures incurred in respect of the Mission. 9. The Government of France has provided a voluntary contribution in kind consisting of aircraft services for the deployment of contingents and of a partial waiver of the reimbursement costs for military equipment and medical services provided to MINURCA. As shown in annex VII to the present report, the estimated value of that contribution amounts to $967,400 for the period from 27 March to 30 June 1998 and $1,137,500 for the subsequent period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. The Government of Denmark has indicated its intention to provide radio broadcasting equipment and personnel to enhance the Mission’s public information capacity. At the time of the preparation of the present report, the value of that contribution had not yet been established. 10. In accordance with paragraph 18 of Security Council resolution 1159 (1998), a trust fund was established in order to enable Member States to make voluntary contributions to support the activities of MINURCA and to assist in the financing of the Mission. As at 1 May 1998, no voluntary contributions had been received. 11. The Governments of Burkina Faso, Canada, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, France, Gabon, Mali, Senegal and Togo have provided troops to MINURCA. Additionally, the Government of Egypt has indicated its agreement to deploy troops in May 1998. Reimbursement of standard troop costs will be authorized upon approval by the General Assembly of the Mission’s proposed budget and receipt of assessed contributions. 12. In response to the letter of 22 April 1998 from the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Central African Republic and Head of MINURCA transmitting a draft status-of-forces agreement to the Government of the Central African Republic, the latter has indicated its agreement to the terms and conditions contained in the draft agreement. The Government of the Central African Republic has also confirmed the provision to MINURCA at no cost of accommodation facilities at Camp Beal. At the time of the preparation of the present report, the value of that contribution had not yet been determined. 13. The proposed budget for the establishment and operation of MINURCA for the period from 27 March to 30 June 1997, inclusive of the transition period from 27 March to 14 April 1998, amounts, on a full-cost basis, to $20,776,000 gross ($20,438,400 net), inclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in kind estimated at $967,400. From the total amount, non-recurrent start-up costs amount to $7,493,500 gross and net, inclusive of a budgeted voluntary contribution in kind of $407,200, while recurrent costs are estimated at $13,282,500 gross ($12,944,900 net) inclusive of a budgeted voluntary contribution of $560,200. The cost estimates provide for 1,350 military contingent personnel, 24 civilian police experts, 106 international staff and 73 local staff. Some 60 per cent of the total amount is based on standard costs and ratios contained in the Standard Ratios and Standard Cost Manual, while the remaining 40 per cent covers mission-specific requirements and other items that may vary from the standards. Those mission-specific requirements and variations are described in annex III.A to the present report. 14.

The cost estimates provide for the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel, 24 civilian police experts, 106 international staff and 73 local staff. Some 55 per cent of the total amount is based on standard costs and ratios contained in the Standard Ratios and Standard Cost Manual, while the remaining 45 per cent covers mission-specific requirements and other items that may vary from the standards. Those mission-specific requirements and variations are described in annex III.A to the present report. 16.

To secure a smooth transition between MISAB and the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA), pursuant to paragraph 11 of Security Council resolution 1159 (1998) of 27 March 1998, provision is made for the travel to Bangui of 20 military staff from the Headquarters Military Adviser’s Office, logistics and field communications personnel for a total of 465 person-days to assist in setting up the Mission’s military headquarters, administrative structures and communications network ($146,600) and for the advance deployment of 20 MINURCA force headquarters staff officers for 360 person-days ($50,800). Provision is also made for travel for political consultations with Governments participating in MISAB for a total of 25 person-days ($10,500) and technical assessment and survey missions for a total of 41 person-days ($24,900). The total amount provided under other travel costs is $182,000. 2. International and local civilian staff. Provision of $130,500 is made at the 1998 standard salary cost rates for New York for salary costs of a small team of international civilian personnel deployed as an advance civilian Mission headquarters for a total of 100 person-days (international staff salaries ( $21,700), common staff costs, inclusive of travel on appointment ($100,300) and mission subsistence allowance ($8,500). Provision of $5,200 is also made for local staff salaries for 150 person-days based on the salary scale applicable to the mission area ($4,200) and common staff costs ($1,000)). 2. Initial mandate period from 15 April up to 30 June 1998 and subsequent period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 3. Military contingents. Provision for military contingents is based on the deployment of 1,230 contingent personnel as at 15 April 1998 and on the assumption that the authorized strength of 1,350 personnel of all ranks would be attained by 15 May 1998. The amounts shown in column 1 of annexes I and II provide for the reimbursement of troop costs and payment of daily allowance at standard rates for 3,278 person-months (100,000 person-days) for the period from 15 April to 30 June and for 6,750 person-months (206,600 person-days) for the subsequent period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. Provision for welfare reflects the established self-sustainment reimbursement rate of $5 per person per month (see para. 6 below). Additionally, provision of $99,200 is made for the recreational leave allowance at the standard rate of $10.50 per person per day for seven days for the first six months of service. Provision of $902,000 for the emplacement of military contingents is made on a full-cost basis and covers letters of assist ($830,000) and commercial air charter ($72,000) arrangements. A budgeted voluntary contribution in kind valued at $407,200 (2.5 million French francs) provided by the Government of France towards the deployment costs is reflected in line 21, budgeted voluntary contributions in kind, of annex I to the present report, resulting in the net requirements under this budget line item of $494,800. Owing to the short duration of the Mission’s present mandate, no provision is made at this time for the rotation of contingent personnel. 4. Rations. Provision for rations and bottled water is based on the mission-specific costs indicated in section A of the present annex and covers 350 military and 203 civilian personnel (179 international and local staff and 24 police officers, bottled water only). Owing to high temperatures and humidity associated with the rainy season, increased provision of 4.5 litres of bottled water per person per day is made from 15 May 1998 to prevent heat exhaustion and dehydration. At the request of troop-contributing countries that arrangements established under MISAB for the feeding of military contingents be continued, provision is made for the disbursement of food and bottled water allowance to 1,000 troops at $11.04 per person per day for 77,000 person-days for the period up to 30 June 1998 ($850,100) and for 153,000 person-days for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 ($1,689,100). 5. Contingent-owned equipment. Based on negotiations currently being conducted with the troop-contributing countries, provision under this heading reflects the implementation in MINURCA of the new contingent-owned equipment reimbursement procedures endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 50/222 of 11 April 1996. The costs associated with major equipment are calculated on a full-cost basis using the standard wet-lease reimbursement rates and are estimated at $1,171,600 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $1,955,500 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. The estimate takes into account the environmental and hostile action/forced abandonment factors of 0.9 and 1.7 per cent respectively. The budgeted voluntary contribution from the Government of France consisting of the waiver of the dry-lease reimbursement costs is estimated at $407,300 for the period up to 30 June 1998 and $814,500 for the subsequent period from 1 July to 30 November 1998, resulting in the net requirements under this budget line item of $763,700 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $1,141,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 June 1998. The voluntary contribution is reported in line 21, budgeted voluntary contributions in kind, of annexes I and II. Additionally, for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998, provision of $104,000 is made for the application of the United Nations markings and for the painting of the contingent-owned vehicles and trailers. 6. The estimated requirements for self-sustainment are reflected under the appropriate budget line items as shown in the following table. Requirements for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 indicated in the table take into account the delayed deployment of one contingent. Requirements for self-sustainment costs for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and from 1 July to 30 November 1998 Category 15 April to 30 June 1 July to 30 November Maintenance services (premises/accommodation) Construction/prefabricated buildings (accommodation and catering Contractual services (laundry and cleaning) 7. The Government of France has offered to waive the standard medical services self-sustainment rate of $76.75 per person per month and to provide medical and dental services (a level-2 medical facility) and medical consumables, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, blood and blood products to all MINURCA international civilian and military personnel at a flat rate of $35 per person per month. The resulting difference between the cost of services based on standard rates and those provided by the Government of France is treated as a voluntary contribution in kind. This contribution is valued at $152,900 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $323,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 and is reported in line 21, budgeted voluntary contributions in kind, of annexes I and II to the present report (see also paragraph 40 below). 8. Death and disability compensation. Provision of $111,300 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $229,000 for the subsequent period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 is based on the average annual cost of $40,000 applied to 1 per cent of the average monthly strength of military contingents and civilian police prorated for the respective budget periods. 9. Civilian police. Provision for civilian police is based on the mission-specific rates indicated in section A of the present annex on the assumption of the full deployment of 24 police officers from 15 May 1998. The requirements are estimated at $208,200 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $461,500 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 10. International and local staff salaries. Provision for salaries of internationally recruited staff is made on the basis of the 1998 standard cost rates for New York, and local salaries reflect the scale currently applicable in the mission area. Professional staff salaries have been adjusted to reflect the salary structure of 40 per cent of international staff classified as mission appointees, who are not entitled to post adjustment. For the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998, the cost estimates take into account the projected 15 and 10 per cent delayed recruitment factor for international and local staff, respectively. For the subsequent period from 1 July to 30 November 1998, the 5 per cent vacancy factor for international and local staff has been factored in. The proposed staffing table is shown in annex V. 11. As indicated in paragraph 4 of the annex to the report of the Secretary-General of 23 February 1998 (S/1998/148), in order to ensure optimal coordination, the United Nations Resident Coordinator/United Nations Development Programme Resident Representative would concurrently serve as Director of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. Accordingly, salary costs related to this position are not reflected in the Mission’s proposed budget. 12. Overtime. Provision under this heading covers the projected requirements during peak workload periods and is calculated at 5 per cent of local staff salaries. 13. Mission subsistence allowance. Provision under this heading is based on the mission-specific costs indicated in section A of the present annex and reflects the projected vacancy rates indicated in paragraph 10 above. The requirements are estimated at $826,000 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $1,903,500 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 14. Other travel costs. Provision for travel and subsistence expenses is made as follows: (a) Initial mandate period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 ($39,000): (i) Travel of Head of Mission and senior staff to United Nations Headquarters in New York for briefings and political consultations, $25,800 (three trips at $8,600 per trip for 10 days each including travel time); (ii) Travel of Political Affairs Officer from Headquarters to mission area, $7,300 (one trip for 15 days including travel time); (iii) Mission area travel for political consultations and administrative and logistics purposes, $5,900 (three trips for five days each). (b) Subsequent period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 ($95,500): (i) Travel of Head of Mission and senior staff to United Nations Headquarters in New York for briefings and political consultations, $34,400 (four trips at $8,600 per trip for 10 days each including travel time); (ii) Mission area travel for political consultations and administrative and logistics purposes, $12,100 (six trips for five days each); (iii) Internal audit travel, $16,000 (two auditors for 21 days each at $8,000 each); (iv) Medical visit travel, $6,600 (one Medical Officer for 10 days); (v) Logistical assistance travel, including travel in connection with the implementation of the Field Assets Control System, $26,400 (four logistics personnel for 10 days each at $6,600 per trip). 15. Government-provided personnel. Provision under this heading is made for travel and subsistence allowance of training assistance teams (11 training specialists) made available by the Government of Canada to conduct United Nations peacekeeping training programmes for the ex-MISAB contingents. The requirements are estimated at $11,200 (two training specialists for seven days each) for the period up to 30 June 1998 and $51,500 (nine training specialists for seven days each) for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 16. Rental of premises. Estimated requirements under this heading take into account the agreement by the Government of the Central African Republic to provide to MINURCA office and accommodation facilities on a no-cost basis. The Mission’s civilian and force headquarters, contingent living quarters (330 personnel), infirmary and warehouses would be located in the government-provided Camp Beal. Camp M’poko will house civilian administrative offices and contingent living quarters (335 personnel). The remaining military personnel (685) would be housed at nine various locations in the capital city of Bangui. The estimate is based on the mission-specific rates indicated in section A of the present annex and amounts to $61,000 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $112,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 17. Alteration and renovation of premises. Provision of $697,500 indicated in section B of the present annex is made for the renovation and upgrading of premises in order to meet the established United Nations accommodation standards. Of that provision, $70,000 is the estimated cost for the rehabilitation of infrastructure in Camp Beal, which sustained serious hurricane-inflicted damage in early April 1998. 18. Maintenance supplies. Based on the mission-specific rates indicated in section A of the present annex, requirements for maintenance supplies are estimated at $22,500 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $45,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 19. Maintenance services. Provision under this heading is based on the mission-specific rates indicated in section A of the present annex. Additionally, as indicated in paragraph 6 above, provision is made at the established self-sustainment rates for the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for minor construction, maintenance and light repair work. The total requirements under this heading are estimated at $33,200 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $69,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 20. Utilities. Provision for utilities is based on current rates and past consumption patterns in MISAB and on the average daily consumption of 7,500 litres of diesel fuel for generators at $0.3535 per litre. The back-up power generation capacity is required to provide electricity to the Mission’s accommodation, office, engineering and workshop facilities (the power supply reliability in the capital city of Bangui is estimated at 65 per cent). The requirements are estimated at $286,500 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $573,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 21. Construction/prefabricated buildings. As indicated in section B of the present annex, provision of $11,300 is made for the shipping of softwall storage facilities available from stock. Additionally, as indicated in paragraph 6 above, provision is made at the established self-sustainment rates for the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for the accommodation and kitchen facilities and equipment. The requirements are estimated at $118,200 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $226,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 22. Infrastructure repairs. Provision is made for the one-time cost of upgrading the access roads to the Mission’s headquarters ($10,000) and for the upkeep of the United Nations-contracted aircraft parking space and maintenance of access roads at the rates indicated in section A of the present annex. The total requirements are estimated at $20,000 each for the periods from 15 April to 30 June and from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 23. Purchase of vehicles. Owing to the non-availability of vehicles for commercial hire in the mission area and in view of procurement lead times, in order to meet the Mission’s operational requirements for the initial period, provision of $507,300 is made for the transfer of 83 vehicles, including 20 reserve vehicles, from the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) (two sedans) and the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) (one sedan, 40 light utility vehicles, 25 light pick-up trucks and 15 minibuses). The ex-MONUA and ex-UNTAES vehicles were manufactured in 1993-1994 and have travelled an average of 120,000 kilometres each, thereby exceeding the standard write-off requirements. For that reason, the 20 reserve vehicles would be required in order to maintain through vehicle replacement a vehicle availability rate of 90 per cent. The entire fleet of used vehicles would be written off upon delivery of replacement vehicles, anticipated by 1 October 1998). Accordingly, provision of $1,183,300, inclusive of freight, is made for the acquisition of vehicles as described in section B of the present annex. The proposed vehicle establishment for MINURCA is shown in annex VI, representing a 1:2.5 passenger vehicle to international civilian staff ratio. 24. Rental of vehicles. The concept of operations for the Mission’s military component calls for 30 wheeled armoured personnel carriers. Since troop-contributing countries indicated non-availability of the required vehicles from the national military stocks, provision is made for the commercial lease of 30 armoured personnel carriers beginning 1 June 1998 at a monthly rate of $7,500 per vehicle inclusive of maintenance costs and spare parts. The requirements for the commercial lease are estimated at $225,000 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $1,125,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 25. Spare parts, repairs and maintenance. Provision of $78,800 for the period from 15 April to 30 June and $157,500 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 under this heading is based on the standard monthly rate of $500 per vehicle for 63 vehicles (excluding reserve vehicles). 26. Petrol, oil and lubricants. Provision under this heading is based on the mission-specific rates indicated in section A of the present annex. The requirements are estimated at $235,000 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $470,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 27. Vehicle insurance. As detailed in section A of the present annex, provision under this heading is based on the worldwide third-party liability insurance premium rates in effect from 1 July 1997. The requirements are estimated at $9,100 for the period from 15 April to 30 June and $49,500 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 28. Air operations. The proposed configuration of the Mission’s aircraft fleet includes two medium-utility helicopters required for logistical support and medical evacuation, one heavy passenger/cargo fixed-wing aircraft for supply/resupply tasking, including flights beyond the mission area, and one light command and liaison fixed-wing aircraft also suited for medical and casualty evacuations to hospitals in neighbouring countries. With the Central African Republic being a landlocked country, and given the poor road infrastructure and acute shortage of commercial surface transportation means, a substantial part of the Mission’s logistical support would be routed through the nearest seaport, Douala, Cameroon, and moved by air to Bangui. Therefore, adequate air support would be essential for the fulfilment of the Mission’s mandate. Provision under this heading is based on the mission-specific rates indicated in section A and non-recurrent costs for positioning/depositioning and painting/preparation shown in section B of the present annex. The contractual arrangements for the long-term charter of aircraft would be in effect from 1 May 1998 for fixed-wing aircraft and from 1 June and 1 July 1998 respectively for the two helicopters. 29. Helicopter operations. For the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998, the requirements are estimated at $68,000 for hire/charter costs, $17,700 for aviation fuel and lubricants, $160,000 for positioning/depositioning, $20,000 for painting/preparation and $200 for third-party liability insurance. For the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998, the requirements are estimated at $680,000 for hire/charter costs, $177,000 for aviation fuel and lubricants and $1,500 for third-party liability insurance. 30. Fixed-wing aircraft. For the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998, the requirements are estimated at $663,000 for hire/charter costs, $174,600 for aviation fuel and lubricants, $67,000 for positioning/depositioning, $500 for painting/preparation and $1,000 for third-party liability insurance. For the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998, the requirements are estimated at $1,657,500 for hire/charter costs, $436,500 for aviation fuel and lubricants and $2,500 for third-party liability insurance. 31. Aircrew subsistence allowance. Provision under this heading covers meals and accommodation allowance payable to the crew of the heavy cargo aircraft on supply/ resupply flights to destinations in Europe and Africa at the rates indicated in section A of the present annex. Additionally, provision is made to cover the cost of meals, lodging and transportation provided to all aircraft crews in the mission area. Requirements for the period from 15 April to 30 June are estimated at $126,800 and for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 at $436,000. 32. Other air operation costs. Provision under this heading covers landing fees and ground handling at airports in Europe and Africa at the rates indicated in section A of the present annex. The requirements for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 are estimated at $20,000 (11 flights) and for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 at $22,000 (22 flights). 33. Acquisition of equipment. As described in section B of the present annex, requirements for equipment would be met, to the extent possible, from the available stocks and from the start-up kits assembled at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy. In accordance with the proposals contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the Base of 21 May 1997 (A/51/905, para. 20), the full cost of replacing all of the matériel issued from start-up kits would be charged to the Mission’s budget. This “replenishment” action would be in accordance with the self-funding principle proposed in the report, and would allow the Base to maintain the viability of the mission start-up kits. It will be recalled in this connection that the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in its report dated 30 September 1997 (A/52/407, para. 5), indicated that it had no objection to the Secretary-General’s funding proposals in respect of the Base. Requirements for the replenishment of start-up kits total $528,000, inclusive of freight at the standard rate of 15 per cent of the equipment value, are as follows: communications, workshop and test equipment, $262,800, office equipment, $56,900, and data-processing equipment, $208,300. As detailed in section B of the present annex, provision is also made for the acquisition of additional equipment not available from start-up kits and United Nations stocks. 34. Naval operations. Provision under this heading is made for fuel for the five contingent-provided motorized patrol boats at the consumption rates indicated in section A of the present annex. The requirements are estimated at $500 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $1,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 35. Communications. Provision under this heading covers non-recurrent costs contained in section B of the present annex and recurrent requirements indicated in paragraph 6 above for the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for communications equipment provided under self-sustainment arrangements. Requirements under the communications equipment budget line item are estimated at $1,158,000 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $310,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. Based on the mission-specific rates indicated in section A of the present annex, requirements for spare parts, repair and maintenance of United Nations-owned equipment are estimated at $44,800 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $89,500 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998, while requirements for commercial communications amount to $86,300 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $172,500 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 36. Other equipment. Information on the proposed acquisition of equipment is provided in section B of the present annex and, in respect of start-up kits, in paragraph 33 above. Provision for spare parts, repairs and maintenance is based on the standard rate of 7.5 per cent of the total value of equipment ($10,300 monthly) except for generators, for which requirements are estimated at $16,500 per month. Additionally, as indicated in paragraph 6 above, provision is made at the established self-sustainment rates for the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for office and observation equipment. 37. Audit services. Provision of $59,500 covers requirements for the external audit of MINURCA. 38. Contractual services. Provision under this heading is based on the estimated monthly cost of $24,200 and covers catering services, garbage collection and removal, liquid waste disposal, cleaning of premises, rodent and pest control, anti-termite treatment, mosquito eradication and grounds maintenance. Additionally, as indicated in paragraph 6 above, provision is made at the established self-sustainment rates for the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for laundry and cleaning services. The total requirements are estimated at $130,500 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $268,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 39. Data-processing services. Provision of $2,500 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $5,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 is based on the estimated monthly cost of $1,000 and covers software maintenance and licence fees. 40. Medical treatment and services. Provision under this heading covers medical contingencies requiring hospitalization and referral to outside medical facilities at the estimated monthly cost of $6,000. Additionally, as indicated in paragraphs 6 and 7 above, provision is made on a full-cost basis at the established self-sustainment rates for medical supplies and services for all military and international civilian personnel. The total requirements are estimated, on a full-cost basis, at $291,800 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $611,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. The net requirements are estimated at $138,900 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $288,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998. 41. Claims and adjustments. Provision of $5,000 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $10,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 is based on the estimated monthly cost of $2,000. 42. Official hospitality. Provision of $1,000 for the period from 15 April to 30 June 1998 and $2,000 for the period from 1 July to 30 November 1998 is based on the estimated monthly cost of $400. 43. Miscellaneous other services.
