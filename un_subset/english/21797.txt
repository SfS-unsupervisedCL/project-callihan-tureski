Fifty-eighth session Agenda items 155 and 121 Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 Reports of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.6/58/L.18 Fourteenth report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the statement submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.6/58/L.18 (A/C.5/58/18). 2. As indicated in the statement by the Secretary-General, under the terms of operative paragraphs 2, 7 and 8 of the draft resolution, the General Assembly would decide that the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization should hold its next session from 29 March to 8 April 2004; commend the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to reduce the backlog in the publication of the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs and endorse the efforts of the Secretary-General to eliminate the backlog in the publication of the Repertoire of the Practice of the Security Council; and encourage the Secretary-General in his continuous efforts to eliminate the backlog in the Repertory and the Repertoire, including by exploring options involving cooperation with academic institutions as a means to achieve this aim without prejudice to the continuation of their timely publication. 3. The Advisory Committee notes that the conference-servicing requirements for the nine-day session of the Special Committee referred to in operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution are estimated at $275,714 and that the meeting has already been programmed into the calendar of conferences. No additional appropriation is therefore required (A/C.5/58/18, para. 11). 4. As concerns operative paragraphs 7 and 8 of the draft resolution, the Advisory Committee recalls that, in action 10 (d) of his report entitled "Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change" (A/57/387 and Corr.1), the Secretary-General stated that the Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs should no longer be produced by the United Nations. Accordingly, no provision was included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 for that purpose. Adoption of the draft resolution would consequently entail additional requirements under sections 2, General Assembly affairs and conference services; 3, Political Affairs; 4, Disarmament; 5, Peacekeeping operations; 8, Legal affairs; 9, Economic and social affairs; 24, Human rights; 29B, Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts; and 29C, Office of Human Resources Management. 5. In his statement, the Secretary-General estimates that adoption of the draft resolution would give rise to total additional resource requirements for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 in respect of the Repertory of Practice amounting to $2,357,600. A breakdown of requirements by section of the proposed programme budget is given in paragraph 10 of the statement by the Secretary-General. 6. The Advisory Committee encourages the Secretariat to make greater use of the Internet to disseminate the Repertory of Practice, thereby speeding access to the publication and possibly reducing printing costs. In this connection, the Advisory Committee understands that there remains a reliance on hard copies of the Repertory. 7. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that, should it adopt draft resolution A/C.6/58/L.18, an additional appropriation of $2,357,600 would be required in the proposed programme budget for 2004-2005, as follows: section 2, General Assembly affairs and conference services, $590,100; section 3, Political affairs, $178,300; section 4, Disarmament, $30,000; section 5, Peacekeeping operations, $383,300; section 8, Legal affairs, $82,500; section 9, Economic and social affairs, $560,900; section 24, Human rights, $410,900; section 29B, Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, $55,500; and section 29C, Office of Human Resources Management, $66,100. Under the procedures established by the General Assembly in its resolutions 41/213 and 42/211, those provisions would represent a charge against the contingency fund. 8. The Advisory Committee was informed that the potential charges against the contingency fund for the biennium 2004-2005 as at 24 November 2003 (see annex) exceeded the level approved by the General Assembly for the contingency fund for the biennium 2004-2005, namely $21.6 million (see Assembly resolution 57/280). Therefore, in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Assembly for the operation of the fund, the Secretary-General should make proposals, in his consolidated statement of programme budget implications and revised estimates for the current session of the Assembly, for revising the consolidated amount so that it will not exceed the available balance (Assembly resolution 42/211, annex, para. 6). The Advisory Committee will revert to this matter in the context of its consideration of the consolidated statement.
