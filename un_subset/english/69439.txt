United Nations Children's Fund Executive Board Second regular session 2013 3-6 September 2013 * E/ICEF/2013/19. Item 4 of the provisional agenda* Annex: Supporting document to the UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2014-2017 Summary The present document contains tables that summarize the results and key performance indicators for the UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2014-2017, further to the Integrated Results and Resources Framework outlined in document E/ICEF/2013/16. The present document is presented to the Executive Board for action alongside the UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2014-2017 (E/ICEF/2013/21), which contains a draft decision. Page I. Results and key performance indicators Programme impacts: Realizing the rights of every child, especially the most disadvantaged, including indicators by outcome Outcome 1: Health Outcome 2: HIV and AIDS Outcome 3: Water, sanitation, hygiene Outcome 4: Nutrition Outcome 5: Education Outcome 6: Child protection Outcome 7: Social inclusion II. Organizational efficiency and effectiveness 1. UNICEF will develop guidance on the technical details of each indicator (including setting standards for `functional', `quality', etc.) to promote consistency in monitoring and reporting. Outcome and output indicators, when relevant to the country programme, will be reported as a number or percentage based on the result, and where possible they will also be reported by the number of children reached. For humanitarian situations, UNICEF will report on the number of people reached in areas targeted with UNICEF assistance at the output level. Estimating baselines for humanitarian situations at the outcome and output level is not possible since baselines depend on the humanitarian situations that may arise. The number of countries that meet country-defined targets for each humanitarian situation will be reported. 2. The status of disadvantaged populations, including information disaggregated by sex and the status of the poorest quintile, will be reported separately to the extent possible. Additional disaggregation -- such as by ethnicity, subnational area, disability or other characteristic -- will be collected and analysed at the national level as appropriate. 3. A comprehensive analysis of the risks, assumptions and mitigation measures for all outcomes and outputs will be outlined in a supplementary programme note that will accompany the Strategic Plan and will be publicly available. 4. The updated status of indicators will be reported globally each year, and support will be provided to strengthen monitoring systems in countries to generate the required information. For indicators that rely on nationally representative household surveys, the status at the country level will be updated every three to five years on average. Additional indicators will also be aggregated and reported in a `data companion' that will be developed each year and will accompany the annual report of the Executive Director of UNICEF. The data companion will aggregate the status of commonly used indicators from all relevant country programmes on the completion of key activities (e.g., training completed, supplies provided).
