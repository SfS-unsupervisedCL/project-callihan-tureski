Letter dated 13 September 2004 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to refer to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which assumed authority from the Multinational Interim Force in Haiti on 1 June 2004. Further to my letter of 27 May, I would like to inform you that, following the usual consultations, it is my intention to add the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Guatemala, the Kingdom of Morocco and Spain to the list of countries which have agreed to provide military personnel to MINUSTAH. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Kofi A. Annan
