Letter dated 22 February 2013 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council I wish to bring the attention of the Security Council to the fact that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has submitted, pursuant to article IV of the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, information on the object launched into space on 12 December 2012. In accordance with my obligations under article III of the Convention, I have registered that information, which has been circulated to Member States in document ST/SG/SER.E/662. I note that, in its resolution 2087 (2013), the Security Council condemned the launch by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of 12 December 2012, which used ballistic missile technology and was in violation of resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009). I wish to share with the Security Council my understanding that, as a technical procedure under the above Convention, the act of registration does not confer legality or legitimacy to the launch of 12 December 2012. I should be grateful if you would bring the present letter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) BAN Ki-moon
