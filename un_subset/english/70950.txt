Conclusions and/or recommendations 121 - 123 13 Annex Composition of the delegation 25 Introduction The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eighteenth session from 27 January to 7 February 2014. The review of Chile was held at the 3rd meeting on 28 January 2014. The delegation of Chile was headed by Bruno Baranda, Minister of Social Development. At its 10th meeting held on 31 January 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Chile. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Chile: Cuba, Montenegro and Pakistan. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Chile: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/CHL/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/CHL/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/CHL/3). A list of questions prepared in advance by Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Chile through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review The delegation considered that the universal periodic review marked a major step forward towards the universalization of human rights. Chile attributed a high priority to the implementation of its recommendations. The national report showed the progress that had been made in fulfilment of the recommendations received in 2009. Various ministries and public services participated in the preparation of the report. Those institutions were also represented on the high-level delegation that travelled to Geneva for the review. Meetings were also held with the national institute of human rights and with representatives of civil society for the preparation of the report. OHCHR also provided valuable assistance. In 2009, Chile had accepted 71 recommendations. Most of them had been implemented or were under implementation. Even though there were remaining challenges, the second report focused on the efforts made by the State to modernize and strengthen the human rights institutional infrastructure. The delegation highlighted some of the most relevant human rights measures undertaken in the last four and a half years, which were covered by the recommendations accepted in 2009. In 2009, Chile had ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances (CPED). The National Institute for Human Rights had also been established in 2009. It had been accorded "A" status in 2012, constituting the backbone of the institutional improvement of human rights in Chile. Regarding discrimination, Law No. 20.609 had entered into force in July 2012. The law punished all forms of discrimination based, inter alia, on grounds of race, nationality, language, political opinion, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. Chile was aware of its historical debt towards its indigenous peoples. The Government had therefore established a policy in 2010 to open a dialogue with the nine indigenous peoples present in the country, in order to ensure their access to development opportunities, with full respect for their rights, traditions, identity and culture. The need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach had led to the creation of the Council of Ministers for Indigenous Affairs. The implementation of international Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries had deepened the commitment to indigenous communities regarding participation and involvement. Since its entry into force, more than 43 consultations had been carried out on matters related to draft legislation, administrative measures and investment projects. One of the most relevant consultations had involved discussion of the procedure and stages of future consultations. During nearly three years, over 300 workshops, involving a direct dialogue between government authorities and indigenous leaders, had been conducted. Having established the new consultation procedure, the Government would apply this mechanism in relation to three relevant issues: the constitutional recognition of the indigenous peoples, the creation of a council representing them and the design of a new institutional framework for a more efficient implementation of public policies regarding them. During the examination, the delegation acknowledged the questions put forward by various countries, which would be answered during the course of the review. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review During the interactive dialogue, 84 delegations made statements.

It made recommendations. Colombia commended Chile on the strengthening of its institutions, the ratification of the Rome Statute, the adoption of the Anti-Discrimination Act and its role in the Human Rights Council. It made recommendations. The Delegation of Chile emphasized that the new anti-discrimination legislation (Law No. 20.609) was a milestone and the first regulation explicitly punishing acts of discrimination. In compliance with this law, a non-discrimination policy had been recently approved in order to protect and promote human rights without any discrimination. Its implementation was safeguarded by the Observatory on Citizen Participation and Non-Discrimination. The Human Rights Department of the police (Carabineros) had been set up in 2011 with the aim of, inter alia, promoting human rights within its domain and contributing to training on human rights. The Department had updated several police protocols on the use of force and firearms. In 2013, the unit for education, doctrine and the history of the police had implemented a new human rights training programme, in accordance with relevant international standards, on the use of force and the protection of vulnerable groups, including the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population. In 2012, the tactics of the Carabineros for the maintenance of public order had been updated and a new model for the use of force established, based on the universal principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. In 2013, several protocols on police intervention had been reviewed in order to protect the right to freedom of assembly. The National Institute for Human Rights had supervised interventions by the police during public demonstrations, including the conditions of detention inside police vehicles and in 2012 the Internal Affairs Department had been placed under the General Inspectorate, with the aim of strengthening the internal supervision and control of the Carabineros. Likewise, the people affected by police behaviour had been afforded the possibility to access an Internet complaints system. The delegation reiterated its permanent commitment to human rights when applying the anti-terrorist legislation (Law No. 18.314), which had been amended numerous times since the return to democracy, in order to restrict its scope of application. The delegation emphasized that this legislation had been implemented without any discrimination. Turning to criminal legislation, the delegation stressed that a new draft of the Penal Code would soon be presented to Parliament, which would involve the derogation of article 373 of the Code. The delegation reported that, in 2010, an amendment to the military justice system had been adopted, limiting the scope of military jurisdiction, so that only military personnel could be brought to trial by military courts. It noted, however, that this was an ongoing review process. Regarding the right to land of indigenous peoples, in the last three years, the Government had returned more than 49,360 hectares to indigenous peoples, estimating that 100 per cent of the land currently being claimed would be returned to them within the next six years. The Government had focused not only on the restitution of land as such, but had also complemented it with a productive development strategy, by providing financial and human resources and technical assistance, and in particular investing resources in water management. Despite the fact that a full consensus had not been reached on certain areas of the consultation process with indigenous peoples, the relevant aspects of the procedures, subjects, stages and deadlines had been agreed. The new regulation would enter into force soon, which was a step forward. It would be different to the current regulation, in that it would not only be the right to land which would be the subject of consultations. Consequently, indigenous people, whose traditions, customs and religious, cultural and spiritual practices had been affected, would also be entitled to a prior consultation process. Likewise, the current regulation on the assessment of environmental impact - in force since December 2013 - also incorporated special provisions for consultation when an investment project had an impact on indigenous peoples, rather than on the environment. The delegation noted that the Amnesty Law, although still formally in force, had not been used by the courts since 1998. Currently, more than 1,000 legal proceedings pertaining to human rights violations were ongoing and the Ministry of Interior was a prosecutorial party in 800 of them. Additionally, since 2012, the Supreme Court had decided to stay the use of the statute of limitations in cases of serious, massive and systematic violations of human rights perpetrated during the dictatorship. The Government had established several programmes of reparation for victims who qualified for them: inter alia, pensions for the spouses, mothers, fathers or children of victims, bonuses and scholarships for the children of victims and exemption from compulsory military service. Also, on the fortieth anniversary of the military coup, the Government had ordered the closure of a detention centre used exclusively by former members of the security forces. In recent decades, Chile had become a major destination of international migration. To facilitate the integration of the immigrant community, the Government had encouraged a process of regularization. Moreover, in 2010 the Refugee Protection Act had been adopted, incorporating the international commitments undertaken by Chile. In 2011, a law defining the smuggling of migrants and trafficking of persons as a crime had been enacted and in 2013, a bill on immigration had been sent to parliament after an extensive process of consultation between the State and civil society. That bill, which should be adopted without delay, would replace the Immigration Act of 1975. Chile was about to establish the office of the undersecretary for human rights. A bill was in its second legislative process in the Chamber of Deputies. Once established, the office would be able to draw up a national human rights plan, fulfilling that commitment. As for the national mechanism for the prevention of torture, the Government had been working with the National Institute for Human Rights in order to implement it as swiftly as possible. In addition, the draft of the Penal Code that the executive branch would submit in March 2014 would incorporate a definition of the crime of torture. The fight against domestic violence had been a priority for Chile. In 2010, the law that defines femicide as a crime had been approved, increasing the penalties for former spouses and partners of the victims. The programme "Chile acoge" ("Chile embraces") sought to reduce violence against women by paying more attention to the victims and to prevention in children and adolescents. It also included the rehabilitation of men who used violence against their partners and the protection of women who suffered sexual violence or had been victims of the crime of trafficking. In this context, the number of femicides had been reduced from 57 cases in 2008 to 34 in 2012 and 40 in 2013. The State promoted the reconciliation of family obligations and work responsibilities, as well as the sharing of responsibilities between parents in the care of children, so that women would have more opportunities for work and personal development. Some of the policies worth mentioning that had been implemented were the extension of postnatal leave from three to six months, the law establishing the shared care of children and the increased coverage of day care and preschool education by over 100,000 places. In addition, 54 per cent of the 840,000 jobs created in the past four years were for women; the rate of female labour participation had reached 48 per cent and the female unemployment rate had decreased to a historical low, from 10.3 per cent in 2009 to 6.2 per cent in 2013. Regarding abortion, the Constitution protected the life of the unborn, so that any action to terminate a pregnancy was prohibited and punished. However, in exceptional instances, where the mother's life was in danger, the law allowed physicians to perform treatments that were necessary to save the life of the mother, even when the life or integrity of the child was affected as a necessary and secondary consequence. Chile had promoted various initiatives to improve conditions for persons deprived of their liberty. A first step was a plan of 11 measures, which included a significant investment to address problems of infrastructure, security, housing and health. Hence, overcrowding in prisons had been reduced to 25 per cent in 2013. Since 8.7 per cent of the prison population was female, the Government had developed a prison policy with a gender perspective. The delegation concluded by thanking those delegations which had intervened; opinions, recommendations and constructive criticism were invaluable for assessing progress and challenges in the promotion and protection of human rights in Chile. The delegation sought to answer as many questions as possible and pledged to respond in writing to those that had not been addressed for lack of time. Chile had made progress in building a culture of respect, promotion and protection of human rights but major challenges remained. The Government took them seriously and, in this context, acknowledged the importance of the universal periodic review mechanism and the recommendations derived from it, being aware that they would contribute to a more just and equitable society.
