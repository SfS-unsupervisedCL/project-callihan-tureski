Political situation 4. NATO Heads of State and Government met in Bucharest from 2 to 4 April 2008. The Summit declaration reiterates the commitment of NATO to stay the course in Kosovo under Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), as well as its readiness to play its part in the implementation of future security arrangements in Kosovo. Security situation 5. On 1 April 2008, an explosion resulting from a landmine detonation occurred near Pristina Airport, killing one Kosovo Albanian. 6. On 2 April 2008, the first Russian aircraft loaded with humanitarian aid for Kosovo Serbs landed in Belgrade. Three more similar aircraft arrived successively on 4, 6 and 10 April 2008. On 22 April 2008, three Serbian Red Cross trucks carrying Russian humanitarian food and medical supplies escorted by one United Nations vehicle entered Kosovo via Gate 3 Podujevo, and unloaded the aid items in various Serb enclaves, including Gracanica, Lipljan, Plamentina, Strpce and Mitrovica. On 30 April 2008, four more trucks transporting the latest shipment of Russian humanitarian aid entered Kosovo. All trucks left Kosovo via Gate 1. 7. The former Prime Minister of Kosovo and ex-KLA commander, Ramush Haradinaj, was acquitted by the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia on 3 April 2008. Between 150 and 1,000 Kosovo-Albanian supporters celebrated the verdict in Istok, Pec, Decani, Cabra, Pristina, Gnjilane, Vitina and Prizren. 8. On 5 April 2008, unknown suspects threw hand grenades at a Kosovo-Albanian house in South Mitrovica. No injuries were reported. 9. On 15 April 2008, a Serbian Ministry of the Interior patrol and an unknown number of Kosovo-Albanians were involved in a shooting incident in the vicinity of Gate 2 (Multinational Task Force Centre), most likely linked to illegal criminal activities on the Serbian side of the border. Serbian forces requested a joint KFOR/Serbian Armed Forces reconnaissance of the area on 16 April 2008. 10. On 20 April 2008, a hand grenade exploded in a Kosovo-Albanian kiosk in Pec. No injuries were reported. 11. On 22 April 2008, approximately 30 Muslim Albanian gravestones were damaged by unknown persons in Gnjilane. An investigation led by the Kosovo Police Service is ongoing. 12. The President of Serbia, Boris Tadic, visited Decani and Pec during Orthodox Easter on 26 April 2008. He entered Kosovo through Gate 3 escorted by United Nations vehicles. Together with the Serbian Minister for Kosovo and Metohija, Slobodan Samardzic, he attended an evening mass in Decani Monastery. 13. During the reporting period, there was no significant violence or threat against the Kosovo Force (KFOR). 14. A total of 497 incidents related to drugs (14), counterfeit currency or documents (46), smuggling (46), explosions (6), miscellaneous criminal incidents (107), illegal weapons possession (110), weapons and ammunition seizures (34), and unexploded ordnance (134) were reported during April, compared to a total of 474 in the previous month. KFOR operations 15. Although generally calm, the operational tempo remained high in the area of responsibility of Multinational Task Force North, where 17 KFOR manoeuvre companies were deployed. Daily demonstrations in North Mitrovica and in Serbian enclaves in the south continued without incident. KFOR conducted high-visibility operations throughout Kosovo. KFOR also continued to monitor visits by high-ranking Serbian officials to Kosovo. Open sources reported that, on 18 April 2008, paramilitary groups were patrolling a contested zone along the border with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, near the village of Debalde. In response, KFOR increased the number and frequency of its patrols along the Kosovo side of the border to deter non-compliant groups and smuggling activities. On 29 April 2008, the United Kingdom formally authorized the deployment of its Operational Reserve Force, scheduled to deploy on 29 May 2008 for a period of one month, replacing a German/Austrian Operational Reserve Force battalion that has been deployed since 15 March. Compliance 16. There was no meeting of the Disciplinary Board in April 2008 on compliance with the statement of principles of the KFOR Commander and UNMIK Regulation 1999/8. Kosovo Protection Corps 17. No recruitment campaign for the Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) was conducted in April 2008. 18. The current active personnel establishment is 2,878. There are 179 active ethnic minority members, amounting to 6.2 per cent of the total force. The total percentage of ethnic minority representation in KPC remains the same as in March 2008. The percentage of minority representation in KPC still falls short of the goal of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and there are still 113 vacant minority posts to be filled on the active list. The reserve list totals 2,000 positions, of which 1,892 are filled, 48 of these by ethnic minorities (2.45 per cent), the same figure as in March. 19. Fire-fighting training in April included a series of seminars at different levels; collective training exercises for KPC staff and units; simulation exercises; a command post exercise and a "table top" exercise in preparation for a Kosovo-wide exercise to be conducted from 26 to 30 May 2008. The latter is designed to practise and test emergency response measures in support of the civilian population in the event of an emergency. 20. During the month of April 2008, there were 17 ceremonies involving 245 KPC members. No incidents were reported. Conclusion 21. Since the violence of 17 March in Mitrovica North, the security situation has been calm in Kosovo. KFOR, however, remains on a high state of readiness and will continue to support UNMIK in maintaining a safe and secure environment throughout Kosovo. KFOR will respond adequately to any attempts to disrupt stability, regardless of where they come from.
