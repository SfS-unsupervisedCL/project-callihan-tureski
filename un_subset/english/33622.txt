Letter dated 15 March 2005 from the Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People addressed to the President of the Security Council In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, I have the honour to refer to the summary statement by the Secretary-General concerning the list items of which the Security Council is currently seized and on the stage reached in their consideration (S/2005/15). In this connection, I would like to reiterate the Committee's continuing objection to the deletion from the aforementioned list those items that relate to the exercise of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle East, which are of special concern not only to the Committee but also to the majority of Member States. The Committee believes that pending a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the core of which is the question of Palestine, in accordance with international legitimacy, these items should remain on the list of matters of which the Council is seized, as they continue to engage its primary responsibility with regard to the maintenance of international peace and security. Any decision to delete those items, especially at this critical point in international efforts to encourage the resumption of the peace process, would go well beyond procedural exercise and would have far-reaching political implications. On behalf of the Committee, I would like once again to express the firm hope that decisions of such fundamental importance will be taken in thorough consultation with all the parties concerned. I should be grateful if you would have the text of the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Paul Badji Chairman Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People
