CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT 1787 30 June 2006 Original: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 26 JUNE 2006 FROM THE MINISTER, PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE A.I. OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT TRANSMITTING THE LETTER OF THE AMBASSADOR, PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA TO THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICE AT GENEVA ADDRESSED TO MR. KOFI ANNAN, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS ON 23 JUNE 2006 I have the honour to transmit to you the letter of the Ambassador, Permanent Representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations on 23 June 2006. I would be grateful if you could issue and circulate this letter with the attached letter as an official document of the Conference on Disarmament. (Signed:) Kye Chun Yong Minister Permanent Representative a.i. of the DPRK Mission Mr. Kofi Annan Secretary-General United Nations New York Mr. Secretary-General, I present my compliments to you and hereby send this letter to you in respect of the statement you, Mr. Secretary-General, have addressed to the Plenary of the Conference on Disarmament on 21 June 2006. We read your statement several times and paid deep attention to its contents. In your statement, while mentioning the impasse on the Korean Peninsula, you have requested that "the leaders of the DPRK will listen to what the world is telling them." The United Nations and the international society know well the Korean issue characterized by a long history of national division imposed by the foreign forces and particularly, the origin of the nuclear issue being used as a tool to destroy the DPRK in the midst of post-cold war changes of the international relations. They also know well the sincere and serious efforts on the part of the DPRK to address the issue. We do not doubt that you, Mr. Secretary-General, are fully aware of what are the essence of and the stumbling block to the nuclear issue and what is to be done and how to resolve the issue fundamentally in a way of ensuring peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region. However, you have jumped to the conclusion as if the impasse and complication of the situation on the Korean peninsula are attributable to the DPRK. We can not but say that this is a unilateral pressure upon our country. This can not be construed otherwise than intentionally ignoring the essence of the matter directly related to the existence of one country, protecting the anyone's power politics and turning to the unfairness. The DPRK, a country subject to the constant threats from the outside, values the sovereignty and dignity above anything else. We defend our sovereignty and dignity and safeguard our peace and security even at the cost of our lives. The Delegation of the DPRK to the Conference on Disarmament rejects your statement made at the Conference on Disarmament. Since you have made open statement, we also make open response to the statement. Impartiality is the life and soul of the United Nations. The United Nations devoid of fairness will not be able to be called the United Nations desired by the international society. The DPRK, a full-fledged member of the United Nations, hopes that the United Nations as the most universal political international organization will be a fairest organization faithful to the purposes and principles enshrined in its Charter. With highest consideration. (Signed) Ri Tcheul Ambassador, Permanent Representative Head of Delegation to the Conference on Disarmament c.c.
