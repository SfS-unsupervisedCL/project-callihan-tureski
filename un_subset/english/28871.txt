Letter dated 8 January 2004 from the President of the General Assembly to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to bring to your attention herewith the contents of General Assembly resolution 58/275 of 23 December 2003, adopted under agenda items 120 entitled "Programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003", 121 entitled "Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005" and 161 entitled "Financing of the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire", as requested in paragraph 5 of that resolution. Attention is drawn in particular to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the aforementioned resolution, in which the General Assembly decided, as a provisional and exceptional measure, to finance the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire up to the expiration of its current mandate in accordance with the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations under the regular budget and also decided that the issue of the most appropriate funding for the Mission upon the renewal of its mandate should be considered by the Assembly at the first part of its resumed fifty-eighth session, in the context of established norms and practice. The Fifth Committee, to which this item has been allocated for consideration, is scheduled to hold its first resumed session from 8 March to 2 April 2004. (Signed) Julian R. Hunte President of the General Assembly
