Letter dated 5 May 2008 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council Further to my previous letters addressed to the Security Council regarding Chad's systematic violation of the Dakar Agreement between Chad and the Sudan, and of all other agreements previously signed by the two countries, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, on 30 April 2008, the Government of Chad, in continuation of its acts of destabilization, gave direct military aid to the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) in Darfur. This aid consisted of three large trucks loaded with military equipment, three fuel tankers and three Land Cruiser vehicles. The transport division of the Chadian military was observed delivering this aid in N'Djamena to Abdul Karim Tuli Quni, a JEM military leader. The continued and regular violation by our neighbour Chad of the Dakar Agreement, and all other agreements previously signed by the two countries, clearly reflects Chad's intention to use those leaders of the Darfurian factions who have rejected peace in order to impede efforts to reach a political settlement as well as to undermine the goal of lasting security and stability in Darfur. Finally, I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad Permanent Representative of the Republic of the Sudan to the United Nations
