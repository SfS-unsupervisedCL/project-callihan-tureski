Letter dated 14 May 2009 from the Permanent Representative of Somalia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to inform you that, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1846 (2008) and 1851 (2008), the Islamic Republic of Iran has decided to dispatch two naval vessels to the region off the coast of Somalia and the Gulf of Aden, affected by piracy, in order to carry out protective escorts and anti-piracy related operations. The Islamic Republic of Iran wishes to cooperate with the Somali Government in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, which is acceptable to the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia. In this regard, on behalf of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, I have the honour to inform you that we have given advance notification to the Secretary-General of the consent of the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia to permit the Islamic Republic of Iran to take action as requested. The Iranian naval vessels are expected to arrive in the region of operation on 15 May 2009 and are initially supposed to stay there until 21 October 2009. The said naval vessels will protect and escort the ships that are related to Iran or Iranian citizens and shipping companies and will assist other foreign vessels requesting help. I would highly appreciate your bringing the present letter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Elmi Ahmed Duale Ambassador Permanent Representative
