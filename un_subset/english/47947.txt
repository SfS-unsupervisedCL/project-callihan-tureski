Statement by the President of the Security Council At the 6017th meeting of the Security Council, held on 19 November 2008, in connection with the Council's consideration of the item entitled "Maintenance of international peace and security: strengthening collective security through general regulation and reduction of armaments", the President of the Security Council made the following statement on behalf of the Council: "The Security Council recalls its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security. "The Security Council remains convinced of the necessity to strengthen international peace and security through, inter alia, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control. It considers that the regulation and reduction of armaments and armed forces, as appropriate, constitutes one of the most important measures to promote international peace and security with the least diversion of the world's human and economic resources. "The Security Council notes the importance of collective security and its impact on disarmament and development, and stresses its concern at increasing global military expenditure. "The Security Council stresses the importance of appropriate levels of military expenditure, in order to achieve undiminished security for all at the lowest appropriate level of armaments. It urges all States to devote as many resources as possible to economic and social development, in particular in the fight against poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. "The Security Council affirms the 2005 World Summit Outcome in which Heads of State and Government recognized that development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. "The Security Council stresses the vital importance of an effective multilateral system, to better address, in accordance with international law, the multifaceted and interconnected challenges and threats confronting our world and to achieve progress in the areas of peace and security, development and human rights, which are the pillars of the United Nations system and the foundations for collective security and well-being. It also expresses its support for multilateralism as one of the most important means for resolving security concerns in accordance with international law. "The Security Council expresses support for national, bilateral, regional and multilateral measures adopted by governments aimed at reducing military expenditures, where appropriate, thereby contributing to strengthening regional and international peace and security. "The Security Council underlines the importance of promoting norms setting in accordance with international law, as part of the efforts to strengthen non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control measures, as well as the importance of compliance with and reinforcing of the existing agreements, conventions, and treaties which relate to these matters and international peace and security. "The Security Council reiterates that cooperation with regional and subregional organizations in matters relating to the maintenance of peace and security and consistent with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations can improve collective security and therefore should be continuously strengthened. In this regard, it underlines the importance of strengthening the capacity of such organizations in conflict prevention, crisis management, armaments control and in supporting States recovering from conflict and laying the foundation for sustainable peace and development. "The Security Council recalls the obligation of all States to accept and carry out its decisions in accordance with article 25 of the United Nations Charter and affirms its commitment to continue monitoring and promoting the effective implementation of its decisions, in order to avoid conflict, promote and maintain international peace and security and further confidence in collective security. "The Security Council calls on Member States, regional and subRegional organizations, the Secretariat and the competent United Nations Funds and Programs, as appropriate, to make further efforts to preserve, facilitate, develop and strengthen international and regional cooperation in the areas of arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament, through, inter alia, further implementation, development and strengthening of relevant agreements and instruments. "The Security Council intends to continue following this issue."
