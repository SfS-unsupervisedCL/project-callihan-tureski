United Nations DP/FPA/2005/8 Annual session 2005 13 to 24 June 2005, New York Item 17 of the provisional agenda Funding commitments to UNFPA UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO UNFPA: REPORT ON CONTRIBUTIONS BY MEMBER STATES TO REGULAR AND OTHER RESOURCES FOR 2005 AND FUTURE YEARS* Report of the Executive Director Introduction This report is prepared in response to Executive Board decisions 99/5 and 2000/9, which requested the Executive Director to provide annually updated estimates of regular resources and other resources from co-financing arrangements, in the multi-year funding framework (MYFF). Since the introduction of the multi-year funding format and the MYFF in 2000, UNFPA has been actively campaigning for, and receiving, pledges on a continuous basis, not only for the current year, but for future years as well. The present report follows on the report on contributions to UNFPA regular and other resources for 2004 and future years (DP/FPA/2004/10) that was submitted to the Executive Board at its annual session in 2004. The purpose of this report is to promote dialogue between UNFPA and its Executive Board on the Fund's overall resource situation while continuing to address the common and important goal of increasing regular resources and achieving a stable and predictable resource base. The report contains a number of tables and charts on UNFPA regular and other resources (from co-financing arrangements). Additional data are provided in the annexes. The donor income figures are stated on a cash basis and therefore are inclusive of exchange gains and losses. To be able to meet the schedule for submission of the report to the Executive Board for the 2005 annual session, the data for 2005 in this document are based on information received and pledges recorded as of 1 April 2005. It should be noted that 2004 figures are provisional. A. Income overview Table 1: UNFPA income, 2000 to 2005 as of 1 April 2005 (in millions of $) B. Factors affecting UNFPA income situation in 2005 Table 1 shows that the year 2004 was a notable year for UNFPA with total resources (regular and co-financing) reaching nearly $462.7 million, the Fund's highest total ever. The total income for UNFPA in 2004 was $331.6 million in regular resources and $131.1 million for co-financing arrangements. The increase in income for regular resources in 2004 from a level of $292.3 million in 2003 was $39.3 million or 13.4 per cent. The increase in income for co-financing arrangements from a level of $89.9 million in 2003 to $131.1 million in 2004 was $41.2 million or 45.8 per cent. The substantial increase in the 2004 regular income level to $331.6 million was due to larger contributions from nine major donors, namely, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom; as well as the impact of favourable exchange rates of the euro and other currencies against the US dollar. The increase in the 2004 co-financing income was due to larger contributions to the reproductive health commodity security trust fund, including from the Member States of the European Union and the European Commission. The projected increase in the 2005 regular income level to $360 million compared to $331.6 million in 2004 for regular resources is due to: (a) the impact of favourable exchange rates of the euro and other currencies against the US dollar; and (b) increased contributions in terms of national currencies from seven major donors. Australia increased its contribution by 8.7 per cent (13 per cent in US dollars). Canada, as part of its first ever multi-year commitment to a United Nations agency, increased its contribution by 9.5 per cent over 2004 (an estimated increase of 20.1 per cent in US dollars). Finland, as part of its multi-year commitment, increased its contribution by 5.2 per cent over 2004 (17.3 per cent in US dollars). France increased its contribution substantially by 104.9 per cent over 2004 (121 per cent in US dollars). Ireland increased its contribution by 15.0 per cent (20.9 per cent in US dollars). New Zealand, as part of its multi-year commitment, increased its contribution by 7 per cent (13.9 per cent in US dollars). Norway increased its contribution by 4.3 per cent (15.9 per cent in US dollars). Finally, Sweden increased its contribution substantially by 31.5 per cent (42.1 per cent in US dollars). The income overview in table 1 is supplemented by annex 3 and shows the preliminary 2005 forecast as of 1 April 2005. Based on official pledges already received and best estimates from other donors, the total contributions income projection for 2005 (regular and co-financing arrangements) amounts to approximately $440 million. This includes the regular contributions of $360 million and $80 million for co-financing arrangements. The latter estimate of $80 million is harder to predict due to the flexible nature of co-financing decisions. The Fund maintains its hope for a better result beyond the $100 million benchmark. The current 2005 forecast of $360 million in regular contributions is an increase of approximately $28.4 million (7.9 per cent) from the provisional 2004 level of $331.6 million. Early payments would help UNFPA to avoid cash flow difficulties and to ensure uninterrupted programme support. UNFPA would encourage all donors to provide pledges as early as possible. Vigorous advocacy efforts are under way to attract larger contributions from major countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Currently, four countries, namely, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and the United Kingdom account for about half of the UNFPA regular resources. UNFPA is therefore focusing its efforts to achieve financial stability, by maintaining its donor base, i.e., 166 donor governments in 2004, an increase of 17 donors from 2003, and securing a higher level of pledges for 2005 from those major donors who are in a position to do so. UNFPA is also trying to convince certain OECD countries that are contributing below the $1 million benchmark to become major donors, contributing at least $1 million. In recent years, Ireland, Luxembourg and New Zealand have become major donors to the Fund. The income overview provided in table 1 is supplemented by annex 1, which provides detailed information on 2004 income as of 31 December 2004, actual pledges and the best estimates of contributions to UNFPA regular resources for the years 2005 and future years as of 1 April 2005. These commitments include the following: (a) pledges received from Governments at the first UNFPA pledging event on multi-year funding, which took place during the second regular session of the Executive Board in 2000; (b) multi-year pledges received in 2005 and other pledges received for 2005 as of 1 April 2005; (c) pledges for 2005 received during the United Nations Pledging Conference for 2005, held on 6 November 2004; and (d) letters received and verbal indications from Governments pledging support to UNFPA for the period 2005 to 2008. As of 1 April 2005, a total of 83 countries have submitted written pledges to UNFPA for the year 2005. It should be noted that the balance of unpaid pledges is calculated using the United Nations operational rate of exchange effective 1 April 2005. C. Multi-year pledges for the period 2000 to 2005 Table 2: Number of donors that submitted multi-year pledges to UNFPA regular resources, by region, 2000 to 2005 Table 2 shows the multi-year pledges to UNFPA regular resources received by year from 2000 to 2005. In 2000, out of a total of 100 donors, 16 multi-year pledges were received and only three major donors (contributing US$1 million and over) were able to submit their pledges in this format, namely, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In 2001, out of a total of 121 donors, 27 multi-year pledges were received and only five major donors were able to submit pledges in this format, namely Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In 2002, out of a total of 136 donors, 30 multi-year pledges were received but only six major donors were able to submit their pledges in this format, namely, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In 2003, out of a total of 149 donors, 20 multi-year pledges were received but only one major donor, the Netherlands, was able to submit its pledge in this format. In 2004, out of a total of 166 donors, 49 multi-year pledges were received but only five major donors were able to submit their pledges in this format, namely, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. As of 1 April 2005, out of a total of 83 donors, 34 multi-year pledges were received but only five major donors were able to submit their pledges in this format. It is encouraging to note that the number of multi-year pledges received in 2004 increased by 135 per cent, from 20 to 49. It is unfortunate, however, that only five major donors have pledged in this format. Also, in 2004, the benchmark of 150 donor countries was surpassed and a total number of 166 donors contributed to UNFPA regular resources, a new record for UNFPA, and the highest number for any agency in the United Nations system. This is certainly a significant increase from 1999 when there were only 69 donors. This achievement can be attributed in no small part to the initiative shown by most of the programme countries, particularly in the Africa and Asia regions. However, to make the multi-year pledging format more meaningful, the number of major donors pledging in the multi-year format needs to increase. Details on the donors that submitted multi-year pledges to regular resources are presented in annex 2 of this report. UNFPA has joined the other United Nations funds and programmes, namely, UNDP, UNICEF and WFP, to jointly emphasize to its donors and its Executive Board, the importance of regular resources which constitute each agency's core programme funds. The funds and programmes have worked during the last several years under the direction and guidance of their respective Executive Boards, to put in place results-based management systems that strengthen effectiveness and efficiency in the use of regular resources for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). D. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development donors Table 3: OECD/DAC donors that may increase, maintain or reduce respective contributions to UNFPA regular resources for 2005, compared with 2004 (in national currency terms) Table 3 shows the following with regard to OECD contributions to UNFPA regular resources for 2004. As of 1 April 2005: Eight countries, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden increased their contributions from the 2004 level in terms of both national currency and US dollars; Seven countries, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are expected to maintain their contributions at the 2004 level in national currency terms. Due to the strength of the euro and other currencies, there are substantial increases in US dollar equivalent of the contributions of these countries; Two countries, Japan and Italy reduced their contributions. Additional details on OECD contributions to regular resources are presented in annex 4 and annex 5. Campaign to end fistula Since the launch of the campaign to end fistula, there has been a good response from the donor community, including contributions from the Governments of Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as from the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security. Additionally, support for the campaign has broadened to include individuals, foundations and the corporate sector. Virgin Unite, a charitable organization bringing together all 200 Virgin companies, and the London office of Young and Rubicam, a leading advertising agency, have agreed to provide in kind media and marketing support to raise awareness about the campaign to end fistula, thereby further increasing UNFPA visibility within the United Kingdom and encouraging support for the campaign among both the general public and policy makers. During 2004, the campaign mobilized $9.48 million bringing the total raised since the campaign's launch to $10.5 million. The generous support received from donors in 2004 enabled UNFPA to successfully support many countries in their efforts to prevent and treat fistula. Fistula puts a human face on reproductive health issues and provides an entry point for advocacy on broader issues of universal access to reproductive health services and gender equality. F. Thematic trust fund on reproductive health commodity security In October 2004, on the occasion of the General Assembly's commemoration of the tenth anniversary of ICPD, the Netherlands, as President of the European Union, announced on behalf of the European Union Member States a contribution of $75 million to UNFPA for reproductive health commodities. In response, UNFPA has set up a thematic trust fund on reproductive health commodity security, into which donors can channel and pool funding for reproductive health commodities. The donors that have already made commitments are Austria, Canada, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, the European Commission, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships (UNFIP). As of 1 April 2005, out of the total of $82.7 million in pledges, contributions of $40.7 million were paid. To date, the largest payment received was from the Netherlands in the amount of $33.8 million. Moreover, payments were received from Cyprus - $0.01 million; Denmark - $1.1 million; Estonia - $0.04 million; Finland - $1.3 million; Luxembourg - $0.5 million; Portugal - $0.3 million; Sweden - $2 million; Canada - $1.6 million; as well as a contribution in kind from the Czech Republic. G. UNFPA resources, 2003 - 2007 Table 4: UNFPA income for 2003 to 2004 and projections for 2005 to 2007 Table 4 summarizes the resource data for the period 2003 to 2007. For regular resources, income to UNFPA in 2004 increased by 13.4 per cent from the 2003 level. As of 1 April 2005, the projected regular income for 2005 is 8.6 per cent more than that in 2004. UNFPA anticipates that regular resources in 2005 will increase to approximately $360 million or higher, depending on the level of major donor support and the exchange rate fluctuations. Regular resources are also expected to increase by at least 2.5 per cent and reach the $360 million to $380 million range for both 2006 and 2007. The Fund will make every effort to increase income to the $400 million level. However, to accomplish this UNFPA needs the support and advocacy of its Executive Board members. This target is consistent with the regular resource requirements for the UNFPA MYFF for the period 2004 - 2007 in the amount of $1.4 billion. UNFPA regular resource requirements for 2004 - 2007, as contained in the MYFF report were estimated at $1.2 billion, and are now being revised, subject to Board endorsement, to $1.4 billion (see DP/FPA 2005/7, Part I). One way to increase regular resources to UNFPA would be for donor countries to increase the percentage of official development assistance (ODA) allocated for population assistance. UNFPA welcomes the fact that a number of OECD countries have established firm dates to reach the 0.7 per cent ODA target, for example, Ireland, by 2007, Belgium and Finland by 2010, France and Spain by 2012, and the United Kingdom by 2013. Furthermore, Canada intends to double its ODA between 2000 and 2010. UNFPA hopes that this increased ODA effort will be translated into higher contributions to the Fund and that the number of major donors will increase from 17 to at least 20 in the near future. In this context, UNFPA welcomes the recent agreement by the European Union External Relations Council (24 May 2005) to a new collective European Union target of 0.56 per cent ODA/GNI by 2010, that would result in additional annual 20 billion euros ODA by that time. Table 5: Projected percentage distribution of regular and co-financing arrangements, 2005 to 2007 Table 5 shows the projected percentage distribution of regular and co-financing arrangements. As of 1 April 2005, regular resources for 2005 are projected to make up 82 per cent of the total income, while co-financing arrangements will make up 18 per cent. Projections for 2006 and 2007 are also reflected in table 5. The gradual trend of certain donors to increase contributions to co-financing arrangements has stabilized. UNFPA will continue to stress the importance of increasing regular resources and maintaining a high percentage of regular resources as part of the Fund's total contributions income. Increasing resources and securing a diverse and solid donor base will remain high priorities for UNFPA. H. Percentage share of contributions by UNFPA major donors (those contributing $1 million and over) for 2004 and 2005, as of 1 April 2005 As of 31 December 2004, out of the 166 donors to UNFPA regular resources, 17 major donors provided about 97 per cent of the total regular resources contributions to UNFPA. The percentage breakdown in US dollar terms is: Netherlands (22.1 per cent), Japan (12.1 per cent), United Kingdom (11.3 per cent), Sweden (11.0 per cent), Norway (10.2 per cent), Denmark (9.1 per cent), Germany, (5.4 per cent), Finland (4.9 per cent), Switzerland (3.0 per cent), Canada (2.9 per cent), Belgium (1.2 per cent), Ireland (1.0 per cent), Italy (0.9 per cent), New Zealand (0.6 per cent), Australia (0.5 per cent), France (0.4 per cent), and Luxembourg (0.3 per cent). The remaining 149 donors accounted for approximately 3 per cent of the total regular resources. As of 1 April 2005, it is estimated that 17 major donors will account for approximately 98 per cent of the total contributions to UNFPA for 2005. It is a UNFPA goal to broaden the base of support to the Fund's regular resources, and discussions are ongoing with many major donor countries to increase their regular contributions. I. Income trends from 2000 to 2005 As indicated in table 6, in 2004, there was a 13.4 per cent increase in regular resources over the 2003 level due to the increases in contributions from nine of the Fund's major donors, i.e., Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In 2005, it is projected that there will be an 8.5 per cent increase in regular resources over the 2004 level due to the increases in contributions from Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Norway and Sweden. The Netherlands will remain the top donor of UNFPA with a contribution over $70 million. As seen in table 7, in 2004, the contribution for co-financing arrangements was $131.1 million and this included payments to the reproductive health commodity trust fund of $38.6 million. In 2005, it is projected that the contribution for co-financing arrangements will be $80 million. J. Official development assistance Table 8: Official development assistance of OECD/DAC countries (Primary funds for population assistance) Table 8 shows the primary funds from ODA allocated for population assistance by the major donor countries, namely: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. These OECD/DAC countries contributed approximately $289,651 million of ODA for the five-year period 1999-2003. Out of this total ODA, $14,734 million was allocated for population assistance, accounting for approximately 5.1 per cent of the total. ODA for population assistance would need to increase substantially if the international donor community is to achieve the ICPD resource target of providing $5.7 billion annually for population assistance. Conclusion UNFPA is reviewing its financial situation, and analysing its cash flow. In this connection, UNFPA appeals to all donor Governments, particularly the major donors, for the submission of their pledges and payment schedules. The inability in a number of cases to secure early and timely commitments, a firm payment schedule and early payments of pledges, remains an obstacle to the Fund's ability to contribute more fully to the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action and the achievement of the MDGs. UNFPA is especially appreciative of those donors who have made early payments. It is clear that only through the active support and shared responsibility with the Executive Board members will the Fund be able to ensure a more predictable cash flow and a stable income base. UNFPA values its close collaboration with the 166 donors contributing to the Fund and appreciates their generous commitment and unwavering support. It is in this spirit that UNFPA appeals to the members of the Executive Board and all members of the Fund's donor family to consider increasing their contributions for 2005 and future years to the highest level that their circumstances will permit. UNFPA is closely involved and a full partner in helping countries to achieve the MDGs, particularly, those aimed at improving maternal health (goal 5) and combating HIV/AIDS (goal 6). Since the time that the HIV/AIDS pandemic began, more than 60 million people have been infected. AIDS is the world's fourth largest killer, with 10 new HIV infections taking place every minute. UNFPA could scale up in HIV prevention and other key areas if more support were provided to the Fund. The issues addressed by the Fund, such as HIV/AIDS, have become far more serious than imagined. At the same time, health care costs have risen. Thus, it is imperative that the Fund's regular income continue to grow to a level of $400 million. Increased resources would enable UNFPA to expand its programmes to help countries attain the goals of the ICPD and the Millennium Declaration. In view of the inextricable links between population, reproductive health, poverty and the MDGs, the work of UNFPA is a key factor for attaining many of the MDGs. Because of the increasing demands for assistance among developing countries and countries with economies in transition for population and reproductive health, UNFPA presents data in annex 6 of this report on the highest levels of contributions to the Fund's regular resources by OECD/DAC members and the additional funds needed to reach the highest peak targets achieved by each donor throughout the years of reference. If all countries were able to contribute at their highest levels, the total regular income of the Fund would be $439 million. Annex 6 also presents the status of the 2005 pledges to UNFPA regular resources of its OECD/DAC donors. Out of the 29 OECD/DAC members, only 17 members, namely, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom have submitted their written pledges to UNFPA. UNFPA recalls the Monterrey Consensus adopted in March 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development, and expresses the hope that the announced increases of ODA of many OECD/DAC countries for the next few years will directly lead to increasing contributions to UNFPA. The Fund is pleased to report that almost all the new European Union members pledged a contribution during 2004. UNFPA is strengthening its partnerships with the new Member States of the European Union and hopes that they will increase their contributions to the Fund. Finally, it is essential that UNFPA continue to focus the bulk of its resource mobilization efforts on increasing regular resources. While obtaining increases in co-financing arrangements of the Fund is important, it must be emphasized that regular resources are the foundation and bedrock of the Fund's operations. UNFPA is steadfast in its belief that the Fund's resource mobilization philosophy and long-term strategy should be built on a strong and secure base of regular resources supplemented by various combinations of co-financing funding. This is critical to enable UNFPA to support countries in implementing the ICPD Programme of Action and achieving the MDGs and is essential for maintaining the multilateral nature of the Fund's work. K. Elements for a decision 31. The Executive Board may wish to: (a) Take note of the present report (DP/FPA/2005/8) and welcome the substantial increase in the 2004 regular income level, as well as the increase in 2004 co-financing income, resulting from increased contributions from a number of donors; and also welcome the contributions made by programme countries, enabling UNFPA to reach its highest ever number of donors; (b) Welcome the projected increase in the 2005 regular income level; (c) Recognize that sustaining and improving the UNFPA funding level will require countries that are in a position to do so to augment their funding efforts during the period of the UNFPA MYFF, 2004-2007; (d) Emphasize that UNFPA needs strong political and financial support, as well as increased and predictable core funding, in order to carry out its mandate and assist countries in implementing the ICPD Programme of Action and achieving the MDGs; (e) Encourage all countries, in a position to do so, to make contributions early in the year and to make multi-year pledges; (f) Reiterate that regular resources are the bedrock of UNFPA and essential to maintaining the multilateral, neutral and universal nature of its work; (g) Encourage UNFPA to continue to mobilize supplementary resources for its programmes, bearing in mind that core resources remain the bedrock of the resource mobilization strategy of UNFPA.
