Letter dated 22 April 2000 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council I have been instructed by my Government to lodge the strongest protest over the participation of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in a demonstration of 2,000 ethnic Albanians in Pristina, Kosovo and Metohija, the autonomous province of the Yugoslav constituent Republic of Serbia, requesting release of Fllora Brovina, an ethnic Albanian doctor, sentenced for anti-State activities. Speaking to the demonstrators, the Special Representative and Head of UNMIK requested that Doctor Brovina and all other ethnic Albanians sentenced for terrorist activities be released from prison. Bringing that improper act of the highest-ranking official of the United Nations administration in this Serbian province to your attention, I would like to advise that the demonstrators demanded release of all ethnic Albanians short of which, as their posters proclaimed, there will be "no peace and lasting stability" in Kosovo and Metohija. Ethnic Albanians have also set up a Civil Protest Council that has invited all residents of Kosovo and Metohija to join a protest on 26 April and demand release from prison of ethnic Albanians and have established "a team of legal experts" to prepare an annex to Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999 which would "exert pressure on the authorities in Belgrade" to release all ethnic Albanians sentenced for terrorist activities. The alignment of the Head of UNMIK with ethnic Albanian terrorist separatists, an act of unprecedented and undisguised partiality of a United Nations mission towards a terrorist separatist movement in the territory of a sovereign country, stands in stark contrast to the UNMIK mandate provided for by Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and prejudiced against Serbian and Yugoslav interests. Instead of carrying out the Mission's mandate and ensuring a secure environment for all residents of Kosovo and Metohija and the rule of law in that Serbian province, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Head of UNMIK is taking sides in local issues, espousing causes that are often a direct violation of the rule of law. This he does as he brings arbitrary and partial Regulations which are not founded in law and tolerates most drastic discrimination against Serbs and Montenegrins before illegal courts he has established outside the powers granted to him by his mandate. To request release of ethnic Albanian terrorist separatists not only amounts to a deliberate demonstration of wanton disregard for the sensitivities of the Serbian community in Kosovo and Metohija, many of whose members are arrested by the UNMIK police on trumped-up charges based only on false reports of ethnic Albanians and held in detention longer than six months and without the right to defence and the minimum protection either to potential defendants or their defence representatives and witnesses, but is also a slap in the face of justice and shows an utter lack of the sense of proportion. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Vladislav Jovanovic Chargé d'affaires a.i.
