UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL TD/B/COM.2/EM.1/4 2 June 1997 Original : ENGLISH TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD Commission on Investment, Technology and Related Financial Issues Expert Meeting on Existing Agreements on Investment and their Development Dimensions Geneva, 28-30 May 1997 Agenda item 3 EXAMINE AND REVIEW EXISTING AGREEMENTS ON INVESTMENT AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT DIMENSIONS IN PURSUANCE OF THE MANDATE OF PARAGRAPH 89(b) OF "A PARTNERSHIP FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT" Agreed conclusions */ The Expert Meeting reviewed bilateral investment treaties in pursuance of the mandate given in paragraph 89(b) of "A Partnership for Growth and Development" to identify and analyse implications for development of issues relevant to a possible multilateral framework on investment. It focused on five sets of issues, i.e. reasons for concluding bilateral investment treaties; issues addressed by bilateral investment treaties; experience with the application of bilateral investment treaties; the role of bilateral investment treaties in the development of national law and standards of international law; and the development dimensions. The Expert Meeting had a broad and useful discussion, though some questions deserve additional attention, such as the provisions in bilateral investment treaties which contribute to attracting foreign investment and at the same time address development concerns. It was considered that similar work to that undertaken by the current Expert Meeting but dealing with existing regional and multilateral agreements on investment is needed to obtain a more complete picture of existing agreements on investment, in pursuance of the mandate of paragraph 89(b) in "A Partnership for Growth and Development". */ Adopted by the Expert Meeting at its closing plenary meeting, on 30 May 1997.
