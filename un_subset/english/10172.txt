(Signed) Eldar KOULIEV Permanent Representative English Page Annex Statement issued by the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan on 14 June 1999 On 14 June 1999, from 4.30 a.m. to 9 a.m., about 300 troops of the Armenian armed forces made three attempts from their positions by the village of Ashagy Oratag, near the occupied Azerbaijani town of Agdara, to capture positions of the Azerbaijani armed forces by the village of Gyzyloba in the vicinity of the town of Terter. During the attacks, the hostile forces used heavy artillery, mortars and large-calibre machine-guns. Units of the Azerbaijani armed forces maintained prompt and vigorous resistance to the hostile forces and the Armenian troops were repulsed, with heavy losses, to their previous positions. During the four and half hour battle, two Azerbaijani soldiers were killed and four were injured in their entrenchment. The Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Azerbaijan states that the country's armed forces are ready to respond resolutely to any further attempts by the hostile forces. Full responsibility for the conflict lies with the Republic of Armenia.
