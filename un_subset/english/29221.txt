Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 1514 (2003) of 13 November 2003 Addendum 1. Further to my main report and its addendum (S/2004/3 and Add.1), I wish to inform the Security Council that the financial implications for the deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Côte d'Ivoire are currently projected at some $303 million for a six-month period, including $149 million in recurrent and $154 million in non-recurrent costs (for the acquisition of equipment and the deployment of military contingents). 2. The projections take into account personnel and assets of the United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire already on the ground and provide for the deployment of 6,240 military personnel, including 200 military observers, 120 staff officers, 350 civilian police officers and 435 international and 529 national staff, as well as 119 United Nations Volunteers. 3. An indicative breakdown of the projection for the deployment of the peacekeeping operation by main category of expenditure is provided, for information purposes, in the annex to the present addendum. 4. It would be my recommendation to the General Assembly that, should the Security Council decide to deploy the peacekeeping operation in Côte d'Ivoire, the related costs be considered an expense of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations and that the assessments to be levied on Member States would be credited to a special account to be established for that purpose.
