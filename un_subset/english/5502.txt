UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1998/495 10 June 1998 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: FRENCH LETTER DATED 9 JUNE 1998 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL I have the honour to bring to your attention the statement issued on 6 June 1998 by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union on the Ethiopia/Eritrea border dispute. I should be grateful if you would have the text of this letter and of its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) John WESTON Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations English Page Annex [Original: English] Statement by the Presidency of the European Union on the Ethiopia/Eritrea border dispute The European Union is extremely concerned at the serious escalation of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and in particular deplores the bombings of Asmara airport and Mekelle by each other's forces on 5 and 6 June. These unnecessary developments threaten the lives of innocent civilians and jeopardize plans for the evacuation of foreign nationals, including citizens of the European Union and other foreign nationals who wish to leave. We urge both parties to agree to a ceasefire and to resume cooperation with the facilitators, who are working to find a peaceful negotiated settlement. We remind both parties of the potential consequences this dispute has for future regional stability.
