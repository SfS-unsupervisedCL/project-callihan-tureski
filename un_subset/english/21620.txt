Fifty-eighth session Agenda item 121 Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 United Nations Institute for Training and Research* * The delayed submission of the present report is due to the extensive consultations required to finalize the document. Report of the Secretary-General Summary In section V of its resolution 57/292, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General, on the basis of consultations with the Executive Director of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on the financial viability of the Institute, including the status of all voluntary contributions and the payment of the accumulated debt of the Institute, as well as on provisions offered to other comparable organizations; and to address, in the context of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, based on aforementioned consultations with the Institute, specific proposals and options on how best to address the issue of its past and future maintenance and rental costs, drawing on the provisions made for other organizations associated with the United Nations. In order to compensate the Institute for its expenditures under the General Fund of UNITAR relating to the provision of the training in multilateral diplomacy and international affairs management to the diplomatic personnel of the missions to the United Nations free of charge, it is proposed to provide UNITAR with an annual subvention in the amount not exceeding its annual rental and maintenance costs ($165,630 in 2002). In this case, an additional provision of $331,300 would be required over and above the resources proposed under section 29, Management and central support services, of the biennial programme budgets. 1. It is recalled that, in response to the provisions of General Assembly resolution 56/208 of 21 December 2003, the Secretary-General submitted a report containing proposed modalities of addressing the issue of maintenance and rental costs of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) (A/57/479). 2. Having considered the above report, the General Assembly, in paragraphs 3 and 4 of section V of its resolution 57/292 of 20 December 2003 on UNITAR: (a) Requested the Secretary-General, based on consultations with the Executive Director of UNITAR, to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on the financial viability of the Institute, including the status of all voluntary contributions and the payment of the accumulated debt of the Institute, as well as on provisions offered to other comparable organizations; (b) Also requested the Secretary-General to address, in the context of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, based on aforementioned consultations with the Institute, specific proposals and options on how best to address the issue of its past and future maintenance and rental costs, drawing on the provisions made for other organizations associated with the United Nations. 3. The present report is submitted in response to the above requests of the General Assembly. II. Background 4. UNITAR has been charged rent by the United Nations for the premises it has occupied in Geneva since 1 January 1989 and in New York since 1 October 1996. The decision to charge the rent was based on General Assembly resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986, in which the Assembly approved the report of the Group of High-level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations (A/41/49). The report stated in its recommendation 36 that Member States and other users occupying office space on the United Nations premises should pay a rent based on current commercial rates. It was understood that it was the intent of the Group of Experts, in making this recommendation, that the United Nations regular budget should not have to bear any part of the rental expenses of bodies supported by extrabudgetary funds. 5. In its resolution 42/197 of 11 December 1987, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to restructure the Institute, inter alia, as follows: (a) the core training programme for 1988 and subsequent years financed from the General Fund should be reviewed by the Board of Trustees in the context of its programme and budget preparation and might be adjusted in the light of the financial resources available to the Institute; (b) the Institute should operate on the basis of voluntary contributions and such other additional resources that might be available; (c) general operational costs should be reduced to a minimum; and (d) staff costs, in relation to its overall budget, should be minimized. 6. In paragraph 3 of its resolution 47/227 of 8 April 1993, the General Assembly decided that, as at 1 January 1993, the funding of all the administrative budget and the training programmes of the Institute would be covered from voluntary contributions, donations, special purpose grants and executing agency overheads. 7. It is also recalled that in paragraph 2 of resolution 48/207 of 21 December 1993, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to examine, in accordance with paragraph 2 of General Assembly resolution 47/227, the measures taken in 1993 with a view to improving further the organization and coordination of the training programmes and research activities relating to training in New York, and to provide appropriate logistical and administrative support, within existing resources. In the statement of programme budget implications of the draft of resolution 48/207 (A/C.2/48/L.84), the Secretary-General indicated that the provision of office space in New York and Geneva, as well as the usual logistical and administrative support for the Institute, including senior fellows, would involve expenditures for rental and maintenance of office equipment, communications and miscellaneous services and, in accordance with the statute of UNITAR and, as decided by the General Assembly in its resolution 47/227, all such expenditures would have to be covered from voluntary contributions, donations, special purpose grants and executive agency overheads available to UNITAR, and not from the regular budget of the United Nations. 8. In paragraphs 11 and 12 of its resolution 56/208 of 21 December 2001, however, the General Assembly: (a) Requested the Secretary-General to clarify why UNITAR did not benefit from rental rates and maintenance costs similar to those enjoyed by other organizations affiliated with the United Nations, such as the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) and the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) and also requested the Secretary-General to submit proposals on how to waive or reduce the rental rates and maintenance costs charged to UNITAR with a view to alleviating its current financial difficulties, which are aggravated by the current practice of charging commercial rates; (b) Requested the Secretary-General to report to it at its fifty-seventh session on the implementation of the resolution, including details on the status of contributions to, and the financial situation of, UNITAR, as well as on the use of its services by Member States. 9. In the related report submitted in response to the requests contained in resolution 56/208 (A/57/479), the Secretary-General stated, inter alia, that: (a) He was not in a position to propose a complete waiver of the rental rates and maintenance costs charged to UNITAR without the express decision of the General Assembly in that regard, which should involve the United Nations regular budget assuming the rental and maintenance costs burden for UNITAR, while, at the same time, instituting an arrangement, whereby UNITAR would reimburse the United Nations for administrative support provided at the rate of 8 per cent of its general fund annual expenditures; (b) In that case, an estimated additional biennial appropriation of $293,000 would be required under section 27, Management and central support services, of the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003; (c) By so deciding, the General Assembly would override the provisions of paragraph 3 of its resolution 47/227; (d) A resolution from the General Assembly would be also required, which would amend paragraph 13, article VIII, of the Statute of UNITAR to include a provision to the effect that the Institute should be provided with reasonable space by the United Nations on a rent- and maintenance-free basis, to read as follows: "The general administrative, personnel and financial services of the United Nations shall be utilized by the Institute on conditions determined in consultation between the Secretary-General and the Executive Director, it being understood that the space occupied by the Institute is provided by the United Nations free of rent and maintenance charges"; (e) The amount of $310,974 owed by UNITAR at that time relating to unpaid rental and maintenance costs should be paid. 10. The General Assembly did not approve these proposed modalities and, as indicated in paragraph 2 above, requested in section V of its resolution 57/292 that this issue be revisited in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005. III. Financial situation of the Institute A. Financial history: 1965-2002 11. UNITAR was established in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1934 (XVIII) of 11 December 1963 as an autonomous entity within the framework of the United Nations for the purpose of providing training and research for Member States. In accordance with its Statute, UNITAR should be fully financed from extrabudgetary resources. Up to 1973, the General Assembly continued to take note of the annual report of UNITAR, while expressing its satisfaction with the increasing effectiveness of the Institute and the hope that it would have a greater and wider financial support (resolutions 2509 (XXIV), 2640 (XXV), 2767 (XXVI), 2950 (XXVII) and 3064 (XXVIII). In 1978, the Executive Director reported to the General Assembly that the reserves of the General Fund of UNITAR had been depleted and that the Board of Trustees of the Institute had requested to be presented with a balanced budget (A/33/14). The Institute's 1979 budget had to be reduced by more than 20 per cent. By resolution 38/177 of 19 December 1983, the General Assembly provided the Institute with an advance of $886,000 from the regular budget. As at 31 December 1991, the overall debt of UNITAR to the United Nations, reflecting shortfalls and deficits for the previous period, stood at $4,744,000, which, together with the sum advanced by the United Nations for the purchase of land, had reached approximately $10.1 million and continued to rise. 12. In accordance with paragraph 1 of General Assembly resolution 47/227, the building of UNITAR was transferred to the United Nations in return for the cancellation of the Institute's debt and coverage of its financial obligations for 1992 in the amount of $15,989,000, as indicated in the related statement of programme budget implications (A/C.5/47/82). Also, in accordance with the same resolution, in the biennium 1998-1999, the amount of $283,215, consisting of negative balances on special purpose grants projects and related to activities undertaken before 1992, was written off as part of the global debt of UNITAR against United Nations reserves (A/55/5/Add.4, para. 11). 13. Since 1993, UNITAR has undergone substantial changes. During the latter part of 1993, UNITAR headquarters was moved from New York to Geneva. The activities carried out of New York were terminated and phased out in 1994. A UNITAR liaison office was established in New York in 1996 after the Board of Trustees of the Institute had ensured that the opening of the office was financially viable. In paragraph 3 of its resolution 50/121, the General Assembly welcomed the decision of the Board of Trustees, and invited the Institute to open a liaison office in New York, insofar as it would be possible within its existing resources and pursuant to Assembly resolutions 47/227 and 49/125, in order to respond to the training needs of the missions and delegations of Member States in New York and in order to strengthen its cooperative relationship with the Secretariat. 14. Detailed information is provided in annexes I to III to the present report on the financial situation of UNITAR from 1993 to 2002, including summary information on all combined funds of UNITAR, the Special Purpose Grants Fund and the General Fund in particular. Annexes IV and V provide similar information from 1981 to 1991. 15. It will be noted that since the implementation of General Assembly resolution 47/227 in 1993 whereby the outstanding debts of UNITAR were written off, UNITAR has been able to carry out and expand its activities with no deficit, utilizing voluntary contributions and special purpose grants. B. General Fund and Special Purpose Grants Fund: growth trends 16. Divergent trends are observed as regards the operations of the Institute's General Fund and of the Special Purpose Grants Fund for the past 20 years. 17. The expenditures of the General Fund decreased from $2,435,200 in 1981 to $1,547,200 in 1990 and to $915,938 in 2002, while Governments' contributions to the General Fund also decreased, from $2,055,900 in 1981 to $373,900 in 1990 and to $252,711 in 2002. 18. On the other hand, the expenditures under the Special Purpose Grants Fund have increased, from $2,192,600 in 1981 to $2,543,500 in 1990 and to $5,846,109 in 2002. Consequently, programme support costs, which constitute a part of the General Fund's funding, have increased from $329,814 in 1993 to $472,686 in 2002. In the Institute's budget for 2003, expenditures under the Special Purpose Grants Fund are estimated at $7,992,600 and the related programme support costs at $686,098. 19. Accordingly, the average rate of programme support for 2001, 2002 and projected for 2003 is approximately 8.7 per cent, that is, 4.3 per cent lower than the standard programme support rate of 13 per cent. In this connection, if the reimbursement of programme and administrative support to the operations and expenditures of the Special Purpose Grants Fund were established at the standard rate of 13 per cent, without any exceptions, the resulting 2002 income from programme support would amount to $759,994, thus exceeding the actually received 2002 income of $472,686 by $287,308, and would allow to significantly improve the financial position of the General Fund. This measure, many times recommended by various audits of UNITAR, would help by charging the Special Purpose Grants Fund with a fair share of the administrative support and operating expenses of the Institute. 20. At the forty-first session of the Board of Trustees of UNITAR, held in Geneva from 29 April to 1 May 2003, a lengthy discussion took place regarding the budget presentation, for both the General Fund and the Special Purpose Grants Fund accounts. The relatively high level of reserves ($662,918 for the General Fund and $5,164,523 for the Special Purpose Grants Fund) were noted, giving rise to questions as to the need for additional voluntary contributions. 21. Concern regarding the declining trends in General Fund resources has been expressed on several occasions. In the report of the Joint Inspection Unit of 25 April 1980 (A/35/181), the inspectors noted that another characteristic of interest was that UNITAR funding was divided into income of the General Fund and contributions to the Special Purpose Grants Fund; the first was a component of the amount received for institutional support and as such was suffering a continuous decline in actual value, which was not being compensated by an adequate increase in the contributions of the countries; and the second was steadily increasing, but this was creating, as a result, a new kind of limitation on the authorities of the Institute in determining the orientation of its programming and could hamper its independence (para. 91). The inspectors also stated that another general problem had been the tendency of UNITAR to spread its work widely, expanding its scope and increasing the number of studies and training activities, rather than concentrating its resources on the analysis of a few major and basic problems of the United Nations system; there was a certain amount of pressure for extending its activities, since seeking acceptance, recognition and support is a necessary corollary for an Institute dependent upon voluntary contributions; nevertheless, such a tendency towards fragmentation could in the long run so dilute its programme and resources as to make its work ineffective (para. 31). 22. In a report, submitted on 30 September 1991 pursuant to the requests of the General Assembly in resolution 45/219 (A/46/482), the high-level independent consultant noted, in paragraph 20: "Paradoxically, whereas the General Fund is dwindling steadily for lack of contributions, the Special Purpose Grants Fund, despite understandable annual fluctuations, is considerably better off. Indeed, UNITAR continues to obtain considerable resources -- over $3 million in 1990 -- in the form of donations for specific purposes, which enable it to carry on an appreciable number of activities of interest to certain Member States. It should be noted that to some extent these activities place a burden on the General Fund inasmuch as they are run by staff whose posts are charged to the Fund ..." IV. Current administrative and financial arrangements for rental and maintenance costs of the Institute in New York and Geneva 23. In New York, the Institute's Liaison Office occupies office space in the DC-I building. For the period 1996-2001, the United Nations charged UNITAR with the rent and maintenance fee at the prevailing commercial rate, amounting to $32,940 annually. Starting from 1 January 2002 this was increased to 64,782 for total rented space per annum to comply with the increased commercial rates that the United Nations has to pay for rented space. However, UNITAR has not paid these bills since 1 January 1998, which results in an accumulated debt of $195,992 as at 31 December 2003. 24. In Geneva, UNITAR occupies 923.3 square metres in the Environment Centre building. The annual rent and maintenance fee in the amount of $58,630, which had been established at a privileged rental rate of approximately 20 per cent of the outside prevailing commercial rates, is to be paid by UNITAR to the Fondation des immeubles pour les organisations internationales, which manages this building. UNITAR is also required to pay for electricity up to $7,000 annually. Moreover, UNITAR must reimburse the United Nations Office at Geneva annually a total of $35,218 to provide for the following services: (a) cleaning ($14,266); and (b) messenger/security/shuttle services ($20,952). This brings the Institute's rent, maintenance costs and other administrative services costs in Geneva to a total of $100,848 per annum. However, UNITAR has not paid the United Nations Office at Geneva for messenger/security/shuttle services and office cleaning from 1999 to the present time, resulting in a debt of $125,192. Currently, UNITAR does not have any outstanding debt to the Fondation des immeubles pour les organisations internationales. 25. The Institute's annual requirements for rent and maintenance total $165,630 per annum, or $331,260 per biennium, as follows: Rent New York 64 782 Geneva (including electricity) 65 630 Total rent 130 412 Messenger/security/shuttle/cleaning services 35 218 Total per annum 165 630 26. The Institute's current unpaid bills owed to the United Nations as at 31 December 2002 amount to $321,185. 27. In addition, there are various contributions in-kind to UNITAR provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva in the form of administrative support, including payroll, accounting, travel and visa processing, personnel, the Integrated Management Information System, language training, etc, estimated by the United Nations Office at Geneva in the amount of $243,800 in 2002. Moreover, conference-servicing facilities in New York and Geneva are provided to UNITAR on an as available basis free of charge and UNITAR has to pay only for interpretation (if required) and rental of additional electronic equipment provided by the Office of Central Support Services. For instance, if UNITAR had to pay for the daily rental of conference rooms charged to extrabudgetary clients in Geneva, these charges would amount to $72,000 for 2002. V. Arrangements regarding rental rates and maintenance costs for the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research and the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development 28. As mentioned in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 56/208, UNIDIR and UNRISD enjoy benefits from reduced rental rates and maintenance costs. 29. In particular, UNIDIR occupies 332.3 square metres in the Palais des Nations. In accordance with General Assembly resolution 39/148 H, it receives a subvention from the regular budget of the United Nations towards meeting the costs of the Director and administration of the Institute. As indicated in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/45/7/Add.5), UNIDIR has continued to apply the rate of 5 per cent for administrative and programme support costs to reimburse the United Nations for the financial and personnel services provided by the United Nations Office at Geneva to the Institute. This reimbursement amounted in 2002 to $52,735. If UNIDIR was charged rent for its premises at the current rate of the Palais des Nations, $365 per square metre, its rent and maintenance payments would amount to $121,280 per annum. 30. UNRISD occupies 508.5 square metres in the Palais des Nations. Under the terms of reference of the Secretary-General's bulletin of 1 August 1963 (ST/SGB/126, para. 6), the Institute is accommodated free of charge, but if special premises have to be obtained for the Institute, it would pay the rent from its budget. In addition, in the light of its difficult financial situation, UNRISD pays for programme support at the reduced rate of 7 per cent of its total budget expenditures, designed to reimburse the United Nations for the services provided. The amount of UNRISD programme support was $209,989 in 2002. If the Institute were charged rent for its premises at the current rate of the Palais des Nations, $365 per square metre, its rent and maintenance payments amounting to $185,602 per annum, would be fully covered. The remaining balance of $24,387 would be used for offsetting part of the in-kind administrative support, estimated by the United Nations Office at Geneva in the amount of $147,800 in 2002. VI. Proposals to address rental rates and maintenance costs charged to the Institute A. Drawing on the provisions made for other comparable organizations 31. Taking into account the related provisions of General Assembly resolutions 41/213 and 47/227 mentioned in paragraphs 4 and 6 above, the Secretariat is not in a position to propose a waiver of the rental rates and maintenance costs charged to UNITAR without the express decision of the General Assembly in this regard, which should take into account the following modality. 32. Comparable organizations associated with the United Nations which have special provisions for maintenance and rental costs, referred to in operative paragraphs 3 and 4, section V, of General Assembly resolution 57/292, are two Geneva-based Institutes, namely UNIDIR and UNRISD. UNIDIR, by virtue of its Statute, receives a subvention from the regular budget of the United Nations for its administrative costs. With regard to UNRISD, it is not charged rent, but is charged overhead of 7 per cent of its annual expenditures, which the United Nations utilizes for the administrative support services provided to UNRISD. 33. Taking into account the provisions mentioned in part V above, of these two comparable organizations, the UNRISD model would involve the United Nations regular budget assuming the rental and maintenance costs burden for UNITAR, while at the same time instituting an arrangement whereby UNITAR would reimburse the United Nations for the administrative support provided. On the other hand, in order to duplicate the UNIDIR model, it would require the institution of a subvention from the regular budget and also an arrangement for UNITAR reimbursement to the United Nations of the administrative support costs. B. Training programme of the Institute for diplomats and its relation to the rental and maintenance costs 34. Concern has been expressed by the Board of Trustees of UNITAR for over a decade that the offices put at the Institute's disposal by the United Nations should be free of rent and maintenance costs (A/57/14, para. 21). The rationale for this is that UNITAR offers training programmes to diplomats accredited to United Nations Headquarters, regardless of their nationality, grade or functions, free of charge. In the opinion of the Board of Trustees, this constitutes a clear contribution to both the Member States and the Organization. In return, the Board of Trustees advocates that the Organization should waive the rent and maintenance charges to UNITAR and place the Institute on the same footing as other similar institutes within the United Nations. At the forty-first session of the Board of Trustees of UNITAR, it was suggested that since the training programme for diplomats rendered a concrete service to the Organization, there could be ways to seek its funding through the United Nations regular budget. 35. The training programme for international cooperation and diplomacy and its operating costs are financed from the Institute's General Fund. The resources under the UNITAR General Fund have been continuously declining. The major source of income for the UNITAR General Fund are programme support costs generated by expenditures of the Special Purpose Grants Fund. The total costs for the training programme for the biennium 2002-2003 are estimated at $709,653, including provisions for three posts ($482,253) and non-post costs ($227,400). VII. Conclusions 36. In order to compensate the Institute for the General Fund expenditures relating to the provision, free of charge, of the training of diplomatic personnel of the missions to the United Nations in multilateral diplomacy and international affairs management, it is proposed that UNITAR be provided with an annual subvention in the amount not exceeding its annual rental and maintenance, cleaning, messenger, security and shuttle service costs ($165,630 in 2002). 37. The request for the subvention should be subject to review by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in the context of its usual consideration of the UNITAR budget for the next financial period. For the presentation, implementation and financial monitoring purposes, the training programme for international cooperation and diplomacy should be a separate part of the General Fund budget, while rental, maintenance and other services (messenger/security/shuttle and travel agency rental) should be provided as separate lines in the administrative budget of the Institute. 38. The proposed budget for the next financial period together with the comments and recommendations thereon of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions should be submitted for consideration and approval by the Board of Trustees in accordance with article III, paragraph 2 (c), of the Statute of UNITAR, and after adoption of the budget, a recommendation of the Board for a subvention from the regular budget of the United Nations should be transmitted by the Secretary-General to the General Assembly for approval. 39. In view of the above arrangements, it is proposed that the accumulated debt of UNITAR to the United Nations in the amount of $321,184 be repaid within a period of five years from the Institute's available resources. Furthermore, in order to ensure stability of the funding for the General Fund and the viability of repaying the Untied Nations its debt, UNITAR will be requested to increase the programme support rate of the Special Purpose Grants Fund as recommended by the Board of Trustees of UNITAR at its fortieth and forty-first sessions. VIII. Recommendations 40. In order to address the issue of the Institute's past and future rental and maintenance costs, the following arrangements are proposed for consideration by the General Assembly: (a) In the light of the training programme for diplomats provided by UNITAR free of charge, an annual subvention of $165,630 in respect of its rental, maintenance and other costs (cleaning, messenger, security and shuttle services) may be provided from the United Nations regular budget. Accordingly, an additional provision of $331,300 would be required under section 29, Management and central support services, of the proposed programme budget for 2004-2005; (b) The Executive Director should be requested to arrange to repay the amount of $321,184 owed to the United Nations within a period of five years. To this end, UNITAR should rationalize its financial structure, particularly the application of a consistent programme support rate to the Special Purpose Grants Fund to bring it in line with the recommendation of the Board of Trustees. 41. In this connection, the General Assembly should also request the Secretary-General to amend, after consultations with the Board of Trustees of UNITAR, paragraph 13 of article VIII, of the Statute of UNITAR and to add a new paragraph 14 to article VIII, to read as follows: "13. The general administrative, personnel and financial services of the United Nations shall be utilized by the Institute on conditions determined in consultation between the Secretary-General and the Executive Director, it being understood that no extra cost to the regular budget of the United Nations is to be incurred, without the express approval of the General Assembly. "14. An annual subvention towards meeting the operational non-post costs of the training in multilateral diplomacy and international affairs management to the diplomatic personnel of the missions to the United Nations may be provided from the regular budget of the United Nations. The actual amount of the subvention may be less, but shall not exceed, an amount equivalent to the annual costs of rent and maintenance of the offices put at the disposal of the Institute by the United Nations."
