Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) Note verbale dated 21 October 2011 from the Permanent Mission of Qatar to the United Nations addressed to the Chair The Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) and, in accordance with the provisions of resolution 1810 (2008), has the honour to attach herewith information on the implementation by the State of Qatar of resolution 1540 (2004) as provided by the competent authorities of the State of Qatar (see annex). Report of Qatar on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) Immediately after the issuance of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) on 28 April 2004, the State of Qatar was quick to respond to the requirements of that resolution and established the National Committee for the Prohibition of Weapons (NCPW). The Committee was established on 4 October of the same year, at the Ministry of Defence, pursuant to Cabinet resolution No. 26 of 2004. NCPW is highly concerned with proposing necessary legislation for the implementation of international treaties relevant to the prohibition of all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, as well as proposing and revising the necessary legislation and procedures related to the prohibition of these weapons and work to implement them. In this regard, the State of Qatar issued the following: (a) Law 28 of 2002 on anti-money-laundering, which punishes, pursuant to article 2, all forms of the acquisition or possession of money earned from crimes such as illicit trafficking in weapons, ammunition, explosives or terrorist crimes, when the intention was to conceal the real source of the money and to show that its source is legitimate; (b) Law 40 of 2002 on customs, as well as imposing control over state exports and imports; (c) Law 3 of 2004 on combating terrorism; (d) Law 17 of 2007 on chemical weapons, to implement the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, after Qatar had acceded to it in 1997 and ratified it in 2003; (e) A draft Law on Biological Weapons, recently completed by NCPW, along with a draft "National system of accounting for and control of nuclear materials" to implement the safeguards agreement which had been signed with the International Atomic Energy Agency. This is in addition to the keenness of the State of Qatar to host several workshops promoting the actual implementation of resolution 1540 (2004), including: (a) A regional workshop for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism, entitled "International organizations and their role in the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism", which was held on 29 and 30 April 2008 under the auspices of H.E. the State Minister for Internal Affairs; (b) A workshop on "Nuclear radiation", which was held in November 2008 in collaboration with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As the State of Qatar is seeking to impose control to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological and their means of delivery) and to implement resolution 1540 (2004), NCPW, within the framework of the Convention, has organized several courses for customs officials in Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The courses include the following: (a) A basic course for Asian authorities implementing the Convention, held from 19 to 23 October 2008; (b) A regional workshop on the implementation of resolution 1540 (2004), held from 8 to 11 March 2009; (c) A national awareness-raising workshop for staff in the industry sector on weapons of mass destruction, held from 11 to 13 October 2009; (d) The eleventh workshop on "The coordination of assistance and protection", pursuant to article 10 of the Convention, held from 1 to 3 November 2009; (e) A regional training course for customs authorities in Gulf Cooperation Council countries on the "Technical aspects of transport systems", held on 4 and 5 November 2009; (f) A training course on "Transport systems for customs staff in Gulf Cooperation Council countries", pursuant to the Convention, held on 5 and 6 December 2010. It is worth mentioning in this regard that NCPW devotes considerable attention to raising community awareness concerning weapons of mass destruction and their dangers. Accordingly, NCPW has formed a specialized working group. Within the framework of community awareness, NCPW organized, on 24 March 2011, a workshop for students in secondary schools. The Committee decided to meet on a regular basis. Currently, NCPW is preparing to set up similar workshops for undergraduates.
