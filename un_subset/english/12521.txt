New York, 24 April-19 May 2000 Communiqu√© from the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Rio Group concerning the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Submitted by Colombia on behalf of the Rio Group 1. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the countries members of the Permanent Mechanism for Consultation and Policy Coordination, Rio Group, realizing that the existence of nuclear weapons poses a grave threat to the survival of humanity, reiterate the full commitment of their countries to abide by and observe the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, urge all States that are party thereto to fulfil their obligations and emphasize the importance of the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is designed to strengthen the Treaty and its review process; 2. Consider that the Treaty is the focal point where all actions to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons converge and that it is the proper instrument for preventing the spread of the threat that the very existence of such weapons presents; 3. Are convinced that, in order for the non-proliferation regime to be truly effective and universal, it is essential that all States that have not yet signed and ratified the Treaty should do so and that those which have demonstrated that they have a nuclear capacity should do so as a matter or urgency; 4. Reaffirm that one of the most successful ways to advance towards the achievement of the total elimination of nuclear weapons is by creating nuclear-weapons-free zones, and reiterate the validity of the Treaty of Tlatelolco so that Latin America may continue to be a region free from nuclear weapons and, in that context, express their support for the creation of such zones in all the regions of our planet. In that connection, they recall the appeal made in 2000, at the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, by the countries of the Andean Community; 5. Likewise recall the Declaration of the Forum for Consultation and Policy Coordination of MERCOSUR, Bolivia and Chile on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty; 6. Support the initiative submitted at the sixth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by Mexico, on behalf of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden, and the working paper on nuclear disarmament. In particular, they associate themselves to the appeal to nuclear-weapon States to assume an unequivocal commitment by completely eliminating their nuclear arsenals and to embark, in the course of the next review period 2000-2005, on an accelerated negotiations process and to take steps aimed at nuclear disarmament to which all States Parties will be bound under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons; 7. Reiterate their support for the negotiation in the Conference on Disarmament of a non-discriminatory, multilateral, internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices, bearing in mind not only the goal of non-proliferation but also that of nuclear disarmament.
