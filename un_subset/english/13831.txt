Fifty-fifth session Agenda item 152 Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic Financial performance report of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financial performance of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic (MINURCA) for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 (A/55/849). During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information. 2. As indicated in paragraph 13 and table 1 of the report of the Secretary-General, an amount of $41,098,075 gross ($40,069,275 net) was appropriated for the maintenance and liquidation of MINURCA for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000. The related expenditure for the same period amounted to $39,900,975 gross ($38,916,875 net), resulting in an unencumbered balance of $1,197,100 gross ($1,152,400 net). 3. The unencumbered balance was attributable primarily to the lower costs for military personnel ($183,000), civilian personnel ($363,900), operational requirements ($469,700), other programmes ($135,700) and staff assessment ($44,700). 4. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of annex II to the report of the Secretary-General that the unutilized balance of $363,900 under civilian personnel was primarily attributable to reduced requirements under civilian police ($7,300), international and local staff ($266,400) and civilian electoral observers ($90,100). 5. With regard to international and local staff, the Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 5 of annex II to the report of the Secretary-General that a saving of $266,400 under this item was mainly due to the fact that actual salary costs were lower than standard salaries used in the budget. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the Mission had a higher number of mission appointees during the period than had been budgeted, which in turn had contributed to lower common staff costs. 6. In connection with operational requirements, the Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of annex II to the report of the Secretary-General that the unutilized balance of $469,700 resulted from reduced requirements under premises/accommodation ($167,300), infrastructure repairs ($13,300), transport operations ($55,700), air operations ($168,300), communications ($39,800), other equipment ($4,600) and air surface freight ($64,000), partially offset by additional requirements under supplies and services ($43,300). 7. The Advisory Committee was informed that, at 28 February 2001, the amount of $29,607,643 had been reimbursed for troop costs for the period from 27 March 1998 to 11 March 2000. With regard to reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment, the Committee was informed that the amount was $773,600; the estimated amount owed at 28 February 2001 was $9,667,100 (of which $1,873,200 was held in accounts payable) and unliquidated obligations for contingent-owned equipment amounted to $8,778,300. For death and disability compensation, at 28 February 2001, two claims had been settled, amounting to $100,000; the balance of obligations amounts to $316,700 and two claims were remaining. 8. The Advisory Committee was informed that, at 19 March 2001, the cash position amounted to $1.0 million. Assessment on Member States amounted to $116.3 million, payments received totalled $78.2 million and at 28 February 2001, the amount outstanding was $38.1 million. Total unliquidated obligations for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, at 16 March 2001, were $5,071,200 ($3,897,000 for Governments and $1,174,200 for others) and current loans were $17.1 million ($13.9 million from the peacekeeping Reserve Fund and $3.2 million from the United Nations Mission in Haiti). 9. Upon enquiry as to the status of the liquidation process, the Advisory Committee was informed that the intention was to complete the process by June 2001. The Committee will consider the relevant report in 2002. The Committee was also informed that the Mission had operated without the field assets control system. 10. The Advisory Committee is concerned that the reasons for variations in performance have not been adequately explained. The Advisory Committee recommends that variation in performance should be fully analysed in future reports. 11. The action to be taken by the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session in connection with the financing of MINURCA for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 is indicated in paragraph 14 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/55/849). The Advisory Committee recommends that the unencumbered balance of $1,197,100 gross ($1,152,400 net) for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 be credited to Member States in a manner to be decided by the General Assembly.
