The present section includes an analysis of gratis personnel engaged by the United Nations Secretariat during the biennium 2010-2011. Gratis personnel are personnel seconded to the United Nations by Governments or other entities at no cost to the Organization. Type I gratis personnel consist of interns, associate and technical cooperation experts on non-reimbursable loans. Type II gratis personnel are provided to the Organization by Governments or other entities responsible for the remuneration of their services. Such personnel do not serve under any other established regime. They may be accepted for two purposes and on an exceptional basis only: (a) to provide expertise not available within the Organization for very specialized functions; or (b) to provide temporary and urgent assistance in the case of new and/or expanded mandates of the Organization. During the reporting period, almost all type II gratis personnel were engaged by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs under the Standby Partnership Programme, a mechanism that allows the deployment of surge personnel in emergency situations and for short periods of time. 4. The information for type I and type II gratis personnel, as shown in table 2, includes all engagements during the reporting period. The total number of individual gratis personnel employed during the 2010-2011 biennium was 4,865 (4,364 interns, 358 associate experts, 54 technical cooperation experts and 90 type II personnel). This number is less than the cumulative number of engagements of gratis personnel (4,942), as one individual may have had several engagements of different types in one or more departments and offices. 5. Nationals from a total of 145 countries served as gratis personnel during the 2010-2011 biennium. For a more detailed breakdown of gratis personnel by nationality, see annex I, table 1.A (for type I) and annex I, table 2.A (for type II). Table 2 Engagement of gratis personnel: 2010-2011 Total Percentage of all Intern Associate experts Technical cooperation experts Type II Note: The total number of individuals engaged was 4,865. Some individuals had several engagements of different types with one or more departments and offices. 6. Table 3 shows the trend for gratis personnel during the last three bienniums. It indicates that the number of engagements of gratis personnel has been consistent over the last six years, with the exception of the number of interns, which increased in the biennium 2008-2009, and has held steady since then. Engagement of gratis personnel during the last three bienniums Type I gratis personnel Number of engagements Interns Number of Member States Number of Departments Type II gratis personnel Average duration of service (months) 7. A total of 40 receiving entities engaged type I gratis personnel during the 2010-2011 biennium, but almost all type II personnel were engaged by OCHA. Table 4 shows the largest users of gratis personnel by entity. For a more detailed breakdown of type I gratis personnel by entity see annex I, table 1.B.

During the 2010-2011 biennium, 65 per cent of all gratis personnel engaged (both type I and type II) were female. Female personnel made up 66 per cent of type I engagements, while 53 per cent of those engaged under type II arrangements were female. Figure I illustrates the gender breakdown by each group of gratis personnel. For a more detailed breakdown of the gender of gratis personnel, see annex I, tables 1.A, 1.B and 2.A. Figure I Engagement of gratis personnel, by gender: 2010-2011 (Population: 4,942 engagements) D. Length of service 9. Figure II illustrates the average length of service by number of days of employed during the biennium 2010-2011 for each group of gratis personnel. The average length of service for both types of gratis personnel was 173 days. Figure II Engagement of gratis personnel by average length of service, in days: 2010-2011 10. There were three different populations of staff members employed by the United Nations Secretariat during the biennium 2010-2011: retired staff, non-retired former staff and staff retained beyond the mandatory age of retirement. Additional details on retired staff can be found in annex II, tables 1.A, 1.B, 1.C, 1.D and 2.A to the present report. Further information on staff members retained beyond the mandatory age of retirement is provided in annex II, tables 6 and 7. 11. A retired staff member, as defined in the report of the Secretary-General of 20 October 1998 (A/53/526), refers to "a staff member 55 years of age or older who, consequent upon service exceeding five years, is in receipt of a pension benefit from the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund". As shown in table 5, based on that description, there were 2,361 engagements of retired staff during the biennium 2010-2011, including a total of 825 persons who met the definition of retired staff who were working in the Secretariat during that period. 12. The population of non-retired former staff refers to former staff members, 60 years of age or older, who opted for a withdrawal settlement and were reemployed for six months or more during the reporting period. In accordance with article 31 of the regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, a withdrawal settlement is payable to participants in the Pension Fund whose age on separation is less than the normal retirement age, or in the event that the participants are of the normal retirement age or older on separation but are not entitled to a retirement benefit. During the biennium 2010-2011 there were 225 staff members meeting that description working on a total of 605 engagements in different entities. 13. The third population includes staff retained in service beyond the mandatory age of retirement. Administrative instruction ST/AI/2003/8 sets out the criteria governing the retention of staff beyond the mandatory age of separation, including when: (a) it has not been possible to identify a qualified candidate to discharge the functions of the post in a timely manner; and (b) retention of the staff member is in the interest of the Organization owing to the exigencies of the service concerned. Accordingly, 108 staff members retained beyond the mandatory age of retirement worked during the biennium 2010-2011. Those persons were employed by several entities on a total of 221 engagements. 14. Staff members in the three populations reported on herein came from 103 Member States. Retired staff employed during the reporting period were from 83 Member States, while non-retired former staff members came from 65 Member States. Staff retained beyond the mandatory retirement age were from 53 Member States. Table 5 Number of engagements and persons engaged: retired staff, non-retired former staff and staff retained beyond retirement age: 2010-2011 (Population: 3,187 engagements) Number of persons engaged Number of days worked Non-retired former staff Staff members retained beyond retirement age Note: The number of engagements is different from the number of persons in each category because an individual may have several engagements during a reporting period. 15. Table 6 shows the trend regarding the employment of retired staff during the last three bienniums. The trend indicates that the absolute number of retired staff, the total number of engagements, and the corresponding number of days worked all decreased during the last biennium. Table 6 Number of engagements and number of retired staff engaged during the last three bienniums Number of persons Number of days worked Number of entities that used retired staff Member States represented 16. During the biennium 2010-2011, retired staff worked for 39 entities, nonretired former staff members were employed by 26 entities and 11 entities employed staff members who were retained beyond the mandatory age of separation. Additional information on retired staff is available in annex II, table 1, and additional information for staff retained beyond the mandatory age of separation is available in annex II, table 3.A.

Table 11 provides details on two retired staff members (one female, one male), each having served in two different functions, who accrued over two years of service during a period that included the biennium 2010-2011. The total number of days worked by the two individuals was 1,327.

For the purpose of the present report, decision-making positions are defined as being at the D-1 level and above. During the biennium 2010-2011, there were 33 retired staff employed in decision-making positions. Further information on this subgroup of retired staff is available in annex II, table 2.A.

The present section contains analysis of the use of consultants and individual contractors during the biennium 2010-2011. The data contained in annex III, tables 1.A, 1.B, 2.A, 2.B, 2.C, 3.A and 3.B provides further information on the engagement of consultants and individual contractors in non-field operations on contract during the reporting period. Annex III, tables 4.A and 4.B, include additional details on the number of engagements of locally recruited consultants and individual contractors at field operations, and annex III, table 5, provides detailed information on institutional contractors. 23. The total number of engagements of consultants and individual contractors is 45,628. There were 17,618 different engagements of consultants and individual contractors recruited by non-field operations entities, 10,664 for consultants and 6,954 for individual contractors (see table 18). With regard to field operations, 28,010 engagements were recorded during the biennium 2010-2011, 513 for consultants and 27,497 for individual contractors. In terms of the number of persons, a total of 9,986 individuals were engaged as consultants or individual contractors at non-field operations during the reporting period, and a net total of 24,405 individuals were locally recruited as consultants or individual contractors at field operations (see table 19). 24. Consultants and individual contractors employed at non-field operations during the biennium 2010-2011 were of 180 nationalities; consultants came from 176 Member States and individual contractors came from 136 Member States. Consultants employed at field operations came from 71 Member States and individual contractors from 56 Member States. Taken together, consultants and individual contractors were of 83 nationalities.

Table 20 shows the trend for the employment of consultants and individual contractors at non-field operations during the last three bienniums. The trend shows a decrease in both the number of personnel engaged and the total number of engagements in the biennium 2010-2011 as against the previous biennium. In addition, there is a significant decrease in the number of days worked. This is the result of a change in the methodology used for contracts (in particular, lump-sum contracts). In the present report, the number of days worked is derived by taking expenditure divided by an average daily rate for each contract. In previous reports, it was calculated by taking the difference between contract end and start dates. Table 20 Engagement of consultants and individual contractors at non-field operations during the last three bienniums Number of contracts Number of Member States represented 26. Details on the number of engagements of consultants and individual contractors at non-field operations for the 12 entities with the highest number of persons are shown in table 21. More details are provided in annex III, table 2.A. The 12 field operations with the highest number of engagements are shown in table 22, and additional information is provided in annex III, table 4.A. Table 23 provides information on occupational groups for which there were more than 200 engagements at non-field operations during the reporting period. Additional information is provided in annex III, table 1.B. Table 24 provides further information on the purpose of engagements at non-field operations.

Of the total number of individual contractors and consultants employed at nonfield operations during 2010-2011, 39 per cent were female and 61 per cent were male. In the case of consultants and individual contractors employed at field operations, 17 per cent were female and 83 per cent were male.

Figures IV and V include the percentages of former staff engaged as consultants and individual contractors at non-field operations during the biennium 2010-2011. Figure V Former staff engaged as individual contractors at non-field operations: 29. The average length of engagement for consultants and individual contractors employed at non-field operations was 56 days during the biennium 2010-2011. Figure VI provides a breakdown of engagements of consultants and individual contractors at non-field operations by length of engagement. Figure VI Engagement of consultants and individual contractors at non-field operations, by length of engagement: 2010-2011 30. Annex III, table 2.C, provides a list of entities that employed consultants for a period longer than a year during the biennium 2010-2011 (307 persons). That number is lower than the number of engagements of consultants for a period longer than a year (350), shown in figure VI, since some individuals were engaged more than once during the reporting period. Twenty-five entities employed consultants for a period of longer than one year. There was a decrease in that number during the biennium 2010-2011 owing to a change in methodology, as mentioned above (see para. 25). In addition, in the previous report (A/65/350 and Add.1), records in IMIS of US$ 1 contracts for UNDAC personnel were included, many of which had length of more than one year. This was purely for administrative purposes, however, and in actual fact, such personnel were only deployed for short periods of time and exclusively in emergency situations. That being the case, those IMIS records have not been added to the numbers currently being reported. 31. During the reporting period, 64 persons from the group of UNDAC consultants with OCHA were deployed as part of UNDAC teams (12 female and 52 male), for a total of 74 deployments with an average duration of 14 days per deployment. Details on UNDAC deployments by nationality of person deployed and emergency situation are provided in annex III, tables 3.A and 3.B. V. Conclusion 32. The Secretary-General invites the General Assembly to take note of the present report.
