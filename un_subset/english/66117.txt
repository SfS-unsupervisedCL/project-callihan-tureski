The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the budget performance of the United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic (UNSMIS) for the period from 14 April to 30 June 2012 (A/67/707). During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification, concluding with written responses received on 28 February 2013. 2. The Security Council, in its resolution 2043 (2012), decided to establish UNSMIS for an initial period of 90 days, comprising an initial deployment of up to 300 unarmed military observers as well as an appropriate civilian component, to monitor the cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties and to monitor and support the full implementation of the six-point proposal of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States. In its resolution 2059 (2012), the Council decided to renew the mandate of UNSMIS for a final period of 30 days (until 19 August 2012). 3. The Advisory Committee recalls that following the decisions of the Security Council and pursuant to General Assembly resolution 64/269, the Committee's concurrence was sought and granted for the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the urgent establishment of the Mission, its expeditious deployment and requirements related to the renewal of the mandate of the Mission until 19 August 2012, as follows: (a) In its letter of 30 April 2012 to the Secretary-General, the Committee concurred with the request for authorization to enter into commitments in an amount not to exceed $16,796,300 gross ($16,555,500 net), comprising the amount of $14,142,400 gross ($13,976,800 net) for the period from 14 April to 30 June 2012 and $2,653,900 gross ($2,578,700 net) for the period from 1 to 20 July 2012, to meet the initial and most immediate start-up requirements of the Mission; (b) In its letter of 14 June 2012, the Committee concurred with the request for authorization to enter into commitments for an additional amount not to exceed $10,992,700 required for critical equipment and supplies available from the strategic deployment stocks during the initial deployment of UNSMIS until 20 July 2012. The Committee recalls from its letter that this request represented the first application of the mechanism established by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/269, under which drawings from the strategic deployment stocks were no longer required to be funded immediately from a commitment authority and the funding for the replacement of equipment withdrawn from the stocks was to be provided only when the initial appropriation was received. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the drawings from the strategic deployment stocks for the Mission were completed during the financial period 2011/12; (c) In its letter of 27 July 2012, the Committee concurred with the request for authorization to enter into commitments in an amount not to exceed $3,283,000 gross ($3,252,900 net) to meet the additional requirements of the Mission related to the renewal of its mandate for the period from 20 July to 19 August 2012. 4. The total commitments granted to the Secretary-General, as detailed in paragraph 3 above, amounted to $31,072,000, which consisted of the following: (a) For the period 2011/12, a total of $25,135,100 ($14,142,400, plus $10,992,700 for equipment and supplies from the strategic deployment stocks); (b) For the period 2012/13, a total of $5,936,900 ($2,653,900 plus $3,283,000). 5. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee was informed in September 2012 that the liquidation of the Mission was expected to continue for up to three months, from 20 August to 19 November 2012. In its letter of 16 October 2012, the Committee concurred with requests to extend the validity of the commitment authority for UNSMIS for an additional three-month period to 19 November 2012 and to revise the commitment authority as follows: (a) for the period 2011/12, to $22,844,910 (a reduction of $2,290,190); and (b) for the period 2012/13, to $8,227,090 (an increase of $2,290,190). II. Budget performance for the period from 14 April to 30 June 2012 6. Information with respect to the mandate performance of the Mission is provided in paragraphs 6 to 15 of the performance report. For the period from 14 April to 30 June 2012, expenditures totalled $17,588,800 for military and police personnel ($3,280,000), civilian personnel ($721,500) and operational costs ($13,587,300). An analysis of expenditures is provided in section IV of the report. 7. The Advisory Committee enquired as to how many staff of UNSMIS had been transferred to the Office of the Joint United Nations-League of Arab States Special Envoy to Syria. The Committee was informed that a total of 35 civilian staff (7 substantive, 6 support and 22 security) who had been on temporary duty assignment with the Mission were assigned to the Office. 8. The Advisory Committee noted from the supplementary information provided to it that expenditure in the amount of $1.07 million was incurred under mine detection and mine clearing services, which was not clearly stated in the performance report. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that activities related to the expenditure had been coordinated by the Mine Action Service of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which provided 12 training sessions for 178 military observers, 73 national staff of the United Nations country team and 41 civilian staff members. Upon request, the Committee was also informed of the following breakdown of related expenditures: personnel costs (20 per cent); travel (15 per cent); equipment (35 per cent); and other operational costs to support the deployment of the team (30 per cent). 9. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the equipment and supplies obtained from the strategic deployment stocks, both non-expendable and expendable, totalled 13,081 items, with a value of $8,613,900 as at 30 June 2012. In addition, expenditure in the amount of $705,000 was incurred for equipment procured externally. The equipment included accommodation equipment such as curtains, blinds, refrigerators and air conditioners; office furniture including desks and chairs; security and safety equipment such as card readers, security mirrors and alarms; communications equipment including telephone systems, satellite phones, cell phones and secure faxes; information technology equipment including notebook computers; medical equipment including trauma bags; and special equipment including binoculars and night-vision devices. 10. The Advisory Committee recalls that in its letter of 16 October 2012, it reiterated its expectation that full details on the utilization of the resources granted under the commitment authority would be provided for its consideration in the context of the performance reports for the financial periods 2011/12 and 2012/13.
