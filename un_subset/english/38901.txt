Letter dated 15 December 2006 from the President of the Security Council to the Secretary-General I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 4 December 2006 (S/2006/987), transmitting the letter dated 14 November 2006 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq containing the request that $40 million of the balance in the account of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) be transferred to the account of the Permanent Mission of Iraq to the United Nations, has been brought to the attention of the members of the Security Council. They take note of the information contained in your letter. The members of the Council propose that the $40 million be transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq in the light of the expressed intention of the Government of Iraq to purchase facilities near United Nations Headquarters and to renovate the current headquarters of the Mission and the residence of the Permanent Representative, taking into consideration that the residual balance in the UNMOVIC account should be sufficient to finance the Commission's activities at its present level. (Signed) Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser President of the Security Council
