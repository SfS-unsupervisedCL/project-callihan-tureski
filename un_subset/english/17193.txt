Fifty-seventh session Agenda item 112 Programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 Estimates in respect of matters of which the Security Council is seized Eighteenth report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions I. Introduction 1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on estimates in respect of matters of which the Security Council is seized (A/C.5/57/23). During its consideration of the matter, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information. 2. The report of the Secretary-General presents estimated resource requirements for six peace-building or assistance missions, seven political offices or special representatives or envoys of the Secretary-General and six monitoring mechanisms or committees. Included for the first time are the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the Panel of Experts on Somalia. As indicated in paragraph 2 and table 1 of the report, 6 of the 19 entities have mandates to operate until 31 December 2003, and the mandates of 12 of the others are expected to be extended. The estimates also include one political mission, namely, the Monitoring Mechanism on Sanctions against UNITA, whose mandate is not expected to be extended. Although they represent charges against the provision of $98,338,700 for special political missions under section 3, Political affairs, of the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003, the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for West Africa, the United Nations Office in Somalia, the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Myanmar and the Central American peace process are not included in the report -- the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for West Africa and the United Nations Office in Somalia because two-year budgets for them had been approved by the Assembly in its resolution 56/274 A for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2003, and MINUGUA, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Myanmar and the Central American peace process because extension of their mandates falls within the purview of the General Assembly. 3. In order to provide a greater degree of predictability regarding the overall level of resource requirements for political missions for the balance of the biennium, the Secretary-General proposes, in paragraphs 3 to 5 of his report, the provision of appropriations in anticipation of the renewal of individual mandates along the lines of arrangements currently in place for peacekeeping operations. The Advisory Committee agrees with this proposal, on the understanding that the related expenditure in this regard be subject to a valid mandate as decided upon by the competent legislative organ of the United Nations. 4. As shown in table 2 of the report, the total estimated requirements for the extension of the missions amounts to $82,764,400 net ($90,947,500 gross). Taking into account the estimated unencumbered balance of $13,736,300 anticipated to remain at the end of the current mandate periods, the additional amount requested in the report, under the procedures provided for in paragraph 11 of annex I to resolution 41/213, total $69,028,100 net ($77,211,200 gross). The Advisory Committee notes, as indicated in paragraph 3 of the report, that all of the initial 2002-2003 appropriation of $98.3 million had been fully committed within the first six months of 2002. These funds were supplemented by additional appropriations of $14.7 in June 2002 for the United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peace-building and for UNAMA. In addition, the first performance report for the biennium 2002-2003 reports the use of a further $11.3 million, under the provisions of resolution 56/256 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenditures, to provide for special political missions in Angola, Liberia and Somalia. The Committee was informed that the total estimated requirements for special political missions for the biennium 2002-2003, including missions mandated by the General Assembly, amounted to approximately $201 million. Upon request the Committee was provided with a breakdown (see annex I). II. General considerations 5. Future reports should be comprehensive. They should include all missions already charged or to be charged to the provision for special political missions under the relevant sections of the programme budget. They should include charges arising from decisions of both the Security Council and the General Assembly, as well as those resulting from recourse to provisions of the Assembly resolution on unforeseen and extraordinary expenditures. The estimate for open-ended entities, such as monitoring mechanisms, expert groups or the Counter-Terrorism Committee, should be presented in the proposed programme budget and not through the report on estimates. Prior to approval of the proposed programme budget by the Assembly, the Secretary-General could update his estimates by indicating expired and/or new mandates. 6. The comments of the Advisory Committee in its report of 4 March 2002 (A/56/7/Add.8) concerning presentation and the need for adequate justification of resource requirements remain valid. While the Committee welcomes the changes made pursuant to its recommendations, it considers that further improvements are needed to enhance clarity, to fully justify requirements and to promote transparency and consistency in the presentation of estimates for various items of expenditure. 7. In its report of 4 March 2002, the Advisory Committee emphasized the importance of full justification of resource requirements and stressed that the provision of detailed information to the Security Council did not absolve Secretariat officials of responsibility for fully justifying the resources requested from the General Assembly. The Committee notes that the situation has not changed much. In paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/57/23), for example, an additional post is requested "in view of the intensification of the peace process and the corresponding increase in workload". Such general statements often slow the work of the Committee, as they must be explained in hearings or elaborated on through additional information in writing. At a time when the Advisory Committee is pressed to complete its work to meet Fifth Committee deadlines, ferreting out additional information in writing often takes too much time. 8. For its consideration of the matter, the Advisory Committee was provided with the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/57/23), as well as a document containing supplementary information. In the report of the Secretary-General, the narrative for each mission is divided into two sections, dealing with (a) background, mandate and objective and (b) resource requirements. The supplementary information provided to the Committee is in much the same format as that of past reports of the Secretary-General. The Committee requests that, in the future, the programme information and information on related resources, which are contained in the supplementary information, be incorporated into the main document. Future reports should also contain a general table arranged by object of expenditure. In the meantime, the Committee recommends that the supplementary information be provided to the Fifth Committee in a conference room paper, pending its publication in an addendum to the report of the Secretary-General. It is the intention of the Committee to follow up on the issue of how best to present the budgets of the missions concerned. 9. The Advisory Committee notes that the introduction to the report of the Secretary-General has been formulated along the lines requested by the Committee (see A/56/7/Add.8, para. 6). In the future, however, an effort should be made to provide a more informative and analytical introduction, incorporating general thematic information on developments, since the last report, regarding mandate implementation and plans for the future. In this connection, it would have been useful to include information on developments in such areas as those touched upon in the statement by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs to the Committee on 25 February 2002 (ibid., annex I) and in the lessons learned and recommendations of the joint review mission on the United Nations post-conflict peace-building support offices, which were communicated to the Committee and included in its report of 4 March 2002 (see A/56/7, Add.8, para. 12). For example, the Committee would have liked follow-up information on the implementation of paragraph 12 (d) of document A/56/7/Add.8, which cites the "importance of an explicit delineation of responsibilities and functions between the peace-building office and the rest of the country team". Furthermore, issues of coordination between the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council on matters related to peace-building activities and programmes need to be addressed so as to ensure maximum efficiency and optimum use of resources. 10. Moreover, in future reports, information on collaboration with other partners should be more specific, particularly as regards peace-building and assistance missions, such as those in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau and Tajikistan. It is essential to show how burden-sharing in respect of the cost of activities and services contributes to the implementation of mandates and the optimum use of resources. 11. The Advisory Committee was informed that, in the future, results-based budgeting techniques would be used in the report. The Committee welcomes this approach and requests that such presentations be made where appropriate, such as for peace-building and assistance missions. 12. Staffing requirements for 2003, as shown in table 3 of A/C.5/57/23, total 1,393 posts, as against 1,034 authorized for 2002. The largest changes in staffing relate to the conversion of 71 national officers and 275 local staff of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and 5 local staff of the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia from local contractor status. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the staffing of the missions included eight United Nations Volunteers not shown in table 3, two in the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in the Central African Republic and six in the United Nations Mission in Angola. 13. From the supplementary information provided, the Advisory Committee notes that of the estimated total requirements of $82,764,400 for special political missions, staff costs amount to approximately $56 million. Further, of the $56 million, staff costs for UNAMA account for $22.2 million. Upon request, the Committee was provided with a table showing budgeted vacancy factors and actual vacancy rates realized (see annex II). Given the information on actual vacancy rates realized, as provided in the table, the Committee is of the opinion that the estimate for staff costs could be reduced. Accordingly, the Committee recommends the approval of an amount of $50 million under civilian personnel costs for the special political missions for the period up to December 2003. The Committee also requests that future reports contain a table similar to that in annex II below and that an effort be made to explain the reasons for vacancies. 14. The Advisory Committee notes that in the narratives of the two documents before it there are a number of references to human rights and public information activities. These are not always clearly identified in each of the missions in terms of programmes of activities and funding requirements. The additional information on human rights activities given to the Committee was not useful; it would have taken too much of the Committee's time to seek further clarification. In future submissions, the Committee expects full identification of human rights and all other programmes and their related resources. 15. The Advisory Committee received additional material on information activities, using the United Nations Office in Burundi as an example. In the short time available, the Committee was not able to verify that adequate efforts have been made to avoid duplication of activities between, for example, public relations activities and confidence-building measures, or support for local peace initiatives and local institutions in connection with the Burundi ceasefire negotiations (see para. 41 below). The Committee recommends that the use of resources for information activities be reviewed with a view to ensuring a focused approach that is designed to promote the work of the United Nations in the mission concerned. 16. The Advisory Committee is of the view that public information units are more appropriate for large missions. It is not cost-effective to set up mission information units for small missions, including monitoring mechanisms. Alternative approaches should be explored, including collaboration with advocacy mechanisms already in the area coming from the United Nations, its funds and programmes or from partners in the United Nations system. 17. The Advisory Committee was informed that the two larger political missions, namely, UNAMA and the United Nations Mission in Angola, were now being led by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The Advisory Committee welcomes this approach. In its opinion, support for these political missions will profit from economies of scale and the experience of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in managing peacekeeping operations. Furthermore, in the opinion of the Committee, the experience of the Department should be drawn upon in the preparation of budget submissions for the special political missions. 18. Upon enquiry as to whether all the political missions use the Department of Peacekeeping Operations for logistical support, the Advisory Committee was informed that some of the smaller missions were administered by the Executive Office of the Department of Political Affairs. The Committee is of the view that their management might benefit from closer cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The Committee recommends that the missions be treated in a consistent manner and that logistical support be provided through the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. In this connection, the Committee recalls paragraph 2.1 (j) of the Secretary-General's bulletin on functions and organization of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (ST/SGB/2000/9), in which it is stated that the Department is to provide logistic and administrative support for peacekeeping operations, as well as other field offices and missions, as required. 19. Support by the Department of Political Affairs appears to be somewhat scattered. Support for the various committees and monitoring mechanisms should be streamlined and integrated in the Secretariat. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with information concerning Secretariat support for expert groups established by the Security Council in connection with sanctions (see annex III) and for existing sanctions regimes (see annex IV). 20. The Advisory Committee notes from this information that a total of 28 posts (12 Professional and 16 General Service) are proposed for the various mechanisms described in the annexes. Furthermore, the Committee recalls that under the programme budget for 2002-2003, the Security Council Affairs Division showed a staffing table of 50 regular budget posts for supporting the Council, including its sanctions activities. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the 17 staff shown in annex IV form part of the core staffing of the Department of Political Affairs/Security Council Affairs Division. The 11 positions shown in annex III below are temporary positions valid only for the mandate periods of the monitoring mechanisms or panels. The Committee questions the apparent practice of automatically establishing additional secretariat support capacity every time the Council establishes an entity. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the present arrangements to support the Council be reviewed in the context of the proposed programme budget for 2004-2005 with a view to streamlining these arrangements and, where appropriate, that the various support capacities be integrated so as to introduce efficiency into their activities and optimize the use of staff and other support services. Furthermore, the Committee expects a reduction in the number of posts shown in the annexes in view of the pending termination of some of the entities. 21. The Advisory Committee enquired whether the deficiencies in assets management and control in special political missions, which were cited in the report of the Board of Auditors on the United Nations1 had been eliminated. It was informed that, beyond the measures already taken by the missions and cited in the report of the Board of Auditors,2 the following actions have been taken: (a) United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan (UNSMA) assets are being transferred to UNAMA. All UNSMA property and records are being moved to Kabul. The estimated completion date for technical liquidation is 31 December 2002; (b) Regarding UNAMA property control, the physical asset inspection and verification project has been completed at all locations occupied by UNAMA, including liaison offices in Islamabad and Tehran and at the district offices in Faizabad and Maimana. The details on all non-expendable equipment have been recorded. Inventory records are currently being updated. III. Illustrative comments on specific missions A. Counter-Terrorism Committee 22. As indicated in paragraph 69 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/57/23), the estimated requirements relating to the Counter-Terrorism Committee for the one-year period from 1 January to 31 December 2003 amount to $2,909,500, of which $288,400 would be met from the estimated unencumbered balance at the end of December 2002. The Advisory Committee was informed that included in the estimates was an amount of $1,897,700 for the services of independent experts to review reports submitted by States pursuant to paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), covering travel ($284,900) and fees ($1,612,800) for an aggregate period of 168 months, or the equivalent of 14 experts for one year. The Committee was also informed that the Secretariat maintained a roster of 130 experts from which 6 had already been recruited, and the intention was to recruit more of them shortly. The qualifications sought in candidates include expertise in such areas as drafting of legislation, suppression of the financing of terrorist activities, money-laundering and immigration. Upon a request for further clarification of the composition and functions of the team of experts, the Committee was informed that one of its functions was to assist Governments in signing and ratifying conventions against terrorism. 23. The Advisory Committee is concerned that there may be potential for duplication as regards assistance to Governments. In this connection, the Committee recalls that in the report of the Secretary-General on strengthening the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the Secretariat, the focus of the Branch was identified as the provision of assistance to Member States, upon request, for ratifying and implementing the 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism (see A/57/152, summary). The Committee recommends that these arrangements be reviewed in order to avoid any possible overlap or duplication of functions. 24. Upon a request for a timetable of activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Counter-Terrorism Committee approves the work programme on a quarterly basis and reports periodically to the Security Council on its activities. The current work programme is outlined in the annex to document S/2002/1075. Further, in its presidential statement of 8 October 2002 (S/PRST/2002/26), the Council expressed its intention to review the structure and activities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee no later than 4 April 2003. The Advisory Committee requests that the forthcoming review take fully into account its recommendations as contained in A/56/7/Add.11. B. Monitoring Group established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1363 (2001) and extended pursuant to resolution 1390 (2002) 25. As indicated in paragraph 79 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/57/23), estimated requirements for the operation of the Monitoring Group to the end of 2003 amount to $2,106,000, of which $206,200 would be met from the estimated unencumbered balance expected to remain at the end of the current mandate period. Overall requirements for the Group to the end of 2003 therefore amount to $1,899,800. 26. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the five members of the Monitoring Group, including the Chairman, who is a former staff member, were appointed by the Secretary-General in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Security Council resolution 1363 (2001). The Chairman is remunerated at the D-1 level as a staff member, while the other four members of the group are treated as consultants and experts, for whose services $913,300 is requested. A total of $356,200 is requested for the official travel of the Chairman and other members of the Group. The Committee notes, as indicated in paragraph 75 of the report of the Secretary-General, that, by its resolution 1363 (2001), the Council decided that the monitoring mechanism should include a Monitoring Group composed of up to 5 experts and a Sanctions Enforcement Support Team of up to 15 members. 27. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Chairman of the Monitoring Group was appointed as a staff member "for administrative purposes only". The Committee questions this arrangement and expresses concern regarding its potential implications for the independence of the body and as a precedent for the future. C. United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan 28. As shown in table 2 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/57/23), $50,546,800 was appropriated for UNAMA for the biennium 2002-2003 for the period up to 28 March 2003. As stated in paragraph 88 of that report, estimated requirements for the additional nine months to the end of 2003 amount to $37,932,500, of which $9,617,500 would be met from the estimated unencumbered balance at the end of the current mandate period, resulting in overall requirements of $28,315,000 for the Mission through the end of 2003. 29. As shown in table 3 of the report of the Secretary-General, an increase in Mission staffing is requested, from 615 in 2002 to 958 in 2003. The Advisory Committee notes that this proposal includes an increase in local staff from 343 to 618. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that many of the staff concerned were on special service agreements, which were to be converted to established positions. The supplementary information provided to the Committee contains a proposal, for example, to convert 167 security guards from contractual status to United Nations (local level) posts. While the Committee understands that the change represents merely a change in status, this does not obviate the need to fully justify any such changes in terms of programme needs. The Advisory Committee was informed that other staffing changes included the abolition of 16 posts by 1 April 2003 and the addition of 8 security posts for close protection, 4 information technology posts and 1 programme manager post, for a net decrease of 3 international posts. The Committee was informed that the functions of the proposed security posts are currently being carried out by gratis personnel. The information on gratis personnel should have been provided in the relevant reports of the Secretary-General, including an indication of the extent to which the acceptance of such personnel was in compliance with relevant General Assembly resolutions on gratis personnel. 30. As shown in table 3 of the report of the Secretary-General, the estimates include an increase in the number of national officers in the Mission from 40 to 111. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the national officers would be employed in the Mission as follows: 9 in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, 6 under pillar I, 8 under pillar II, 20 for technical services, 26 for administrative services and 42 for area offices. In response to questions as to why the hiring of such a large number of national officers would not lead to a corresponding reduction in international staff, the Committee was informed that it was the ultimate goal of the exercise to reduce the number of international staff, but that it was a phased process involving developing the capacity of national staff (see para. 35 below). 31. The Advisory Committee was informed that the estimated requirements for staff costs for the period amounted to $22,241,100. Taking into account its recommendation in paragraph 13 above for a reduction of $6 million in staff costs ($2.4 million of which should come under UNAMA), as well as the $9.6 million underexpenditure in the current mandate period, the Committee recommends that, of the $37,932,500 (including carryover savings of $9.6 million) requested for UNAMA, $33.3 million be approved (including the $9.6 million in savings from the current mandate period). 32. The supplementary information provided to the Advisory Committee indicates that estimated operational requirements for the Mission amount to $14,131,700. The estimate includes a provision of $2.5 million for construction of a centralized Mission compound to house Mission headquarters staff and other participating United Nations agencies. The Committee requests that the impact of the construction on rental costs and other services be reflected in the next submission. 33. Air operations account for $4,280,800 of the estimated requirements for the Mission. The Advisory Committee was informed that the estimate would provide for the charter, hire and operating costs of one small passenger jet, one B-200 light aircraft and one medium passenger/cargo aircraft for the period from 1 April through 31 December 2003. The Committee recalls the concerns it expressed in its general report on peacekeeping operations of 5 April 2002 regarding the need to install an effective and adequate mission capacity to manage and monitor the use of air assets, as well as the need to have arrangements in place to ensure appropriate and timely reimbursement for air support services provided by missions to other partners in the mission area (A/56/887, para. 66). In this connection, the Committee enquired regarding the status of recruitment for the P-4 auditor's post that had been budgeted for the current period starting 1 April 2002. The Committee was informed that the Office of Internal Oversight Services was in the process of reviewing profiles and candidates and expected to appoint a resident auditor in the near future. This is a matter of serious concern and should be accorded high priority. 34. The Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information provided to it that the estimate for training amounts to $831,500. While the Committee agrees with the need for training, care should be taken to ensure that the goal of any training undertaken is to meet the specific needs of the Mission. The Committee therefore questions the need for training in such areas as critical thinking and public speaking. Furthermore, the Committee questions the justification for taking local staff out of Afghanistan to train them in Brindisi, and recommends that this issue be addressed in the context of the next budget submission. 35. In the supplementary information, it was also stated that the training of local and national personnel was part of a larger objective to develop the capacity of national staff to take over specific functions that are at present carried out by international staff. The Committee commends this objective and requests that in the next estimates the impact of this on the number of required international personnel be indicated. 36. The supplementary information provided to the Advisory Committee included a request for $300,000 for quick impact projects. In this connection, the Committee recalls the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the report of the Panel on United Nations peace operations (A/55/502). In the text preceding paragraph 25 of that report, the following recommendation of the Panel is reproduced: "A small percentage of a mission's first-year budget should be made available to the representative or special representative of the Secretary-General leading the mission to fund quick impact projects in its area of operations, with the advice of the United Nations country team's resident coordinator." Under the circumstances, and bearing in mind the presence of funds and programmes of the United Nations and other partners in the area, the Advisory Committee does not see the need to continue a separate provision under the regular budget for quick impact projects in UNAMA. D. United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia 37. The Advisory Committee notes from table 3 of the report of the Secretary-General that the estimates for the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Liberia include an increase of five local level posts. No information is given in the supplementary information provided to the Committee to justify the conversion of these positions to established posts, other than the fact that these individuals have been hired as local contractors for more than two years. Furthermore, neither the functions of the posts nor the programme justifications for the conversions are given. In fact, in this estimate and in the estimates for all the other special political missions, only generic titles are provided for positions to be filled; no functions are described. The Committee has commented on this problem in the past (see A/56/7/Add.8, paras. 14 and 21), yet no follow-up action has been taken to correct the weakness, except in the estimates for the United Nations Office in Burundi. Individuals employed for these temporary missions are not expected to have career appointments. The Committee recommends against the five conversions, which would lead to more expenditure without adding support capacity to the mission. E. United Nations Office in Burundi 38. As indicated in table 3 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/57/23), the estimated requirements include an increase in international staff from 28 to 30 and in local staff from 23 to 32, or a total increase from 51 to 62. The Advisory Committee acknowledges the developments in this area and the potential for expansion into a larger operational mission. The Committee appreciates the details provided in the supplementary information concerning the functions of the 11 new posts. These include a P-4 post for the chief information officer/spokesman and three local level support staff for a new Information Unit, one security officer, two secretaries for the Implementation Monitoring Committee, one switchboard operator, two drivers and a cleaner. The Committee notes further that in paragraph 50 of his report to the Security Council of 18 November 2002 (S/2002/1259), the Secretary-General states that "three military advisers and civilian police would also be attached to UNOB in order to continue contingency planning for the possible deployment of a United Nations peacekeeping mission". The Committee has no objection to the proposed increase in posts. However, the Committee notes that the vacancy rate assumed for international staff for 2002 was 25 per cent and that the current rate is 25.9 per cent. The estimates assume a vacancy rate of 5 per cent (see annex II). The Committee is therefore of the view that a higher vacancy factor should be applied. 39. The estimates for other resource requirements for the mission should have included more detailed justifications. For example, the supplementary information contains a request for $384,500 for the services of six international consultants, without adequate justification as to their functions. The same can be said of the estimate for operational costs ($1,083,700). Many of the unit rates used in this and other missions appear to the Committee to be too high and, in many cases, inconsistent. For example, in the supplementary information there is a request for $27,600 for the rental of six parking spaces. A provision is made for spare parts, repairs and maintenance at $158 per vehicle per month, or $1,896 per vehicle per year. However, for the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in the Central African Republic, the estimate is $1,540 per vehicle per year. Requirements for two facsimile machines for the Burundi Office are estimated at $4,400, while for the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes Region of Africa the estimate for a plain paper fax machine is $1,200 plus 15 per cent for shipping and handling. 40. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the items were mission-specific and that standard costs were not used in the estimates. The Committee requests that overall integrated procurement planning be undertaken for special political missions, with assistance from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, for equipment, vehicles and other items normally eligible for bulk procurement, with a view to introducing efficiency and optimum use of resources (see also para. 17 above). 41. As indicated in paragraph 15 above, the Committee received additional details on the information activities of the United Nations Office in Burundi. The Committee was informed that of the total estimate of $428,700, public information would amount to $153,800, confidence-building measures to $174,900 and Burundi ceasefire negotiations to $100,000. The Committee questions the rationale for providing what appears to the Committee to be either grants or lump sum amounts to various recipients in the Government and civil society. Unless care is taken and criteria are developed for such disbursements under the regular budget of the United Nations, the United Nations risks creating far more serious public relations problems, especially among groups that would consider themselves left out of United Nations assistance. The Committee recommends that the use of resources for public information activities be reviewed with a view to ensuring that such resources are used for those activities that are strictly designed to promote the work of the United Nations in Burundi. In the meantime, the Committee recommends $328,700 for public information, a reduction of $100,000. 42. Taking into account its comments in paragraphs 38, 39 and 41 above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the estimate for the Office be reduced from $7,556,600 to $6.8 million. F. United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Guinea-Bissau 43. The estimate for the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in Guinea-Bissau, as shown in table 2 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/C.5/57/23), reflects a decrease from $2,722,700 in 2002 to $2,586,400 in 2003. 44. As shown in table 3 of the report of the Secretary-General, a decrease in staffing from 28 to 27 is proposed. In addition, as indicated in paragraph 37 of the report, the upgrading of the post of administrative officer from the P-2 to the P-4 level is requested. The Committee was informed that the request resulted from a review by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, which concluded that the P-2 level was too low to provide adequate supervision over administrative and budgetary matters. While the Committee agrees with this request, it observes that effective assets management and budgetary control can be achieved when the individuals have the necessary experience and training. These qualities are not necessarily related to the level of the post. For special missions, it may be easier to recruit at lower levels, provide training and ensure long retention through the rotation of staff among missions. The essential requirement is for all concerned, including heads of missions and senior individuals in the mission, to be fully aware of the need to observe staff and personnel regulations and rules and to be held accountable for any deficiencies or management lapses. G. United Nations Mission in Angola 45. The resource requirements for the United Nations Mission in Angola for the period up to the end of 2003 amount to $12,575,700. Of this, $632,900 would be met from the estimated unencumbered balance at the end of the current mandate period. Staffing of the Mission would be reduced by one D-2 post -- that of the head of the predecessor mission, the United Nations Office in Angola -- as the new Mission is headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the Under-Secretary-General level. H. United Nations Peace-building Support Office in the Central African Republic 46. The estimate for the United Nations Peace-building Support Office in the Central African Republic amounts to $4,548,400 for 2003, as compared with the estimate of $4,628,500 for 2002. The number of posts remains at 56. The Advisory Committee welcomes the additional information provided, which describes the programme of activities of the Office and related costs. The additional information indicated that the cost of the political programme of the Office would amount to $58,000, the military and civilian programmes to $51,800, the public information programme to $110,500, the training programme to $25,400 and the human rights programme to $161,000. The Committee recalls its comments in its report of 4 March 2002 (A/56/7/Add.8, paras. 6 and 18) and notes that the additional information given to the Committee is not clear as regards the actual plans and targets and corresponding performance. For example, in political programmes, the same amount ($58,000) is requested as was for the previous period (see A/C.5/56/25, annex VII, para. 20), and the narrative of the supplementary information provided to the Committee for 2003 is more or less the same as the narrative in the previous report of the Secretary-General. The same situation is true for the civilian police programme. 47. From the information provided, it is often difficult to ascertain the basis of the request for programme resources and the achievements thus far; nor is it much easier to ascertain the planned targets for proposed resources. For example, the statement given in the additional information provided to the Committee that "various training programmes will be conducted on a number of issues at an estimated cost of $42,300" is not very useful. 48. Such observations as those contained in paragraphs 46 and 47 above are valid for many of the programmes of the peace-building missions. It should be possible, in the context of country team strategies, to identify, for example, the target for training under civilian police programmes and the cost involved in accomplishing the target, to be funded from various sources, including bilateral programmes. The Committee requests that in the next estimates this issue be addressed for programmes in this and other missions. IV. Conclusions 49. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee in paragraphs 13, 31 and 42 above would require a total reduction of $8,989,100 in the Secretary-General's estimate of $82,764,400 (net). Accordingly, the Advisory Committee recommends approval of an additional expenditure amount of $60,039,000 after taking into account the estimated unencumbered balance of $13,736,300 for the current mandate periods. This amount would be reflected in the first performance report for incorporation within the revised appropriations for the biennium 2002-2003.
