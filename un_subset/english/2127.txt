UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL A/52/800 S/1998/149 23 February 1998 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH GENERAL ASSEMBLY SECURITY COUNCIL Fifty-second session Fifty-third year Agenda item 61 QUESTION OF CYPRUS Letter dated 23 February 1998 from the Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Upon instructions from my Government, I have the honour to draw your attention to a new violation of the flight information region of Nicosia by two military aircraft of the Turkish Air Force on 26 January 1998. On that day, at 13.30 hours, two Turkish F-16 military planes entered the Nicosia flight information region from a north-westerly direction, exiting at 14.26 in a northerly direction. As stated in my previous letters, such unauthorized intrusions into the Nicosia flight information region are in violation of international law and international air traffic regulations. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, I wish to protest strongly against the new violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, which is in complete disregard of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant Security Council resolutions. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the fifty-second session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 61, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Sotirios ZACKHEOS Ambassador, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Cyprus to the United Nations
