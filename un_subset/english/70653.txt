Subregional activities for development Legislative mandates 16.1 The mandate of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which is derived from Economic and Social Council resolutions 37 (IV) and 414 (XIII) by which the Commission was established, is to promote regional cooperation for inclusive and sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific. The role of the Commission was subsequently elaborated upon in various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Commission itself. 16.2 This strategic framework covers the first biennium of the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015 (as and when approved by the General Assembly). Its strategic direction is derived from internationally agreed development mandates, including the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, which emphasized the role of the regional commissions in promoting the balanced integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development; General Assembly resolution 67/226 on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, which called for the adoption of collaborative approaches to support country-level development initiatives; and Commission resolution 69/1 on a conference structure of the Commission for the inclusive and sustainable development of Asia and the Pacific. 16.3 Home to nearly two thirds of the world's population, Asia and the Pacific is also the largest regional economy. Despite the lingering impact of the global financial crisis, Asia stands firm as the centre of the global economic recovery; serves as the hub of international trade, investment and technology transfer; and has succeeded in eliminating half of the world's absolute poverty. Drawing on these foundations, the region stands at the cusp of its next large transformation as it rethinks and reinvests in itself, and rebalances economies towards greater reliance on domestic and regional demand to sustain economic dynamism and close infrastructural and development gaps. 16.4 Despite such progress, most of the world's poor and hungry still reside in the region. Poverty is not only prevalent in the least developed countries, but also in many middle-income countries. As benefits from economic growth continue to be distributed unevenly, increasing inequality between and within countries continues to pose a key challenge. With many workers remaining in vulnerable employment and millions of youths looking for jobs, creation of decent and productive jobs remains a priority. Economic insecurity is heightened by limited social protection coverage within much of the region. Eradication of poverty, balanced integration of the three pillars of sustainable development and promotion of inclusive economic and social policies to address these challenges will continue to be core priorities for ESCAP. 16.5 Economic growth coupled with changing patterns of production and consumption has increased the exploitation of natural resources and taken a severe toll on the region's natural environment. The need to develop and implement sound green economy policies in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, including shared solutions across the region to ensure equitable access to sustainable water and energy resources, will continue to be crucial to the Commission's regional cooperation efforts. 16.6 Asia and the Pacific continues to be the region most prone to disasters, including those events impacted by climate change. Increased economic integration has heightened the risk that a natural disaster in one country can have significant repercussions elsewhere. Adaptation to climate change and mitigation of its impacts in the context of inclusive and sustainable development will continue to be a priority, especially in the small island developing States of the Pacific, where the sustainable development of ocean resources provides a crucial basis for livelihoods. 16.7 Despite some progress towards attainment of gender equality in areas such as education, women across the region remain marginalized in public life; are less likely than men to own assets or participate in non-agricultural wage employment; tend to be heavily concentrated in the informal sector; and carry a disproportionate burden of unpaid domestic work. Gender-based violence remains a pervasive threat to the well-being of women and girls everywhere. Effectively addressing the many forms of gender inequality remains an essential component of advancing inclusive development. 16.8 Development efforts have been hampered by the lack of basic statistics about the social, economic and environmental circumstances in which people live. To address this, there is a need for effective, open and accountable institutions supported by administrative systems and processes, such as civil registration. Effective governance and accountability depend on a well-functioning and capable national statistical system that is able to produce and disseminate high quality official statistics. Statistical capacity-building will remain a key priority for the region's cooperation efforts. 16.9 Given these opportunities, as well as persisting and emerging challenges, it is imperative that the region works together effectively to forge a development paradigm that builds on the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals; puts the balanced integration of the three pillars of sustainable development at the core; leaves no one behind; balances State and market roles to promote jobs and inclusive growth; and builds open and accountable institutions that are responsive to the emerging voices of non-State actors. Critical to this agenda will be the development of new policy frameworks and regional instruments to generate more sustainable economic growth; strengthen regional economic integration; enhance connectivity in areas including infrastructure, information and communications technology, trade and transport; close development and equity gaps; improve governance; strengthen resilience to natural and economic shocks; and build on past achievements by lifting further hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and continuing to help countries with special needs to implement their respective programmes of action. 16.10 ESCAP provides the region's most inclusive intergovernmental platform to facilitate the collective policy leadership and cooperation required to effectively seize these opportunities and address shared challenges. ESCAP will support member States by providing sound evidence-based strategic analysis, policy options and capacity development to implement innovative solutions for development that is inclusive, equitable, sustainable and resilient. In doing so, ESCAP will draw on the comparative advantages of its intergovernmental convening power; its regional norm-setting mandate and role; its multidisciplinary expertise and synergies across all divisions and offices; its role as a regional hub for sharing of development knowledge and lessons; network of subregional offices; and its ability to link subregions for mutual benefit. 16.11 The present strategic framework comprises eight mutually supportive and interconnected subprogrammes that reflect the priorities of member States. It builds on the achievements of the previous biennium and reflects the vital role of ESCAP in implementing the development pillar of the United Nations, while focusing on enhanced organizational effectiveness and attainment of measurable results. 16.12 During the biennium, efforts will be intensified to mainstream gender equality across all subprogrammes in line with commitments under the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. The rights of persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups will likewise be a key driver across all aspects of programme implementation. 16.13 Effective partnerships, including with subregional organizations, other United Nations agencies, the business sector and civil society, will continue to be strengthened in order to ensure coherent approaches to addressing regional priorities. To this end, ESCAP will reinforce its role as the convener of the AsiaPacific Regional Coordination Mechanism. In concert with the other regional commissions, ESCAP will also continue to promote interregional cooperation for inclusive and sustainable development and ensure that regional perspectives effectively influence global policy processes. Subprogramme 1 Macroeconomic policy and inclusive development Objective of the Organization: To enhance regional economic cooperation and foster forward-looking macroeconomic policymaking for inclusive and sustainable development, especially in support of poverty reduction and attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including the development agenda beyond 2015 (as and when approved by the General Assembly) Expected accomplishments of the Secretariat Indicators of achievement (a) Enhanced understanding among policymakers and other target groups of policies that promote economic growth, reduce poverty and narrow development gaps in the region (a) Number of review articles and references to ESCAP publications and other activities by Governments, academia and the media (b) Enhanced regional voice in global development forums and strengthened economic and financial cooperation to foster inclusive, equitable, sustainable and resilient development (b) Number of outcome documents and resolutions reflecting consensus on regional economic and financial cooperation (c) Improved capacity of member States, particularly countries with special needs, to design and implement development policies for achieving the development agenda beyond 2015 (as and when approved by the General Assembly) and other internationally agreed development goals, including gender equality (c) Percentage of surveyed participants indicating that they are better able to design and implement development policies, including those that are gender responsive (d) Improved capacity of member States to formulate and implement rural development policies and measures that promote sustainable agriculture and food security for the equitable benefit of women and men, girls and boys (d) Percentage of surveyed participants indicating that they have used knowledge and skills obtained from the work of ESCAP to promote sustainable agriculture and food security for the equitable benefit of women and men, girls and boys Strategy 16.14 The substantive responsibility for the subprogramme is vested in the Macroeconomic Policy and Development Division, with support from the Centre for Alleviation of Poverty through Sustainable Agriculture.

It will also be guided by the post-2015 development agenda (as and when approved by the General Assembly). During the biennium, the subprogramme will support member States in working towards the vision of an international, integrated, intermodal transport and logistics system connecting the Asian and Pacific region. It will do this by supporting member States in their efforts to integrate the regional transport networks, including by continuing to act as the secretariat for the intergovernmental agreements governing the Asian Highway network, Trans-Asian Railway network and dry ports. In particular, the subprogramme will support the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States in their efforts to develop and upgrade their transport networks, including through public-private partnerships and private-sector involvement in infrastructure projects. In line with the Regional Action Programme, the secretariat will also continue to focus on improving inter-island shipping in archipelagic and island countries. Special consideration will be given to mainstreaming gender considerations into the subprogramme. 16.23 To enhance the operational efficiency of regional transport networks, the subprogramme will assist member States' efforts to identify and implement measures to address non-physical bottlenecks, conduct training to improve the performance of logistics industry and related transport services and promote improved connectivity between subregions. The subprogramme will also assist member States in designing and implementing transport policies that support inclusive, equitable, sustainable and resilient development. These include modal shifts from roads to railways and other more fuel-efficient means; greater use of public transport, particularly in urban areas; improvement of road safety; and policies to improve access to transport for all members of society. Such policies will also be responsive to the different needs and interests of women and men, and strengthen rural transport planning and rural-urban linkages. 16.24 The Transport Division will strengthen cooperation with other international, regional and subregional organizations as well as other regional commissions and transport associations that are active in the development of the region's transport systems.

The subprogramme is guided by the Committee on Statistics, the relevant subsidiary body of the Commission that forms the basis for regional consensus-building for action and represents an effective mechanism for contributing to global mandates. The subprogramme derives its mandate from the two overarching strategic goals of the Committee on Statistics, namely, (a) ensuring that all countries in the region by 2020 have the capability to provide an agreed basic range of population, economic, social and environment statistics, and (b) creating a more adaptive and cost-effective information management environment for national statistical offices through stronger collaboration. 16.38 The subprogramme will aim to improve the availability, quality and use of statistics in support of good governance for equitable, sustainable, inclusive and resilient societies in Asia and the Pacific. The strategy will focus on using core sets of statistics to focus national efforts, coordinate regional cooperation and mobilize support by all relevant development partners for national statistical capacity strengthening. Coordinated regional and in-country training, including the regular programme of training of the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific, is a main pillar of regional initiatives of statistical capacity strengthening. More broadly, the subprogramme will continue to work closely with the Partners for Statistics Development in Asia-Pacific, a grouping of international, regional and bilateral organizations, to improve the combined impact of capacity-building activities through enhanced coordination, synergy and complementarity among partners. 16.39 Within the overall programme of work, the subprogramme will also link its work closely with that of other subprogrammes to support evidence-based policy analyses and advocacy. Capitalizing on the diversity in the region, the subprogramme will emphasize sharing of knowledge, experiences and solutions in developing and implementing regional initiatives to strengthen national statistical capacity. The subprogramme will make full use of the opportunities arising from the increased capacities of member States as centres of expertise and providers of development assistance, including through South-South cooperation modalities. The subprogramme will make conscious efforts to adapt its approaches to specific country circumstances and needs of member States. For least developed member States with more acute and widespread needs, this often means targeted support. 16.40 The subprogramme will also seek collaboration with subregional institutions for effective implementation of regional initiatives and improved statistical integration.
