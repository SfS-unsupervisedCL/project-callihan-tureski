Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on assistance in mine action; 2. Calls, in particular, for the continuation of the efforts of States, with the assistance of the United Nations and relevant organizations involved in mine action, as appropriate, to foster the establishment and development of national mine-action capacities in countries in which mines and explosive remnants of war constitute a serious threat to the safety, health and lives of the local civilian population or an impediment to social and economic development efforts at the national and local levels; 3. Urges all States, in particular those that have the capacity to do so, as well as the United Nations system and relevant organizations and institutions involved in mine action, as appropriate, to provide: (a) Assistance to countries affected by mines and explosive remnants of war for the establishment and development of national mine-action capacities; (b) Support for national programmes, where appropriate, in cooperation with the relevant bodies of the United Nations system and relevant regional, governmental and non-governmental organizations, to reduce the risks posed by landmines and explosive remnants of war, taking into consideration the differing impacts on women, men, girls and boys; (c) Reliable, predictable and timely contributions for mine-action activities, including through national mine-action efforts and mine-action programmes of nongovernmental organizations, including those relating to victim assistance and mine risk education, especially at the local level, as well as through the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action and relevant regional trust funds for assistance in mine action; (d) Necessary information and technical, financial and material assistance to locate, remove, destroy and otherwise render ineffective minefields, mines, booby traps, other devices and explosive remnants of war, in accordance with international law, as soon as possible; (e) Technological assistance (i) to countries affected by mines and explosive remnants of war; and (ii) to promote user-oriented scientific research on and development of mine-action techniques and technology that are effective, sustainable, appropriate and environmentally sound; 4.

Encourages all relevant multilateral, regional and national programmes and bodies to include, in coordination with the United Nations, activities related to mine action, including mine clearance, in their humanitarian, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development assistance activities, where appropriate, bearing in mind the need to ensure national and local ownership, sustainability and capacity-building, as well as to include a gender and age-appropriate perspective in all aspects of such activities; 8.

Recognizes the importance of explicitly incorporating references to mine action, when appropriate, in ceasefire and peace agreements in light of the potential that mine action can have as a peace and confidence-building measure in post-conflict situations among parties concerned; 10.
