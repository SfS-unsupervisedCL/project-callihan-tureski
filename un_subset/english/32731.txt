* E/2005/100. Substantive session of 2005 New York, 29 June-27 July 2005 Item 2 of the provisional agenda* Achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, as well as implementing the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits: progress made, challenges and opportunities Statement submitted by Foundation for Research on Technology Migration and Integration, a non-governmental organization in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council The Secretary-General has received the following statement, which is being circulated in accordance with paragraphs 36 and 37 of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31. Information technology is a key factor for socio-economic development. For 20 years, FORMIT has been committed to supporting the use of technology to drive socio-economic development and to maintain social, cultural, environmental and economic sustainability through Target 18 of MDG 8 (Develop a global partnership for development). Supporting non-G8 countries in technology transfer The objective of the International Programme for non-G8 Countries was to improve the capacity of non-G8 countries to exploit technologies for socio-economic development, balancing the relationship between public administration's contracting authorities and technology suppliers. The 60 representatives from 30 countries confirmed the importance of ICT for socio-economic and civil development, highlighting a set of recommendations for action: (1) "One dollar for development": E-Government Application Reuse should be promoted as a tool to support socio-economic development, bridging the North-South digital gap, and to increase the availability of decent and productive work for youth; (2) A price observatory on telecommunications (TLC)/ICT Hardware and Services and on Health-care High Tech Systems should be implemented as an instrument to support negotiations of non-G8 countries with multinational technology suppliers; (3) Technical, organizational and legal expertise should be made available upon request to support non-G8 countries in technology procurement processes. Outcome implemented FORMIT has already established a free-of-charge, online open service to provide this expertise to promote reuse of e-Government applications. The proposal to be implemented through multi-stakeholder, not-for-profit partnerships under the United Nations umbrella will make available to non-G8 countries successful e-Government applications of collective interest developed by donor countries, which can be deployed with minimum technical effort and will identify: :: The real needs in terms of ICT innovation for development of receiving non-G8 countries; :: The socio-economic, cultural, technological and institutional scenarios of receiving countries. Building a strong global partnership for development through One dollar for development, as envisaged by the MDG 8, requires a strong political commitment from Member States who could adopt e-Government application reuse as an official development support measure, indicating a way to support the multi-stakeholder initiative involving: :: Donor countries and their governmental administrations, to identify reusable eGovernment applications; :: Non-G8 countries, to be fully involved in the process of reusing and transferring of applications, contributing with their needs, planning, state-of-the-art technology, competencies; :: Civil society and corporate sector, which would contribute to the initiative, ruled by principles of corporate responsibility and social, cultural, environmental and technical sustainability. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat could coordinate the proposed multi-stakeholder partnerships for identifying and structuring needs and supporting the innovation planning process, motivating donor countries, supporting capacity-building and knowledge transfer, and making available successful e-Government applications of collective interest at no cost, including the setting up of an ad hoc voluntary membership e-Government technical group supported by FORMIT in the role of a catalyst, which will manage the local application installation through its final stage, guaranteeing for the success of the technological transfer process.
