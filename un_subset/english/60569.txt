The Council also provided for the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to report to the Council regularly on the movements of armed groups and on information concerning arms supply and the presence of foreign military, especially by monitoring the use of landing strips in North and South Kivu and Ituri. 4. By its resolution 1533 (2004), the Security Council established the Committee, inter alia, (a) to seek information from States regarding implementation of the arms embargo; (b) to examine and take action on alleged violations; (c) to report to the Council on ways to strengthen the arms embargo; (d) to consider a list of those found to have violated the measures imposed by the Council in its resolution 1493 (2003) with a view to submitting recommendations to the Council for possible future measures; and (e) to receive notifications in advance from States made under paragraph 21 of resolution 1493 (2003) and to decide, if need be, upon any action to be taken. 5. By paragraph 10 of its resolution 1533 (2004), the Security Council requested the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Committee, to establish a Group of Experts to monitor the arms embargo. The Group of Experts was re-established or extended for 11 successive mandates pursuant to resolutions 1552 (2004), 1596 (2005), 1616 (2005), 1654 (2006), 1698 (2006), 1771 (2007), 1799 (2008), 1807 (2008), 1857 (2008), 1896 (2009) and 1952 (2010). 6. By its resolution 1596 (2005), the Security Council extended the arms embargo to any recipient in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with exemptions including the army and police of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, under conditions set out in the resolution.

In addition to the tasks outlined in resolutions 1533 (2004), 1596 (2005) and 1649 (2005), the Council requested the Group to recommend feasible and effective measures the Council might impose to prevent the illegal exploitation of natural resources financing armed groups. In paragraph 8 of its resolution 1698 (2006), the Council also requested the Secretary-General to present before 15 February 2007, in close consultation with the Group of Experts, a report comprising an assessment of the potential economic, humanitarian and social impact on the population of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the implementation of the possible measures referred to in paragraph 6 of the resolution. 9.
