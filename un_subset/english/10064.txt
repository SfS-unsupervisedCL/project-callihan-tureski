Having consistently advocated a peaceful settlement of the crisis through dialogue, the Government of Mali demands that the provisions of the Abuja Agreement of 1 November 1998 and the additional protocol signed at Lomé on 15 December 1998, provisions that guarantee peace and democracy for Guinea-Bissau, be respected. The Government of Mali calls for this political agreement and the process of national reconciliation set out therein to be implemented so that a free and democratic general election can be held in Guinea-Bissau in accordance with the Constitution.
