Resource performance* A. Department of Peacekeeping Operations 1. Results-based-budgeting framework (a) Office of the Under-Secretary-General Expected accomplishment 1.1: improved reporting to the Security Council, the General Assembly, other intergovernmental bodies and troop-contributing countries to enable fully informed decisions on issues relating to peacekeeping Planned outputs Completed (number or yes/no) Remarks Front Office of the Under-Secretary-General Report of the Secretary-General to the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, substantive Secretariat support to the Special Committee and the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly, and briefings in response to all requests by the Special Committee and the Fourth Committee Yes A report of the Secretary-General to the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (A/64/573) was issued on 22 December 2009 and was accompanied by a detailed matrix (A/64/573/Add.1) outlining action taken to implement the recommendations set out in the 2009 report of the Special Committee and its Working Group (A/63/19) Secretariat support provided included: substantive advice to the Bureau of the Special Committee; summaries of the annual general debate of the Fourth Committee on peacekeeping; procedural and substantive assistance to the Chair of the Special Committee during more than 80 informal Committee briefings given by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support during the 2009/10 period 45 briefings to the Security Council, the General Assembly and legislative bodies on developments in peacekeeping missions and on cross-cutting strategic, policy and structural issues related to peacekeeping Briefings and reports to the Security Council, the General Assembly and legislative bodies (including the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions) 260 meetings with briefings to Member States, regional organizations and groups of friends/contact groups on all aspects of peacekeeping Briefings provided to Member States, regional organizations and groups of friends/contact groups, on all aspects of peacekeeping 12 visits to key troop- and police-contributing countries and other Member States to develop strategic partnerships and build common approaches to support United Nations peacekeeping Visits made to key troop- and police-contributing countries to develop strategic partnerships. Increased output was due to operational requirements, including with respect to the crisis in Haiti; discussions with host Governments about the configuration of future peacekeeping presences; and discussions on the New Horizon agenda Public Affairs Unit Outreach activities targeting key policymakers, academics, military, civil society and non-governmental organizations Outreach activities/public briefings targeting policymakers, experts, academics, military personnel, civil society and non-governmental organizations Multimedia exhibition of peacekeeping operations at United Nations information centres in 3 major troop-contributing countries No A multimedia exhibit on peacekeeping operations was presented in China during the Shanghai World Expo 2010. Lower output was due to the shift in resources in response to the crisis in Haiti following the earthquake in January 2010, and the related need to respond to increased press requests and prioritized media relations. A multimedia exhibit with the theme "Haiti standing" was launched at Headquarters for the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers in May 2010. In addition, a multimedia archive was developed on the earthquake in Haiti, capturing the events that occurred at the time of the earthquake and in the months that followed. The archive, which is accessible to the public, includes approximately 700 photos, 500 videos and more than 150 transcripts 2 documentaries on peacekeeping, including briefings to film-makers and logistical arrangements for travel to field missions Documentary projects: (a) in collaboration with the Department of Public Information and peacekeeping missions, the Culture Project's short film The War against War, on United Nations peacekeeping; (b) a television programme produced by Defence TV of the South African Department of Defence, on the involvement of South Africa in United Nations peacekeeping in Africa; (c) the FireAnts Productions web/television documentary series We are going to the World Cup, showcasing how peacekeepers use sports to engage with local communities. Increased output was due to the demand for coverage of peacekeeping stories and the prioritization given to media relations Opinion editorials and letters to the editor in response to key articles on mission-critical issues Opinion editorials were not prepared during the reporting period, owing to the need to respond to the increased number of press requests and the prioritization given to media relations, particularly during the crisis in Haiti Quarterly briefings to the United Nations press corps on progress and developments on major peacekeeping issues by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support senior management Quarterly press briefings (4 each by the Under-Secretaries-General of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support) were given to the media on recent developments in peacekeeping missions. In addition, 1 press briefing was given following the release of the Board of Inquiry report on the bombing of the United Nations guesthouse in Kabul, 1 press briefing was given following the earthquake in Haiti, and 20 press briefings were given during a video teleconference with MINUSTAH senior leadership following the earthquake in Haiti 6 media interviews organized on evolving areas of peacekeeping activity, including conduct and discipline, military, police, rule of law, security sector reform and protection of civilians 50 media interviews were organized during the reporting period, on issues such as the elections in the Sudan and Afghanistan; the protection of civilians in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Sudan and Somalia; police training in Haiti and Liberia; the strengthening of the prison system in Liberia; and conduct and discipline cases and safety and security in missions (including carjackings, abductions and the ambush of peacekeepers in Darfur, and the bombing of the United Nations guesthouse in Kabul). Increased output was due to ongoing proactive media relations and the need to respond to high-profile news events that occurred in mission areas during the reporting period. In addition, more than 150 interviews and background briefings were given by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support following the earthquake in Haiti Survey report on the views and opinions of target audiences in 3 troop-contributing countries, and 2 host countries to assist in the development of communications objectives and priority needs for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support The first phase of the survey, targeting 3 troop-contributing countries, was completed in May 2010. The second phase of the survey, targeting 2 host countries, will be implemented during the 2010/11 period. The procurement contract was issued in June 2009, as reported in the 2008/09 performance report. Therefore, phase I was postponed until the 2009/10 period, delaying phase II until the current budgetary period Situation Centre Immediate notifications to troop-contributing countries of all casualties among uniformed personnel serving 152 casualties among uniformed personnel were recorded during the reporting period, affecting 33 Member States, all of which were informed of casualties within 24 hours of the receipt of the notification of casualty from the mission in question 40 verbal and written briefings to troop-contributing countries on operational developments During the reporting period, 37 weekly briefings for Member States on operational developments were provided to the military and police advisers community. In addition, 2 ad hoc briefings were provided to troop- and police-contributing countries through the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations All Situation Centre briefing notes, flash reports and updates uploaded on the Joint Situation Centres portal shared with NATO and the European Union All 251 Situation Centre briefing notes and 116 flash reports and updates were uploaded to the shared portal Expected accomplishment 2.1: rapid deployment and establishment of peacekeeping operations in response to Security Council mandates In collaboration with the Department of Public Information and the Department of Field Support, outreach strategy and implementation plan for the creation of new candidate pools for specialized public information functions in missions Because of the ongoing human resource reforms, in particular new policies affecting recruitment for field missions, an outreach strategy and an implementation plan were not developed, owing to the priority placed on updating the current rosters on Galaxy. This process was completed in July 2010. Testing, expert panel interviews and a final evaluation of the first group of 339 candidates who had applied for public information posts on Galaxy was undertaken as part of the exercise. The selected candidates were reviewed by the Field Central Review Board, and public information rosters were created. As a result, approximately 45 candidates for public information posts have been placed on the roster. An outreach effort to expand the pool of qualified public information candidates, in collaboration with the Department of Public Information and the Department of Field Support, is planned for completion during the 2011/12 period Technical assessment missions, predeployment missions and/or mission start-up field visits to assess security conditions in 6 Department of Peacekeeping Operations-led field missions Lower output was due to the requirement for only 1 technical assessment visit to UNMIS, to conduct a pilot test of the United Nations security level system. The test supported the full development of the system, as well as its approval by the Chief Executives Board Expected accomplishment 3.1: increased efficiency and effectiveness of peacekeeping operations 10 visits to peacekeeping missions to review progress and provide direction to mission leadership on issues related to the implementation of mission mandates MINURCAT, MINUSTAH (3), MONUC (3), UNFICYP, UNIFIL and UNMIS 30 business processes improvement projects completed, using the Lean Six Sigma methodology Lean Six Sigma projects were completed: contingent-owned equipment reimbursement, field financial systems application upgrade, asset disposal plan, national competitive recruitment examination, sick leave certification, troop strength reporting, voluntary trust fund assistance, request for service from the Office of Information and Communications Technology, guidance approval and publication in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support. 2 additional projects, on designation and communications related to senior mission appointments, were completed in August and September 2010, respectively Lower output was due to the temporary suspension of the joint business process improvement initiative by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field Support and the Department of Management, following the decision to focus on the enterprise resource planning initiative. Additionally, priority was placed on other improvement initiatives and projects, such as the global field support strategy, the talent management initiative in the context of greater human resource reforms, the introduction of IPSAS and the senior management compact Web-based training course developed and in-person training and outreach to all records management officers, assistants and focal points in all peacekeeping missions in the application and implementation of peacekeeping-specific records management tools and guidelines Training materials on records management and information sensitivity were developed and made available to all records management officers, assistants and focal points through the peacekeeping records management community of practice In addition, a 4-day training workshop was delivered to 23 records management officers and assistants in Brindisi, Italy, in May 2010; basic records management training was delivered to UNLB information technology staff in June 2010; and records disposition training was delivered to 20 Department of Peacekeeping Operations/Department of Field Support records management focal points at Headquarters in November 2009 Standard template for field mission Intranet content developed, including mission-specific information and information useful to all peacekeeping staff An intranet template was developed in June 2010. In addition, a "peace operations mission intranet guide" was developed and finalized in July 2010 Standardized process maps developed for core business processes in peacekeeping operations related to information collection and reporting In the development of the strategic management system, process maps have been developed for all core information collection and reporting business processes related to information management: military affairs, geographic information systems, rule-of-law and security institutions, medical services, finance, personnel, logistics, mission situation reporting and fatalities reporting Collaboration sites for document and task management developed and launched for 7 organizational units, giving priority to areas responsible for the integration of core peacekeeping activities Organizational units including 7 integrated operational teams. To date, the system is actively used in only 2 of those organizational units, owing to technical problems relating to system performance, which were resolved in December 2010. Increased output was due to the request by other organizational units to use the collaboration site Information management governance guidelines developed for field missions, including information management responsibilities within peacekeeping operations and compliance with organizational information management standards and policies The following guidance was developed during the period 2009/10: standard operating procedures on access to and the declassification of archives and non-current records, revised and expanded to include field missions (April 2010), and an information sensitivity toolkit for field missions, jointly published by the Department of Management and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (February 2010) Conduct of a survey among all peacekeeping staff to assess perceptions on improvements to information management resources, with emphasis on the peace operations intranet and the peacekeeping electronic research package A survey for Headquarters and field staff of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support on peacekeeping information management products and services was developed in June 2010; however, as a result of the need to temporarily deploy resources to a project of greater priority (UNIFIL information management assessment) in June and July 2010, it was not issued and completed until August 2010 In close collaboration with the Department of Public Information, technical assessment visits to all new missions and missions undergoing significant adjustments, as well as peacekeeping operations facing significant public information challenges No new missions were established during the reporting period. With regard to missions undergoing significant adjustments, an assessment was conducted in MINUSTAH following the earthquake in Haiti, including to determine staffing and logistics needs for the public information component, as well as the media relations support required A joint assessment visit to the Sudan (UNAMID and UNMIS) was carried out with the Department of Public Information in June 2010 to meet with counterparts in the field and advise on the development of communications strategies ahead of the Sudan referenda, scheduled to be held in January 2011 In collaboration with the Department of Public Information and the Department of Field Support, review of communications responsibilities for supporting peacekeeping operations, including technical clearances for public information officers, asset procurement and the technical review and oversight of public information-related procurement contracts A review was undertaken through the Inter-departmental Working Group on Public Information Activities (including the Department of Public Information, the Department of Political Affairs, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support), which meets monthly. In addition, the Group met regularly to explore ways to facilitate the transition from United Nations peacekeeping radio stations to public service broadcasters From July 2009 to April 2010, approximately 190 candidates received technical clearance. As a result of the new human resources management reforms, the technical clearance requirement for recruitment is no longer relevant. However, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations worked closely with the Department of Public Information and the Department of Field Support to identify new candidate pools and develop public information rosters, including through participation in interview panels, as required Communications plan to increase the media engagement of heads of peacekeeping missions and other senior mission personnel during visits to United Nations Headquarters In collaboration with the Department of Public Information, a communications plan was developed to increase the media engagement of heads of peacekeeping missions and other senior mission personnel (such as press stakeouts following relevant Security Council briefings, as well as individual interviews with media organizations) In collaboration with the Department of Public Information and the Department of Field Support, conference of Chief Public Information Officers from all Department of Peacekeeping Operations missions, held at United Nations Headquarters, to build capacity and expertise in order to address changing public information challenges faced by all field missions The seventh annual conference of chief public information officers was held at the United Nations Logistics Base in Entebbe, Uganda in June 2010. The workshop was focused on support for the field, improved coordination with partners, such as the African Union, and ways to address existing and emerging challenges. This included the evaluation of strategic communications and priorities for the coming year, in particular an introduction to the support strategy of the Department of Field Support; as well as discussions on the new recruitment procedures and systems for field staff and the use of digital media. The conference also explored ways to facilitate the transition from peacekeeping radio stations to public service broadcasters Heads of mission conference organized A heads of mission conference was held in November 2009 in Switzerland Revised policy directives and associated implementation guidelines for Mission Joint Operations Centres/Joint Mission Analysis Centres Implementation policy and guidelines for Mission Joint Operations Centres/Joint Mission Analysis Centres were issued in February 2010. In addition, implementation visits were carried out to 5 peacekeeping missions (MONUC, UNAMID, UNMIL, UNMIS and UNOCI), and 3 follow-up working level visits were carried out, to UNAMID (2) and UNOCI Operations 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by the Situation Centre as the information hub for peacekeeping operations, monitoring and reporting on developments in Department of Peacekeeping Operations-led field missions and other areas of interest, including daily and ad hoc written reports and verbal briefings Operations were maintained 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Other emergencies/crises also occurred during the reporting period, requiring enhanced preparedness. These included the aircraft crash in Haiti, the Kalma camp crisis, the Kirumba attack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the elections in Afghanistan, the Kabul guesthouse attack and several hostage-takings in Darfur Monthly reports on topical issues affecting the current situation and/or possible development 9 monthly reports issued on Somalia and 16 thematic reports issued on other regions and situations, including the Lord's Resistance Army and the Democratic Republic of the Congo Weekly briefings to intergovernmental bodies with troop-contributing and police-contributing countries on the implementation of security policies jointly with the Department of Safety and Security While weekly briefings on developments in field operations were given to Member States and troop- and police-contributing countries, following the arrival of the Focal Point for Security in June 2009 and in the light of the fact that the implementation of security policy does not change on a weekly basis, it was determined that policy-related developments would be best communicated to Member States through normal interactions with intergovernmental bodies, such as the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, regarding specific security policy issues. Accordingly, the Special Committee was briefed on occupational safety (January 2010) and security force protection (February 2010). The Department of Peacekeeping Operations also provided inputs to the Special Committee on issues related to safety and security, including the area of security risk management-force protection, in March 2010 Bimonthly Inter-Agency Security Management Network meetings chaired by the Department of Safety and Security to share information on security issues, including personnel Plenary meetings of the Inter-Agency Security Management Network (August 2009, February 2010 and June 2010) and 2 meetings of the Network Steering Group (December 2009 and May 2010), with outputs comprising 26 separate policies and procedures reflecting inputs on the peacekeeping dimension of security and safety. Inputs on the peacekeeping dimension of security were included in all discussions of policies and procedures undertaken during weekly Network teleconferences. Lower output was due to the decision of the Network to hold 3 meetings during the reporting period (b) Office of Operations 45 multidimensional substantive reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council Reports, including those submitted under the 90-day reporting requirements with regard to Darfur and the unplanned reports requested by the Security Council 55 letters from the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council Letters.

This decision stemmed from the growing reliance of missions on Abacus visits, especially during the budget submission period, and attests to the Division's commitment to empower and strengthen capacity in field operations Financial management of 8 liquidating field operations (MONUA, UNAMSIL, ONUB, UNOTIL, UNIIIC, UNMIN, UNIOSIL and UNMEE), including the preparation and submission to the Accounts Division of monthly field financial statements, reconciling outstanding general ledger balances in field accounts and follow-up on recommendations of the Headquarters Property Survey Board Liquidating missions (MONUA, ONUB, UNAMSIL UNIIIC, UNIOSIL, UNMEE, UNOMIG and UNOTIL) UNMIN was not liquidated as had been proposed 2 results-based budgeting support visits to field operations to provide advice on frameworks for the budget and performance reports Results-based budgeting training and support visit to MINUSTAH Lower output due to reprioritization of operational and strategic activities. 5 results-based-budgeting workshops were conducted at Headquarters, with over 100 participants from departments and offices at Headquarters Provision of information technology support, including help desk, technical maintenance and functional guidance, to 44 field operations (including missions, tribunals and courts) on Sun/Progen field financial systems Field operations Negotiation and signing of 17 exchanges of letters between the Department of Field Support and the United Nations Volunteers Programme in Bonn to outline the framework of the services of the United Nations Volunteers deployed to peacekeeping operations and special political missions 13 exchanges of letters, including 2 amendments, were signed for 11 peacekeeping missions for 2009/10; 8 exchanges of letters, including 2 amendments, were signed for 6 special political missions. The 4 additional amendments to the exchanges of letters were due to extension of mandate, extension of hazard pay rates and deployment of additional United Nations Volunteers Regional visits to 5 peacekeeping missions by senior management to provide strategic advice on budget and financial issues Visits by the Officer-in-Charge (second review) Training courses on enterprise budgeting application for peacekeeping mission budget officers The implementation of the enterprise budgeting application has been discontinued in anticipation of the upcoming implementation of the enterprise resource planning system (c) Field Personnel Division Re-engineered and streamlined recruitment process in the context of the talent management framework The recruitment process for staffing field missions has been re-engineered to provide for pre-cleared, pre-vetted rosters of candidates who have been endorsed by a field central review body and who are ready for immediate selection by field missions Expert panels were held for 20 of the 24 occupational groups and yielded a roster of some 2,515 candidates whose candidacies have been endorsed by the field central review bodies Briefings to Member States on administrative and personnel issues relating to staffing of field missions Briefings to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Fifth Committee and the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations Direct support (including recruitment, travel and administration of contracts, salaries, allowances, benefit claims and entitlements) to approximately 7,000 international staff in 16 peacekeeping missions, 16 political missions and UNLB International staff as of 30 June 2010 to whom direct personnel support was provided. The total number of staff recruited and administered was 7,695 Personnel actions were processed during the reporting period (18,407 were processed at Headquarters and 19,859 in the field) Human resources policy guidance provided to approximately 7,000 international staff and 19,000 national staff serving in field operations through the human resources sections in the field International staff Locally recruited staff Lower output due to an approximation made for the planned outputs based on an authorized strength of 20,107 local positions. The actual number of local staff on board was less 16,985 on 30 June 2010 National Professional Officers United Nations Volunteers Human resources reforms relating to contractual arrangements and conditions of service in the field as approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 63/250, implemented in coordination with the Office of Human Resources Management New contractual arrangements and conditions of staff in non-family duty stations implemented effective July 2009. 3,620 internationally recruited mission staff reappointed from 300-series appointments of limited duration to fixed-term appointments under the new staff rules promulgated provisionally effective July 2009 Strengthened outreach programmes such as career and job fairs, targeted advertising in dedicated websites and professional publications and recruitment missions, to underrepresented countries in line with strategic workforce planning and analysis of data on internal and external candidates "Women in aviation" job fair, February 2010, Orlando, United States: more than 300 potential applicants showed an interest in employment within peacekeeping operations. 15 women (from Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin and North America) were found highly suitable in the areas of air operations, air safety, movement control and technical compliance. One met initial requirements for the D-1 level "International supply management" job fair, April 2010, San Diego, United States: more than 100 potential applicants showed an interest in employment within peacekeeping operations. 20 were found to meet the initial requirements in the areas of contract management, supply, procurement and logistics. Of these, 4 were women Outreach activities were undertaken in underrepresented countries, including Germany (April 2010), where meetings were held with approximately 50 potential candidates with expertise in the areas of logistics, procurement and engineering. Of these 50, approximately 10 applied for placement on the rosters. In relation to troop- and police-contributing countries, targeted outreach activities were undertaken in Egypt (November 2009) and Israel (December 2009, at the invitation of the Permanent Mission of Israel to the United Nations). Both visits reached out to 500 potential applicants across all substantive and some support areas of peacekeeping. Interested candidates were encouraged to apply for vacant posts through Galaxy During the reporting period, the number of non-governmental organization, university alumni and other professional associations to which outreach information is disseminated has grown to over 300 entities Rosters in 22 occupational groups relevant to peacekeeping operations There are 23 occupational groups (not including electoral) for which there are 516 rosters by functional title and grade level, per occupational group Of those 516 rosters, 301 have been processed by field central review bodies (i.e., occupational groups based on functional titles and grade level) and 215 have still not been filled through a field central review body/expert panel process Online career support for staff members in the field and through e-mail and delivery of direct career support training and consultation to 1,000 international staff members in 4 field missions (UNMIS, UNAMID, UNOCI and UNMIL) Support was prioritized to peacekeeping missions that were drawing down/downsizing (MINURCAT and UNOMIG), as well as to MINUSTAH, instead of to the four missions initially identified Phased implementation of a career development strategy, comprising online career-path models for selected occupational groups, to better meet the evolving needs of field operations Developing career-path models for support functions in field missions is an ongoing activity which is part of the talent management framework being designed together with the Office of Human Resources Management Succession planning and mechanism to ensure timely provision of shortlists to missions of high-quality candidates for Chief of Mission Support, Chief of Integrated Support Services/Chief of Technical Services, Chief Administrative Officer and Director of Mission Support positions The Succession Planning Panel selection process was reformed shortly after the establishment of the field central review bodies.

The Centre undertook cost-benefit analyses and made aircraft selections, with a view to reducing regional aviation operating costs and optimizing fleet utilization Flights centrally tracked, monitored and controlled Movements Provided timely, efficient and effective air terminal support for United Nations aviation activities at Brindisi Airport Identification of airfield infrastructure critical to peacekeeping operations which require an upgrade to local and international aviation standards In cooperation with ICAO under the signed management service agreement, requirements for rehabilitation and construction projects affecting air terminals, runways, tarmac, etcetera, were identified at MINURCAT, UNAMID and UNMIS. An additional assessment was undertaken in MINUSTAH following the earthquake Establishment of systems contracts for all types of equipment, inter-agency agreements and other systems contracts to provide specific responsive long-term support to major airfield infrastructure projects System contracts Most system contracts were due for renewal during the reporting period. The renewal process was undertaken in collaboration with the Procurement Division. The remaining 14 contracts are in the final stages of procurement and will be implemented by June 2011 Provision of guidance and recommendations on the development of and improvements to aviation infrastructure servicing field missions in accordance with ICAO standards A management service agreement between the United Nations and ICAO was signed and implemented. Agreements were reached with MINURCAT, UNMIS and UNAMID for the provision of technical expertise in rehabilitation and construction projects for airfield and air terminal improvement. Missions were provided with technical support services and expert guidance on rehabilitation and construction projects for airfield and air terminal improvement. Among those services were a techno-feasibility study and the preparation of a comprehensive aerodrome development master plan and a civil aviation development master plan Conduct of aviation safety assessment visits to peacekeeping missions to provide on-site guidance and technical assistance in their compliance with aviation safety standards, including accident prevention, risk analysis and accident investigation Aviation safety assessment visits (MINURCAT, MINURSO, MONUC, UNAMID, UNMIL, UNMIS, UNMIT and UNOCI) Review of peacekeeping mission support resource requirements and provision of advice and guidance on their formulation Reviewed the budget proposals of all peacekeeping missions for support resource requirement in coordination with the Field Budget and Finance Division. Comments, advice and guidance were provided when variations between the strategic guidance and the mission view of the resource requirements were identified Provision of tools, procedures and information-sharing forums for peacekeeping field missions to enhance the capability of missions to meet their requirements for equipment, commodities and services The road map application was piloted in 5 peacekeeping missions (MONUC, UNIFIL, UNMIL, UNMIS and UNOCI) and will be ready to launch to all missions by end of 2010 Developed new electronic reports to assist missions in identifying contingent performance and compliance with memorandums of understanding to assist in determining appropriate levels of equipment and self-sustainment capabilities and to help with data maintenance and administrative tasks related to contingent-owned equipment Contributed to initial steps in development by the Office of Information and Communications Technology of the new customer relationship management solution for contingent-owned equipment under the troop contributions management project Maintained and enhanced contingent-owned equipment reference library, web page and the Lotus Notes databases, including completion of updates following the 2008 contingent-owned equipment working group Developed, in consultation with UNLB, field missions and the Information and Communications Technology Division, the standard operating procedure for the monitoring of key performance indicators for property management to ensure the uniform and consistent monitoring of the departmental key performance indicators Maintained and enhanced the contingent-owned equipment and personnel management and support services community of practice, which provides access to a shared library of documents and web links useful for United Nations-owned equipment and contingent-owned equipment property management staff Redesigned the property threshold database as a web-based application that categorizes property to guide missions in tracking equipment as "non-expendable", "expendable" and "special items" Conduct of analysis and reviews of rations and fuel utilization, and monitoring of contract compliance The fuel management system was implemented in 2009/10 as a pilot in UNIFIL. The rations management system has not yet been procured, and is under solicitation. However, contract performance is monitored on a monthly basis through the analysis of rations reports and follow-up on issues and solutions with the relevant mission. The following major issues were identified and rectified in the reporting period: Wide variations in the rations ordering processes were detected across missions, resulting in inherent inefficiencies and potential wastage. The Logistics Support Division has begun to roll out a standardized rations ordering process, the recipe-card-based system that was developed in UNOCI. A related three-week workshop was completed in MONUC in June 2010. The rations-ordering system was implemented in UNOCI in June 2010 and in MONUC in August 2010, and will be implemented in UNDOF, UNFYCIP and UNIFIL by December 2010 and in UNAMID by March 2011 Inconsistent rations stock monitoring methodologies were applied across missions, resulting in incorrect reserve stock holdings in the reporting period. A new monitoring process has been implemented in UNAMID, UNMIL and UNOCI, and it will be implemented in MINUSTAH, MONUC, UNIFIL and UNMIS by April 2011. The process provides accurate information about reserve stocks of rations at the missions and will allow for reserve food levels to be verified in a transparent manner The Division undertook an analysis of the management of fuel operations through the quarterly fact sheet submitted by the missions, which provides information about the status of and updates on fuel contracts, consumption/requirements, equipment by category and type, prices, reserves, including strategic and local reserves, budgetary allocations and staffing Renewal of all logistics contracts managed at Headquarters that expire during the period Systems contracts were renewed in the reporting period Development and implementation of United Nations fuel quality assurance in fuel management for peacekeeping field missions Achieved through workshops, training and work processes. All materials are listed on the fuel management community of practice, the communication point with the missions. The community of practice provided information and guidance on fuel quality assurance through the fuel manual, best practices and other technical data. Reporting on implementation of quality assurance provides feedback from missions regarding specific issues arising out of practice (for example, the issue of allowable stock adjustment raised by MINUSTAH). The quarterly reports assisted with quality assurance by providing Headquarters with regular reports on key indicators of mission fuel operations. On the basis of the reports, Headquarters fuel staff recommend corrective action, counsel mission staff or promulgate a newly identified best practices Implementation of electronic fuel and rations management systems in 3 peacekeeping missions The rations management system required the resolicitation of the contract. The statement of work for the issuance of the request for proposal was submitted to the Procurement Division in March 2010. The Department of Field Support is currently waiting for the Procurement Division to take action to issue the request Fuel management system: the pilot/trial phase to test the software took place in UNIFIL. The process of procuring the hardware for the project is pending Development and promulgation of environmental objectives in line with the United Nations environmental policy and guidelines The Division is currently working with 50 United Nations entities through its participation in the Environment Management Group, in the context of the consultative process on environmental and social safeguards, and in the Issue Management Group, on sustainability management in the United Nations, which address the development of harmonized organization-wide environmental policies, including for field missions During the review of the liquidation manual, which has yet to be promulgated, consideration of the environment was included as an essential component of the liquidation process This output is expected to be delivered in 2010/11, as environmental considerations have been integrated into the strategic objectives and planning of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support Conduct of environmental impact studies and implementation of an environmental action plan to address the United Nations responsibility to consider the environmental impact of peacekeeping missions A technical report on the assessment of energy, water and waste reduction options for the proposed support for AMISOM headquarters camp in Mogadishu and the support base in Mombasa, Kenya (February 2010) was prepared jointly by the United Nations Environment Programme, the Department of Field Support and support for AMISOM The 2008 greenhouse gas emissions inventory for all peacekeeping operations was completed, representing 57 per cent of the total United Nations-wide footprint. Results were published in a report entitled "Moving towards a climate neutral United Nations: the United Nations system's footprint and efforts to reduce it" (2009). UNEP coordinated the effort to compile the 2008 greenhouse gas footprint of all United Nations organizations, with the respective organizations producing the inventory on the basis of a common methodology. The Information and Communications Technology Division provided the calculator for that process, and the Logistics Support Division created and reviewed a total of 66 files, customized for 30 field missions, in order to produce their respective greenhouse gas footprints Conducted a MONUC environmental awareness training course in Kinshasa in December 2009 Revision and promulgation of the catalogue for levels II, III and IV medical facilities in peacekeeping missions, including civilian medical facilities that are qualified to address Medevac and Casevac cases The review of the table of medical facilities (catalogue of medical facilities) was completed during the reporting period. The table provides information about the various levels of medical facilities available, and is a useful planning tool for medical support, in particular in the identification of available Casevac and Medevac facilities for field missions Review of the provision and management of medical services to field missions The draft of the guidelines for the management of drugs/pharmaceutical and medical consumables was completed Roll-out of bar-code technology applications in 5 field missions A systems contract was established in May 2010 for the provision of bar-code readers. The technology was piloted at UNLB. However, owing to delays in establishing the contract, the roll-out to 5 field missions has been postponed until the 2010/11 period. This will allow missions to purchase the equipment and receive necessary training. An implementation plan has been developed in coordination with the developers. Missions are purchasing the equipment from the systems contract Development of benchmarks in property management and introduction of the "best-in-class" business model on property management practices in all peacekeeping missions The Department of Field Support has established a property management framework and introduced a performance measurement system to monitor field mission activity. Every year, a workplan is issued which sets objectives, key actions, key performance indicators and targets in the discipline of property management. The key performance indicators are derived from an internal benchmarking exercise, which quantifies the operational performances of field missions in terms of equipment management and administration. Targets for each key performance indicator are based on the provisions of the United Nations Financial Regulations and Rules, the procedures described in the Property Management Manual, analysis by the Department of Field Support of property management trends and observations and recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the Board of Auditors concerning management practices and procedures for control and accountability of United Nations-owned equipment. The key performance indicators are a guide for field managers in making informed asset-management decisions A "best-in-class" performance management model was developed and implemented in Contingent-owned Equipment and Property Management Section and in all field missions. A best practices analysis has been conducted to characterize management practices and solutions that result in "best-in-class" performance. The "best-in-class" practices are shared among all stakeholders and documented through field mission standard operating procedures and guidelines, published in the property management community of practice Provision of regular advice, guidance and training of peacekeeping mission staff on the management of contingent-owned equipment Conducted contingent-owned equipment workshop at Headquarters (June 2010) for field- and Headquarters-based staff to further the development of contingent-owned equipment guidelines and the troop contribution management project for customer relationship management solutions, and to share information about policies on contingent-owned equipment and related developments Informed field staff about the audit observations of the Board of Auditors and issues arising from regular review of contingent-owned equipment verification reports Participated in the staff exchange programme, in which one staff member from the UNAMID Contingent-owned Equipment Section was temporarily assigned to Headquarters Provision of oversight and guidance to the development of contingent-owned equipment/memorandums of understanding management review boards in missions with a view to streamlining the determination of appropriate levels of equipment, personnel and self-sustainment capabilities of troop- and police-contributing Member States provided to field missions to ensure that they meet the operational requirements Support provided to UNOCI and UNMIT on the conduct of their contingent-owned equipment/ memorandum of understanding management review boards, including follow-up on policy issues pertaining to amendments to memorandums of understanding, and cost/payment implications of repatriation of equipment and review of eligibility/applicability of categories of self-sustainment Regular review of and follow-up to management review board minutes/reference material received from all other missions with such boards Visit to UNIFIL, with the Office of Information and Communications Technology, concerning the development of the new contingent-owned equipment database application and to assess the suitability of the mission to serve as pilot for the customer relationship management troop contribution management project and to review the contingent-owned equipment-related practices of the mission Visit to MONUC to review ongoing and future contingent-owned equipment and property management logistics-related needs Visit to UNAMID to assist in the establishment of the Property Management Section and the implementation of the property management workplan, including analysis of United Nations-owned equipment holdings against the key performance indicators set by the Department of Field Support for 2009/10, provide property management stakeholders with advice on United Nations-owned equipment management best practices, identify operational and functional tools to facilitate the establishment of property management functions, identify training requirements and establish a training-of-trainers programme on subjects presented during the workshop held in Entebbe (December 2009) Development and promulgation of standard operating procedure manuals, and refined resource requirements formulation procedures, including a Department of Field Support and Department of Peacekeeping Operations Guide to Strategic Movement, Field Movement Control Manual and revisions to the Surface Transport Manual and Department of Field Support Aviation Manual for the planning and coordination of transportation services The draft Surface Transport Manual was distributed to the field missions for review and comments following the Chief Transport Officer conference held at UNLB in April 2009. In this respect, the agreed timeline to provide comments was extended, owing to the need for subsequent consultations and clarifications, requested by the missions. Furthermore, during the final revision made by Headquarters staff members, important key points on policy matters were raised and a decision was taken to discuss those key points in the upcoming workshop, held at UNLB in October 2010.

The assessments were then reviewed at Headquarters 25 visits to peacekeeping missions in order to assess and provide advice on close protection arrangements Close protection assessments and advice were provided during combined visits undertaken by the Mission Support Unit. Resources were reprioritized to conduct an additional 3 strategic and operational security threat assessments 17 strategic threat assessments, 18 follow-up operational threat assessments and 17 individual threat assessments to support 17 field missions, UNLB and a secondary active telecommunications facility in Valencia, Spain Threat assessments for missions and Department of Field Support locations were conducted during security assistance visits. Three dedicated strategic assessment missions were also conducted at MONUC, UNIFIL and UNMIS Review of 34 mission threat assessments prepared by the peacekeeping missions Reviews conducted, including UNLB, the secondary active telecommunications facility at Valencia, and the logistics hub at Entebbe, Uganda DSS security information management course for a total of 20 security information analysts Courses conducted at the UNLB training facility in October 2009 and June 2010 and one at Headquarters in January 2010 Training of 1,240 security and safety personnel on security policies and procedures as they relate to the authority and functions of security officers; use of force; firearms -- qualification with tactical modifications according to mission threat level; defensive tactics, including spontaneous protection enabling defensive techniques, expandable baton, Ocoresin Capsicum spray and handcuffing techniques; fire safety; and hazardous materials, including equipment usage, accident prevention and evacuation procedures Security and safety personnel Firearms qualification/re-qualification training in UNIFIL (October to November 2009), UNMIL (June 2010) and UNMIT (April 2010); less lethal training (handcuffing, OC Spray and Batons) in UNIFIL (October to November 2009) and in UNMIT (April 2010); defensive tactics in UNIFIL (October to November 2009); fire safety training in UNMIL (June 2010) Lower output owing partly to fewer requests for training from the peacekeeping missions during the reporting period and partly due to the reprioritization of training programmes for instructors such as firearms, lethal weapons, and explosives to accommodate the unexpected security requirements of MINUSTAH in connection with the earthquake in Haiti (January 2010) K. Office of Information and Communications Technology Configured and customized Enterprise Information Portal for field mission substantive staff The portal software acquisition and the pilot implementation in MINUSTAH and UNSOA were postponed owing to additional time required for the development of the enterprise information portal prototype based on a selected software standard and the establishment of the network infrastructure at UNLB. In May 2010, began the requisition process for the acquisition of the enterprise information portal software and customization services, including a limited number of licences for the pilot implementation in 2010/11 and implementation in 8 field operations in 2011/12 Enterprise identity management system as an authoritative source of information on identity of personnel in field missions A pilot project was undertaken in May 2010 for the creation of the repository of field mission personnel, including data validation and quality assurance processes. This repository includes personnel data from four field operations (UNIFIL, UNMIL, MINUSTAH and UNLB). The enterprise identity management system field repository will be expanded for all peacekeeping operations and UNSOA in 2010/11 and will be gradually integrated with the Secretariat repository in 2011/12 This project is performed in collaboration with the Department of Field Support/Information and Communications Technology Division, who is responsible for collecting data from peacekeeping operations and for the Office of Information and Communications Technology to perform further analysis, validation, consolidation and integration in the main repository of United Nations personnel. Extensive reporting is also provided by enterprise identity management system to the Department of Field Support/Information and Communications Technology Division, for distribution to missions for data cleaning where applicable Fuel management system to facilitate the effective management of fuel usage in field missions The enterprise fuel management system, a commercial off-the-shelf solution, was acquired during the reporting period and pre-implementation study conducted at MINUSTAH in November 2009; however, due to the earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, the pilot implementation site was later changed to UNIFIL where a second pre-implementation study was conducted in March 2010. The change in site resulted in delays and the inability for the vendor to meet agreed deliverables The Office of Information and Communications Technology and the Department of Field Support acquired a limited number of fuel measuring hardware for testing the system software/hardware integration capability at UNIFIL in May-June 2010, including the installation of acquired fuel measuring devices. Based on the results of the field test, the vendor proceeded with software changes to meet the requirements of field operations. The final system acceptance test has been conducted in December 2010 at UNIFIL and UNLB Enterprise fuel management system software will be implemented in UNIFIL, UNDOF and UNSOA in 2010/11, in 4 peacekeeping operations in 2011/12 and remaining peacekeeping operations in 2012/13 Rations management system to facilitate the effective management of rations provision to formed military units in field missions As indicated in the 2008/09 performance report (A/64/611) the Organization initiated the acquisition of the commercial food control system however due to legal issues involving the previously selected vendor the procurement process was delayed and required the re-solicitation of the contract. In December 2009, the Procurement Division solicited the expression of interest from specialized vendors, resulting in nine expressions of interest. The statement of work for the issuance of the request for proposal was submitted to the Procurement Division in March 2010, for which the process remains pending. The pilot implementation will take place in 2011/12 in UNOCI and UNMIL, assuming no disruptions occur to procurement actions, and in selected field operations in 2011/12 and 2012/13 CA Clarity Portfolio Management system for the delivery of projects into the production information technology environment at UNLB The ePortfolio management system was implemented in production and is currently hosted at UNLB. The Office of Information and Communications Technology conducted training workshops for the ePortfolio management tool and portfolio management at MINURCAT, MINURSO, MONUC, UNOCI, UNAMID, UNFICYP, UNIFIL, UNMIT and UNLB The application portfolio management of the ePortfolio system was configured and a training workshop on the application portfolio management module was conducted for the focal points from MINURSO, MINUSTAH, MONUC, UNOCI, UNFICYP, UNIFIL, UNMIT and UNLB Enterprise content management technologies in support of peacekeeping reporting framework and doctrine and guidance repository projects Peacekeeping reporting process automation project This enterprise content management solution was initially planned for development, including the initial acquisition of operations reports repository software, however to avoid duplication of automated reporting solutions in the Organization, the Office of Information and Communications Technology cancelled the project to leverage the operations reports repository developed and implemented in production by the Information and Communications Technology Division/Department of Field Support. During the reporting period, the licences were acquired for a large number of users for the extension of the peacekeeping reporting process automation project, utilizing the operations reports repository application, to other types of mission reports, for which implementation has continued in the 2010/11 period Peacekeeping policy and guidance repository project A database for this enterprise content management solution was developed during the reporting period and will be implemented in production for 4 field operations (MINUSTAH, UNFICYP, UNMIT and UNSOA) in 2010/11 and in remaining field missions in 2011/12 Customer relationship management platform to provide automation solutions for the verification of capacity provided by troop-contributing countries in field missions Troop contribution management project The customer relationship management platform was configured at UNLB and software was acquired and customized during the reporting period for facilitating inspections of contingent-owned equipment in field operations during the reporting period. The initial implementation of this customer relationship management solution will be conducted at UNIFIL and UNOCI in 2010/11 and will continue to be deployed to peacekeeping operations with contingent-owned equipment in 2011/12 Peacekeeping telecommunications billing project The business analysis and feasibility study were performed and part of telecommunication services were implemented in the Department of Field Support at Headquarters, at UNLB in April 2010 and at UNIFIL in June 2010. This solution will continue to be implemented in additional peacekeeping operations and UNSOA in 2010/11 Customer relationship management solution for information and communications technology HelpDesk requests, from users in field missions, was implemented at UNLB in April 2010 and at UNIFIL in June 2010 4 visits to peacekeeping missions to provide on-site technical installation services and support for the Guidance Content Repository solution, the reporting process based on enterprise content management software, the troop-contributing countries' project and customer relationship management client software for telecommunications billing Visits Conducted one on-site visit to UNIFIL for the development of the customer relationship management solution for the troop contribution management project (inspection of contingent-owned equipment) Lower output overall due to the postponement of site visit until the planned development of enterprise content management and customer relationship management solutions is completed in 2010/11 Conducted two on-site technical installation service visits for the customer relationship management solution for information and communications technology HelpDesk requests at UNLB and UNIFIL 1 assessment of alignment between strategic programmes and the customer relationship management and enterprise content management enterprise information systems in UNIFIL, UNDOF, MONUC, UNAMID, UNMIS, UNMIL and UNOCI Assessment alignment between strategic programmes and the customer relationship management and enterprise content management enterprise information systems in UNIFIL and UNDOF The assessment was not undertaken in MONUC, UNAMID, UNMIS, UNMIL and UNOCI owing to incomplete design of the customer relationship management and enterprise content management solutions for field missions. The assessments will be undertaken when the design is complete in 2010/11 1 assessment of interoperability and implementation of integration between 2 applications based on customer relationship management and enterprise content management technologies in field mission setting, specifically in UNIFIL, UNDOF and UNFICYP Assessment visit of interoperability between strategic programmes and the customer relationship management and enterprise content management enterprise information systems in UNIFIL and UNDOF The assessment was not undertaken in UNFICYP owing to incomplete design of the customer relationship management and enterprise content management solutions for field missions.
