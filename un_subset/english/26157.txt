By a letter dated 11 October 2004, a certified copy of which was forwarded to the attention of the Secretary-General under the cover of a letter dated 11 October 2004 from the President of the International Court of Justice, Judge and former President Gilbert Guillaume informed the President of the Court, pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 4, of the Statute of the Court, of his resignation as a member of the Court effective 11 February 2005.
