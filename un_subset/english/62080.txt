General Assembly Sixty-seventh session Agenda item 34 Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and development Security Council Sixty-seventh year Identical letters dated 21 September 2012 from the Permanent Representative of Georgia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council I have the honour to transmit herewith a statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia dated 21 September 2012, in reaction to the concentration of the armed forces of the Russian Federation near the administrative borders of Georgia's occupied provinces (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and the annex thereto issued as a document of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 34, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Alexander Lomaia Permanent Representative Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia in reaction to the concentration of the armed forces of the Russian Federation near the administrative borders of Georgia's occupied provinces In recent weeks, the armed forces of the Russian Federation have been concentrating manpower and offensive equipment in the areas adjacent to the administrative borders of Georgia's occupied provinces, which increases the risk of dangerous provocation. This was confirmed today, as a helicopter of the Russian military made landing in the area controlled by the central Georgian authorities, in proximity to the Tskhinvali region. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs voices stark protest in relation to this incident and calls on the Russian Federation to desist from amassing manpower and military assets in the occupied regions. As the Ministry has stated earlier, the large-scale military manoeuvres of the Russian Armed Forces, "Kavkaz-2012", have been purposely rescheduled to coincide with the pre-election period in Georgia. Our concerns about subsequent risks and provocations have also proved valid. The Foreign Ministry will urgently inform the relevant international organizations and Georgia's partners regarding the recent actions of the Russian occupation forces, so that they convey to official Moscow that this aggressive posture is unacceptable.
