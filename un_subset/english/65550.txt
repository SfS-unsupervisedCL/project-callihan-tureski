Letter dated 25 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council Further to my meeting with you yesterday, I would like to convey to you that the Yarmouk military factory in the capital of my country, Khartoum, which produces traditional weapons and ammunition, was subjected to aerial bombardment by the Israeli Air Force in the early hours of Wednesday, 24 October. The bombardment led to the death of two civilians and seriously injured a third person. The Government of the Sudan condemns in the strongest possible words this barbaric aggression, which stands as a stark violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the sovereignty of the Sudan. While conveying to you this heinous act of aggression against my country, we will also keep you informed about the result of the National Committee of Investigation on the matter and would expect the Security Council to take appropriate measures accordingly. You are kindly requested to circulate the present letter as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman Permanent Representative
