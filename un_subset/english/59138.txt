Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, in particular annex III to the report, entitled "International cooperation to reduce the impact of the El Niño phenomenon", and calls upon the international community to make further efforts to assist countries affected by this phenomenon; 2. Recognizes the efforts made by the Governments of Ecuador and Spain, the World Meteorological Organization and the inter-agency secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction to support the International Research Centre on El Niño at Guayaquil, Ecuador, and encourages them and other members of the international community to continue such contributions for the advancement of the Centre; 3. Welcomes the activities undertaken so far to strengthen the International Research Centre on El Niño, through collaboration with international monitoring centres, including the national oceanographic institutions, and efforts to enhance regional and international recognition of and support for the Centre and to develop tools for decision makers and Government authorities for reducing the impact of the El Niño phenomenon; 4. Notes the contribution of the International Research Centre on El Niño as a reference centre on climate services and climate-related disaster risk reduction, as well as in the area of climate research, including through the development of a new climatic database for El Niño/Southern Oscillation-sensitive countries, and encourages the sharing of best practices with climate centres located in other El Niño-affected regions; 5. Recognizes the technical and scientific support of the World Meteorological Organization in producing regionally coordinated monthly and seasonal forecasts, in particular its establishment of a consensus mechanism for the development of updates on El Niño/La Niña conditions, which receives contributions from several climate centres, including the International Research Centre on El Niño; 6. Encourages, in this regard, the World Meteorological Organization to continue to strengthen collaboration and the exchange of data and information with relevant institutions; 7. Calls upon the Secretary-General, the relevant United Nations organs, funds and programmes, in particular those taking part in the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and the international community to adopt, as appropriate, the measures necessary to further strengthen the International Research Centre on El Niño, and invites the international community to provide scientific, technical and financial assistance and cooperation for this purpose, as well as to strengthen, as appropriate, other centres devoted to the study of the El Niño phenomenon; 8. Underlines the importance of maintaining the El Niño/Southern Oscillation observation system, continuing research into extreme weather events, improving forecasting skills and developing appropriate policies for reducing the impact of the El Niño phenomenon and other extreme weather events, and emphasizes the need to further develop and strengthen these institutional capacities in all countries, in particular developing countries; 9. Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session on the implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction a section on the implementation of the present resolution. 69th plenary meeting 20 December 2010
