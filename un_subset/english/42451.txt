Ninth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names New York, 21-30 August 2007 Item 9 (c) of the provisional agenda* National standardization: treatment of names in multilingual areas Louis Trichardt/Makhado: town "name change" Submitted by South Africa** During 2003, the Minister of Arts and Culture approved the change of the name "Louis Trichardt" to "Makhado", on the recommendation of the South African Geographical Names Council, after the Makhado municipality had applied for the name change. The Chairpersons Association launched an application in the High Court of Pretoria to challenge the legality of the Minister's decision on the name change, requesting that the High Court review and set aside the decision of the Minister on the grounds that insufficient consultations had been undertaken by the municipality. The High Court ruled in favour of the Minister of Arts and Culture and of the South African Geographical Names Council. The matter was then taken to Appeal Court by the Chairpersons Association and the Court ruled in favour of the complainant. Consequently, the name of the town is "Louis Trichardt", as per the decision of the Appeal Court.
