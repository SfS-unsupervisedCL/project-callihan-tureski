UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1998/547 22 June 1998 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: ARABIC IDENTICAL LETTERS DATED 20 JUNE 1998 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL AND TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to inform you that violations of Iraq's airspace by United States aircraft continued between 1 and 15 June 1998 and that the aircraft in question carried out reconnaissance and engaged in acts of provocation, as set forth in the annex hereto. Your intervention is requested with a view to bringing a halt to actions that, as flagrant violations of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law, pose a threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Iraq. These actions continue to alarm the civilian population and to cause serious damage to private and public property. The Republic of Iraq affirms its right to seek legal compensation for the damage being inflicted on the Iraqi people and the Iraqi State by these actions. I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council.
