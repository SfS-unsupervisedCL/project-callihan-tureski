The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in section V of the present report. 1. The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009, as set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 17 March 2008 (A/62/751), amounted to $688,813,300 gross ($677,077,300 net). It provided for 15,000 military contingent personnel, 415 international staff (including 7 temporary positions) and 842 national staff. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in paragraph 43 of its related report on the budget of UNIFIL (62/781/Add.5), recommended that the General Assembly appropriate $668,370,300 gross for the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. 2. The General Assembly, by its resolution 62/265, appropriated the amount of $650,755,600 gross ($639,711,800 net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance A. Overall 3. The mandate of UNIFIL was established by the Security Council in its resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978), expanded in its resolution 1701 (2006) and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions. The mandate for the performance period was provided by the Council in its resolutions 1773 (2007) and 1832 (2008). 4. The Force is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to restore international peace and security in southern Lebanon. 5. Within this overall objective, the Force has, during the performance report period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below. These frameworks are grouped by components, namely, operations and support. 6. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based budgeting frameworks set out in the 2008/09 budget. In particular, the performance report compares the actual indicators of achievement that is, the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement and the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs. B. Budget implementation 7. During the reporting period, UNIFIL continued its regular operational activities of monitoring the cessation of hostilities and assisting the Lebanese Armed Forces in maintaining its area of operations free of unauthorized armed personnel, assets and weapons, other than its own and those of UNIFIL, through its regular patrolling activities and efforts to prevent violations of the Blue Line, and of working closely in coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces. At the same time, the Maritime Task Force continued to patrol and conduct maritime interdiction operations in the UNIFIL area of maritime operations. In undertaking its mandated operational activities, the Force continued to strengthen its cooperation and coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces and maintained a high level of liaison and coordination with both the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israeli Defense Forces, with a view to maintaining the cessation of hostilities and preventing violations of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). 8. The Force continued to enhance and expand cooperation and coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces, including through regular training activities, with both ground and maritime components. UNIFIL also continued to facilitate and lead a tripartite mechanism with representatives from the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israeli Defense Forces. By carrying out its mandate as stipulated in Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), UNIFIL, in cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces, is building on current achievements in stabilizing the area of operations. UNIFIL continued regular operational activities to prevent violations of the Blue Line by visibly marking the Blue Line, commencing the construction of a Blue Line road and ensuring that the area south of the Litani River was free of any unauthorized armed personnel, assets and weapons. 9. The extent of the expansion of the existing Force headquarters was not originally envisaged during the formulation of the 2008/09 budget. The decision to expand the Force headquarters over a larger area resulted from a security assessment of the situation of United Nations personnel and property, which are concentrated in a small area. The Force is currently expanding the headquarters in Naqoura using 1.2 million square metres of land southeast of the existing headquarters that has been provided by the host Government. In 2008/09, UNIFIL initiated the implementation of several major engineering projects, including the construction of concrete water tanks, solid ablution units, warehouses and workshops for generators, transport and supplies, storage facilities for transport and engineering, a helipad, the construction of a concrete building for the Communications and Information and Technology Section and the construction of minor roadways and pathways. Planned projects in the new site should be completed by June 2010. The Force also initiated essential road works along the Blue Line in coordination with the Lebanese Armed Forces. 10. The parties continued to be fully committed to the Force's mandated tasks in the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). Tension along the Blue Line increased substantially as a result of the rocket attacks during the hostilities in Gaza, stretching the operational capacity of the military component of UNIFIL to the limit but without causing a significant impact on budget implementation. The main factor that affected budget implementation was the lower average deployment of military contingent personnel and the lower number of vessels deployed in the Maritime Task Force. C. Regional mission cooperation 11. UNIFIL continued to maintain close cooperation with other United Nations peacekeeping operations in the region. The United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) provided stand-by capacity in case of the evacuation of UNIFIL staff to Cyprus. UNIFIL continued to provide logistic and administrative support to the Observer Group Lebanon of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) on the provision of support for infrastructure, office accommodation, information and communications technology equipment and related maintenance services, medical support, fuel and spare parts for vehicles, emergency rations and water and security. In addition, UNIFIL maintained close cooperation with the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) on the sharing of regional information on economic and social development, including cost-of-living surveys, and the use of its training facilities. Procurement support was provided to the International Independent Investigation Commission until its closure during the reporting period. 12. Based on the availability of UNIFIL resources, the Force also provided administrative, logistical and technical support to the office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, which, inter alia, coordinated the work of all United Nations agencies in Lebanon. The Security Information Operations Centre of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Beirut continued to provide security information for all United Nations staff operating and/or living in Lebanon, north of the Litani River and maintained responsibility for security clearances of UNIFIL staff travelling to Beirut. With regard to regional cooperation in the area of training, civilian staff from peacekeeping operations and other United Nations offices in the region (UNFICYP, the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), UNTSO, the International Independent Investigation Commission, the office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, ESCWA, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)) continued to participate in training programmes provided by UNIFIL, including HIV/AIDS training. UNIFIL also continued to assist and coordinate activities with UNDOF on transport maintenance works. In relation to travel, UNIFIL participated with other United Nations agencies (the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon) in the UNDP-led global tender for travel services. D. Mission support initiatives 13. UNIFIL contributed to the Senior Mission Administration and Resource Training Programme by coordinating the development of modules on acquisition, property management and disposal, mission start-up, medical, ground and air transportation, movement control, information and communications technology and engineering. UNIFIL implemented its human resource action plan during the reporting period to enhance its capacity in that field. 14. As part of the development of the United Nations overall risk management strategy, UNIFIL continued to develop and refine its own business continuity planning in order to reduce operational risk and enhance crisis management and disaster recovery planning. E. Results-based-budgeting frameworks Component 1: operations 15. The operations component encompassed the continuation of operational activities to prevent violations of the Blue Line, prevention of the resumption of hostilities and the establishment of an area that is free of unauthorized armed personnel, assets and weapons, in cooperation with the Lebanese Armed Forces. During the 2008/09 period, the Maritime Task Force continued to patrol and conduct maritime interdiction operations. In addition, the Force intensified its cooperation and coordination on operational activities with the Lebanese Armed Forces, including an increase in both joint exercises and training. UNIFIL also continued to lead and facilitate a tripartite mechanism with representatives of the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israeli Defense Forces. Expected accomplishment 1.1: stable and secure environment in southern Lebanon Planned indicators of achievement Actual indicators of achievement Absence of air, sea or ground incursions or firing incidents across the Blue Line 2,995 air violations, 14 sea violations and 18 minor ground violations of the Blue Line recorded by UNIFIL; 3 rockets and artillery-firing incidents across the Blue Line; 1 firing incident across the Blue Line; the Israeli Defense Forces continued to maintain a presence in the northern part of Ghajar village (north of the Blue Line) Lebanese Armed Forces deployed throughout the entire area south of the Litani River, including Ghajar village The Lebanese Armed Forces, which was being restructured from 4 brigades to 2 heavy and one light brigades at almost the same overall strength, remained deployed throughout the UNIFIL area of operations, with the exception of the northern area of the village of Ghajar. The Lebanese Armed Forces operated an average of 112 checkpoints and observation posts a day as well as a total of 50 patrols a day Area between the Litani River and the Blue Line is free of armed personnel, weapons and related materiel, except for those of the Lebanese Armed Forces and UNIFIL 3 incidents of rocket launches perpetrated by armed elements from the UNIFIL area of operations; one instance of rockets set up to be launched. On two occasions, UNIFIL located rockets and associated materiel and found infrastructure in the area of operations, but found no evidence of their use after 14 August 2006 Participation by both parties in meetings of the Tripartite Coordination Group and maintenance of liaison and coordination arrangements Achieved: 9 meetings of the Tripartite Coordination Group held during the reporting period Planned outputs Completed (number or yes/no) Remarks 1,314,000 mobile patrol person days (10 troops x 360 patrols x 365 days) Mobile patrol person days (average of 10 troops x 361 patrols x 365 days) 109,500 mobile patrol person days as an initial reserve capacity, and a quick reaction capacity for the reconnaissance of areas of tension, reconnoitring and intervention, if required, in crisis situations to support other units (10 troops x 30 patrols x 365 days) Mobile patrol person days (on average, 10 troops per patrol x 41 patrols per day x 365 days) The higher output resulted from the dynamic operational environment and fragile security situation 536,550 manned observation post person days (7 troops per post x 3 shifts per post x 70 posts x 365 days) Manned observation post person days (on average, 7 troops per post x 3 shifts per post x 83 posts x 365 days) The higher output was due to the fragile security situation, which resulted in an increased number of manned observation posts, both fixed and random/temporary posts on a daily basis, for continuous monitoring of the area of operations 540 air patrol hours along the Blue Line Air patrol hours The higher output was due to the increased frequency of air patrols to daily patrols, owing to the requirement for increased reconnaissance of the area of operations with particular focus on the Blue Line 1,680 flight hours for investigation of incidents and operational movements for transport of combat assets, reconnaissance, command and control function, and liaison Flight hours The higher output was due to increased requirements for the movement of UNIFIL military personnel, by helicopter, in the area of operation as well as to investigation teams travelling by helicopter 2,555 naval vessel patrol days to monitor the maritime border of Lebanon, including joint operational exercises with the Lebanese Armed Forces (average of 4 frigates x 365 days; average of 3 patrol vessels x 365 days) Naval vessel patrol days in the area of maritime operations (average of 3 frigates x 365 days; average of 3 patrol vessels x 365 days) The lower output resulted from the reduced number of vessels in the Maritime Task Force and from poor weather conditions that necessitated the return to port of smaller vessels 2,920 flight hours for maritime interdiction patrols and operational activities inside the area of maritime operations The lower output was attributable to the deployment of 5 helicopters instead of 7 in the Maritime Task Force 3 reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council Reports In addition: Letter of the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council Weekly meetings with senior Lebanese security officials on security issues and their impact on the local population in southern Lebanon Yes Weekly meetings Liaison, communication and exchange of information with both parties, as and when required, on issues requiring immediate attention relating to the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), in support of conflict resolution and public information activities Regular meetings and contacts with both sides on a bilateral level, as well as during meetings of the Tripartite Coordination Group and weekly meetings with the Israeli Defense Forces and the Lebanese Armed Forces Conduct of 15 joint exercises, seminars and training courses with the Lebanese Armed Forces to improve the tactical and operational capabilities of the Lebanese Armed Forces and the coordination between UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces at operational and tactical levels for enhanced effectiveness of combined operations Joint exercises, comprising 8 exercises at the operational level, 4 exercises at the sector level and 3 training sessions on conflict management Joint lectures between UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Force on exchange of information, sharing of expertise on various topics and confidence-building to enhance understanding between the two military forces Civilian and military coordination courses on civilian-military cooperation and community outreach Civilian and military coordination seminar on civilian-military cooperation and community outreach Maritime Task Force workshops on the theoretical background to the tactical, boarding, damage control and search and rescue exercises carried out by the Lebanese Armed Forces with the Maritime Task Force Tactical exercises Boarding exercises Damage control exercises Search and rescue exercises Provision, on a monthly basis, of secretariat support services for the meetings of the Tripartite Coordination Group For 9 meetings of the Tripartite Coordination Group Weekly liaison and coordination meetings with local authorities/community representatives and civic associations/ partner organizations on assistance in conflict resolution and confidence-building initiatives, and on progress towards stability at the local level Regular high-level meetings with senior Lebanese officials and local authorities, including: (a) an average of 10 to 12 meetings per week with mayors in each of the two sectors on the general situation in their municipalities and their relationship with UNIFIL;

Support was provided to an average strength of 12,422 military contingents, to civilian staffing of 323 international (including temporary positions) and to 656 national staff. The range of support comprised all support services, including the implementation of conduct and discipline and HIV/AIDS programmes, budget and finance, personnel administration, training, contract management, health care, maintenance and construction of office and accommodation facilities, information technology and communications, air and naval operations, surface transport operations and supply and resupply operations, as well as the provision of security services Force-wide. Expected accomplishment 2.1: effective and efficient logistical, administrative and security support to the Force Reduction in the number of servers in use by 18 per cent by June 2009 through server virtualization technology (2007/08: 83; 2008/09: 68) Reduction of 13 per cent in the number of servers in use to 72 servers through the expansion of the server virtualization project; owing to the fact that UNIFIL was used as a pilot mission for the implementation of the virtualization project, the reduction in the number of servers was lower than planned as a result of time-consuming trial runs Increase in bandwidth to implement anticipated centralized information technology systems (2007/08: 3 MB; 2008/09: 8 MB) Achieved. Increase in bandwidth to 20 MB to support centralized information technology systems, as a result of access to competitive regional markets through the Middle East regional communications and information technology network integration that enabled shared services for UNDOF, UNFICYP, UNTSO and UNIFIL Service improvements Implementation of virtualization technology for more efficient utilization of servers 80 per cent of virtualization project completed by June 2009 Implementation of the upgrade of the bandwidth from 3 MB in 2007/08 to 8 MB in 2008/09 Increase in bandwidth to 20 MB Military, police and civilian personnel Emplacement, rotation and repatriation of an average of 15,000 military contingent personnel Military contingent personnel (average strength) Verification, monitoring and inspection of contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment for an average of 15,000 military personnel For 43 military units Storage and supply of 11,738 tons of rations, 187,000 combat rations and 1,260,900 litres of bottled water for military contingent personnel in 20 locations (warehouses and distribution points) Tons of rations Combat rations/composite ration packs The lower output was due to the fact that the average troop strength was lower than planned. No bottled water was purchased owing to the availability of bottled water with a shelf life of 24 months from the previous period Locations The higher number of locations was based on operational requirements Administration of 1,253 civilian staff, comprising 411 international staff (excluding the Strategic Military Cell) and 842 national staff, including temporary positions International staff (average strength) National staff (average strength) Temporary positions (average strength) The lower number of international and national staff was attributable to adjustments made to the deployment of support personnel, owing to the lower average deployment of military personnel Implementation of a conduct and discipline programme for all military and civilian personnel, including training, prevention, monitoring and recommendations on remedial action where misconduct has occurred 8,775 personnel trained: through induction training on conduct and discipline for 556 UNIFIL personnel (388 military personnel, 47 international staff and 121 national staff); briefings on United Nations standards of conduct for 186 UNIFIL personnel (112 military personnel and 74 national staff); pilot training on sexual harassment for 75 military personnel; and training-of-trainers courses for 234 military personnel Cases: the Regional Conduct and Discipline Team reviewed and

and infrastructure Storage supply of 1,720,000 litres of petrol, oil and lubricants for generators per month Litres of fuel The lower output is owing to delays in the deployment of planned power plants and delays in the establishment of new camps in the mission area Maintenance and renovation of storage facilities for fuel and lubricants for generators, vehicles, air and naval transportation in 100 locations The higher number is due to the implementation of the new "turn-key" fuel contract that covered 78 direct-delivery sites and 9 retail distribution points Maintenance and repair of 63 military positions comprising 2,050 prefabricated buildings and 153 hardwall buildings Military positions Prefabricated buildings The lower number was attributable to the write-off of a higher number of prefabricated buildings than planned, owing to the physical condition of the buildings Hardwall buildings Repair and maintenance of helipads at 21 locations Helipads in 21 locations Operation and maintenance of 11 United Nations-owned water purification plants in 8 locations United Nations-owned water purification plants Locations, including one plant recommissioned to UNIFIL House in Beirut Operation, maintenance and repair of 263 United Nations-owned generators United Nations-owned generators The lower number is due to the replacement of smaller generators with higher-capacity generators, owing to the higher demand for power for security and communications purposes Provision of water supply for general use for an average strength of 15,000 military contingent personnel For an average strength of 12,422 personnel Sewage collection and disposal from 63 military positions For 63 military positions Ground transportation Operation and maintenance of 919 United Nations-owned vehicles, including 76 armoured military pattern vehicles and 20 armoured civilian pattern vehicles in 9 workshops in 6 locations United Nations-owned vehicles, including 99 armoured vehicles (45 military pattern and 54 civilian pattern) in 9 workshops in 6 locations The higher number is due to the acquisition of additional vehicles, including 80 light vehicles and 25 vehicle attachments, and the inclusion of vehicles that were being written off Supply and storage of 7.6 million litres of fuel and lubricants for ground transportation Million litres The higher output is due to the operation of a larger vehicle fleet, including a higher than planned number of contingent-owned vehicles, and requirements for fuel reserve Operation of a daily shuttle service (5 days a week) for an average of 36 United Nations personnel per day from a designated location near their place of residence to the Force headquarters For 5 days a week for an average of 24 United Nations personnel Provision of training workshops for 700 drivers/operators for all types of vehicles Drivers/operators for all types of vehicles The higher number is due to the increased rotation of military personnel and requirements for additional driver training for civilian personnel Air transportation Operation and maintenance of 9 rotary-wing aircraft, comprising 8 military aircraft and 1 commercial aircraft Rotary-wing aircraft Military aircraft Commercial aircraft The additional commercial, rotary-wing aircraft (Mi-8MTV) was required to cover limitations of 2 Bell helicopters (replacing 2 Super Puma helicopters) on flights over water Supply of 1.1 million litres of aviation fuel Million litres: the higher output is due to the deployment of an additional rotary-wing aircraft for additional reconnaissance flights conducted along the Blue Line owing to war/crisis in Gaza Communications Support and maintenance of a satellite network consisting of 2 Earth station hubs for voice, fax, video and data communications Earth station hubs Support and maintenance of 7 very small aperture terminal (VSAT) systems, 35 telephone exchanges and 125 microwave links VSAT systems The higher number is due to an inadvertent error in the formulation of the planned output, which should have reflected 10 VSAT systems Telephone exchanges The higher number is due to the additional requirements to support troops deployed in the area of operations Microwave links The higher number is due to the implementation of redundant ring protection to increase the reliability of the microwave network backbone resulting from the increase in the number of microwave links Support and maintenance of 80 high frequency (HF), 2,994 very-high frequency (VHF) and 26 ultra-high frequency (UHF) rural telephone links High frequency radios The lower number is due to the write-off of 2 HF telephone links VHF radios The higher number resulted from the implementation of a secured VHF command network based on military tactical operational requirements UHF rural telephone links The higher number resulted from additional redundant enhancing installations in positions on the Blue Line and the inclusion of items of equipment that were scheduled for write-off action Support of production of videos and magazines on the Force's activities and maintenance of broadcasting and publishing equipment Episodes of a television series, "Discover UNIFIL" produced Issues of Al Janoub magazine published Information technology Support and maintenance of 68 servers, 1,627 desktop computers, 336 laptop computers, 432 printers, 135 digital senders in 29 locations Servers, comprising 72 in use, 9 in stock and 19 pending completion of write-off action Desktop computers Laptop computers Printers Digital senders The higher number of items of information technology equipment resulted from additional military operational requirements for secure data network, the expansion of the Force headquarters, the establishment of the Movement Control Office in Beirut airport and delays in the completion of write-off actions Locations: the higher number of locations is due to the establishment of two positions on the Litani River which were deemed of high-security priority, the Movement Control Office in Beirut Airport and the new extension to UNIFIL headquarters in Naquora Support and maintenance of 30 local area networks (LAN), wide area networks (WAN) and wireless area network for an average of 1,600 users, including UNIFIL House in Beirut LAN, WAN and wireless area networks for an average of 2,300 users The higher number resulted from the deployment of 3 new military contingent units in the area of operations that were not foreseen at the time of the budget preparation Implementation of the application acceleration system to improve performance of centrally delivered web-enabled applications Performance and access to WE-enabled applications have improved following the installation of

Monthly expenditure pattern 17. Higher expenditures in September 2008, January and May 2009 were primarily attributable to obligations related to the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for troop costs, contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment. C. Other income and adjustments (Thousands of United States dollars) Interest income Other/miscellaneous income Voluntary contributions in cash Prior-period adjustments Cancellation of prior-period obligations Total D.

The unspent balance was mainly attributable to the delayed deployment of military contingent personnel (average vacancy rate of 17 per cent against the authorized delayed deployment factor of 8 per cent), resulting in reduced requirements for troop costs and contingent-owned equipment, death and disability and rations. The unspent balance was partly offset by: (a) additional requirements related to the settlement of outstanding charges for logistic support related to the expansion of the Force in the 2006/07 period; (b) the settlement of charges related to the rotation of one contingent in the prior financial period; and (c) the additional requirements for freight charges related to the repatriation of two contingents and the deployment of three contingents during the reporting period. 19. The additional requirements were mainly attributable to increased common staff costs, which were offset in part by the higher actual vacancy rate of 22 per cent, compared with the budgeted vacancy factor of 14 per cent. 20. The unutilized balance resulted primarily from the higher average vacancy rate of 44 per cent for National Officers and the higher average vacancy rate of 21 per cent for national General Service staff, compared with the budgeted vacancy factor of 15 per cent for both categories, owing to the management decision to adjust the deployment of national civilian staff, taking into account the lower average deployment of military personnel. 21. The unspent balance was mainly attributable to reduced requirements for hazardous duty station allowance during absences from the area of operation and the reduction in the occupational recuperation break from 12 to 8 weeks. 22. The unspent balance was mainly due to the fact that the services of three police consultants for border control and customs issues were not requested by the Government of Lebanon. 23. The unutilized balance resulted from the increased reliance on in-house resources for the conduct of training programmes. 24. The variance resulted primarily from additional requirements for construction services related to the expansion of the Force headquarters. The variance was partly offset by reduced requirements for: (a) maintenance services owing to lower monthly rates for garbage disposal; (b) alteration and renovation services owing to the cancellation of a number of projects following the expansion of the Force headquarters; (c) spare parts and supplies owing to delays in the updating of the notto exceed amount on the systems contract; (d) reduced requirements for petrol, oil and lubricants (actual 1.55 million litres per month at an average cost of $0.66 per litre compared with the budgeted 1.7 million litres per month at $0.64 per litre); and (e) reduced requirements for self-sustainment owing to the lower average deployment of contingent personnel. 25. The variance was primarily attributable to reduced requirements for the acquisition of vehicles, resulting from the cancellation of the acquisition of 4 items of engineering equipment, 4 trucks and 1 heavy forklift that were not considered required as originally envisaged, based on a review of the Force's vehicle requirements. 26. The additional requirements were primarily attributable to the replacement of 4 single-engine helicopters by 4 twin-engine helicopters, the replacement of 2 commercial aircraft with 2 Bell single-engine helicopters and an additional MI8MTV helicopter, in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards and to enhance UNIFIL's capacity for flights over water, which resulted in the increase of flying hours to 2,646 hours against the budgeted 2,040 hours. 27. The unutilized balance was primarily attributable to the lower average deployment of vessels deployed in the Maritime Task Force as follows: (a) actual average of 4 frigates and 5 patrol boats deployed for an average of 21 days per month compared with the budgeted plan for 6 frigates and 5 patrol boats for 30 days per month; (b) actual deployment of 6 months for the combat ship for an average of 27 days per month compared with assumption of its deployment for the full 12month period; and (c) average of 5 maritime helicopters for an average of 14 flying hours per month compared with the planned 7 maritime helicopters for an average of 30 flying hours per month. 28. The unutilized balance was mainly attributable to: (a) reduced requirements for reimbursements to troop-contributing Governments for self-sustainment, resulting from the cancellation of the planned deployment of some military units, the late deployment of some contingent and the earlier repatriation of some contingents; (b) reduced requirements for commercial communications, resulting from more favourable terms in communications contracts completed at Headquarters and from lower actual costs for internet and satellite services; and (c) reduced requirements for the acquisition of equipment, resulting from the acquisition of a lower number of ECM (jammers) equipment (actual of 29 jammers compared with 32 jammers planned) at a lower unit cost (actual cost of $82,870 per jammer compared with the budgeted cost of $135,000 per jammer). The unspent balance was partly offset by additional requirements for spare parts for the ECM (jammers) equipment and for solar panels. 29. The unspent balance was primarily attributable to: (a) reduced requirements for spare parts for servers, resulting from the reduction in the number of servers arising from the implementation of the server virtualization technology; and (b) reduced requirements for software licenses, resulting from economies of scale achieved from high-volume purchases at Headquarters. 30. The unspent balance was mainly attributable to: (a) reduced requirements for reimbursements to troop-contributing Governments for self-sustainment, owing to the cancellation, late deployment or early repatriation of some contingents; (b) reduced requirements for medical supplies, owing to the lower average deployment of military contingent personnel; and (c) reduced requirements for medical services, resulting from the lower average deployment of military and civilian personnel and the recording of expenditures on medical repatriations of military personnel under the budget class for military contingents. 31. The unspent balance was mainly attributable to reduced requirements for reimbursements to troop-contributing Governments for self-sustainment, resulting from the cancellation, late deployment or early repatriation of military contingent units. 32. The unutilized balance was primarily attributable to: (a) reduced requirements for uniforms, flags and decals, owing to the lower average deployment of military contingent personnel; (b) reduced requirements for freight and related costs, resulting from a lower volume of shipments of United Nations-owned equipment; and (c) reduced requirements for other rations, resulting from the adequacy of existing stock for which the expiration dates spanned beyond the reporting period. The balance was partly offset by additional requirements for training fees and supplies, resulting from the use of in-house resources for the training of a higher number of participants in the mission area. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 33. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNIFIL are to decide on the treatment of: (a) The unencumbered balance of $75,219,400 with respect to the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009; (b) Other income/adjustments for the period ended 30 June 2009 amounting to $26,529,500 from interest income ($12,269,100), other/ miscellaneous income ($2,515,900) and cancellation of prior-period obligations ($11,996,300), offset by prior-period adjustments ($251,800).
