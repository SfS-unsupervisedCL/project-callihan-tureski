Rules governing compensation in the event of death, injury or illness attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations Staff Regulations of the United Nations The Staff Regulations embody the fundamental conditions of service and the basic rights, duties and obligations of the United Nations Secretariat. They represent the broad principles of human resources policy for the staffing and administration of the Secretariat. For the purposes of these Regulations, the expressions "United Nations Secretariat", "staff members" or "staff" shall refer to all the staff members of the Secretariat, within the meaning of Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations, whose employment and contractual relationship are defined by a letter of appointment subject to regulations promulgated by the General Assembly pursuant to Article 101, paragraph 1, of the Charter. The Secretary-General, as the chief administrative officer, shall provide and enforce such staff rules consistent with these principles as he or she considers necessary. Regulation 1.1 Status of staff (a) Staff members are international civil servants. Their responsibilities as staff members are not national but exclusively international; (b) Staff members shall make the following written declaration witnessed by the Secretary-General or his or her authorized representative: "I solemnly declare and promise to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions entrusted to me as an international civil servant of the United Nations, to discharge these functions and regulate my conduct with the interests of the United Nations only in view, and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my duties from any Government or other source external to the Organization. "I also solemnly declare and promise to respect the obligations incumbent upon me as set out in the Staff Regulations and Rules." (c) The Secretary-General shall ensure that the rights and duties of staff members, as set out in the Charter and the Staff Regulations and Rules and in the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly, are respected; (d) The Secretary-General shall seek to ensure that the paramount consideration in the determination of the conditions of service shall be the necessity of securing staff of the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity; (e) The Staff Regulations apply to all staff at all levels, including staff of the separately funded organs, holding appointments under the Staff Rules; (f) The privileges and immunities enjoyed by the United Nations by virtue of Article 105 of the Charter are conferred in the interests of the Organization. These privileges and immunities furnish no excuse to the staff members who are covered by them to fail to observe laws and police regulations of the State in which they are located, nor do they furnish an excuse for non-performance of their private obligations. In any case where an issue arises regarding the application of these privileges and immunities, the staff member shall immediately report the matter to the Secretary-General, who alone may decide whether such privileges and immunities exist and whether they shall be waived in accordance with the relevant instruments. Regulation 1.2 Basic rights and obligations of staff Core values (a) Staff members shall uphold and respect the principles set out in the Charter, including faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women. Consequently, staff members shall exhibit respect for all cultures; they shall not discriminate against any individual or group of individuals or otherwise abuse the power and authority vested in them; (b) Staff members shall uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity. The concept of integrity includes, but is not limited to, probity, impartiality, fairness, honesty and truthfulness in all matters affecting their work and status; General rights and obligations (c) Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to assignment by him or her to any of the activities or offices of the United Nations. In exercising this authority the Secretary-General shall seek to ensure, having regard to the circumstances, that all necessary safety and security arrangements are made for staff carrying out the responsibilities entrusted to them; (d) In the performance of their duties staff members shall neither seek nor accept instructions from any Government or from any other source external to the Organization; (e) By accepting appointment, staff members pledge themselves to discharge their functions and regulate their conduct with the interests of the Organization only in view. Loyalty to the aims, principles and purposes of the United Nations, as set forth in its Charter, is a fundamental obligation of all staff members by virtue of their status as international civil servants; (f) While staff members' personal views and convictions, including their political and religious convictions, remain inviolable, staff members shall ensure that those views and convictions do not adversely affect their official duties or the interests of the United Nations. They shall conduct themselves at all times in a manner befitting their status as international civil servants and shall not engage in any activity that is incompatible with the proper discharge of their duties with the United Nations. They shall avoid any action and, in particular, any kind of public pronouncement that may adversely reflect on their status, or on the integrity, independence and impartiality that are required by that status; (g) Staff members shall not use their office or knowledge gained from their official functions for private gain, financial or otherwise, or for the private gain of any third party, including family, friends and those they favour. Nor shall staff members use their office for personal reasons to prejudice the positions of those they do not favour; (h) Staff members may exercise the right to vote but shall ensure that their participation in any political activity is consistent with, and does not reflect adversely upon, the independence and impartiality required by their status as international civil servants; (i) Staff members shall exercise the utmost discretion with regard to all matters of official business.

These obligations do not cease upon separation from service; Honours, gifts or remuneration (j) No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from any Government; (k) If refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour or gift from a Government would cause embarrassment to the Organization, the staff member may receive it on behalf of the Organization and then report and entrust it to the Secretary-General, who will either retain it for the Organization or arrange for its disposal for the benefit of the Organization or for a charitable purpose; (l) No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from any non-governmental source without first obtaining the approval of the Secretary-General; Conflict of interest (m) A conflict of interest occurs when, by act or omission, a staff member's personal interests interfere with the performance of his or her official duties and responsibilities or with the integrity, independence and impartiality required by the staff member's status as an international civil servant. When an actual or possible conflict of interest does arise, the conflict shall be disclosed by staff members to their head of office, mitigated by the Organization and resolved in favour of the interests of the Organization; (n) All staff members at the D-1 level and above shall be required to file financial disclosure statements on appointment and at intervals thereafter as prescribed by the Secretary-General, in respect of themselves, their spouses and their dependent children, and to assist the Secretary-General in verifying the accuracy of the information submitted when so requested. The financial disclosure statements shall include certification that the assets and economic activities of the staff members, their spouses and their dependent children do not pose a conflict of interest with their official duties or the interests of the United Nations. The financial disclosure statements will remain confidential and will only be used, as prescribed by the Secretary-General, in making determinations pursuant to staff regulation 1.2 (m). The Secretary-General may require other staff to file financial disclosure statements as he or she deems necessary in the interest of the Organization; Outside employment and activities (o) Staff members shall not engage in any outside occupation or employment, whether remunerated or not, without the approval of the Secretary-General; (p) The Secretary-General may authorize staff members to engage in an outside occupation or employment, whether remunerated or not, if: (i) The outside occupation or employment does not conflict with the staff member's official functions or the status of an international civil servant; (ii) The outside occupation or employment is not against the interest of the United Nations; and (iii) The outside occupation or employment is permitted by local law at the duty station or where the occupation or employment occurs; Use of property and assets (q) Staff members shall use the property and assets of the Organization only for official purposes and shall exercise reasonable care when utilizing such property and assets; (r) Staff members must respond fully to requests for information from staff members and other officials of the Organization authorized to investigate the possible misuse of funds, waste or abuse.

Their performance will be appraised periodically to ensure that the required standards of performance are met; (b) The whole time of staff members shall be at the disposal of the Secretary-General for the performance of official functions. The Secretary-General shall establish a normal working week and shall establish official holidays for each duty station. Exceptions may be made by the Secretary-General as the needs of the service may require, and staff members shall be required to work beyond the normal tour of duty when requested to do so. Rule 1.1 (a) The declaration made by a staff member on appointment pursuant to staff regulation 1.1 (b) shall be placed in his or her official status file. A new declaration shall be made after a break in service that exceeds three months.

Specific instances of prohibited conduct (e) Any form of discrimination or harassment, including sexual or gender harassment, as well as abuse in any form at the workplace or in connection with work, is prohibited. (f) Staff members shall not disrupt or otherwise interfere with any meeting or other official activity of the Organization, including activity in connection with the administration of justice system, nor shall staff members threaten, intimidate or otherwise engage in any conduct intended, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the ability of other staff members to discharge their official functions. Staff members shall not threaten, retaliate or attempt to retaliate against such individuals or against staff members exercising their rights and duties under the present Rules.

(i) Staff members shall not seek to influence Member States, principal or subsidiary organs of the United Nations or expert groups in order to obtain a change from a position or decision taken by the Secretary-General, including decisions relating to the financing of Secretariat programmes or units, or in order to secure support for improving their personal situation or the personal situation of other staff members or for blocking or reversing unfavourable decisions regarding their status or their colleagues' status. (j) Staff members shall neither offer nor promise any favour, gift, remuneration or any other personal benefit to another staff member or to any third party with a view to causing him or her to perform, fail to perform or delay the performance of any official act. Similarly, staff members shall neither seek nor accept any favour, gift, remuneration or any other personal benefit from another staff member or from any third party in exchange for performing, failing to perform or delaying the performance of any official act. (k) No staff member shall accept any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from any Government.

(l) Acceptance by staff members of any honour, decoration, favour, gift or remuneration from non-governmental sources requires the prior approval of the Secretary-General. Approval shall be granted only in exceptional cases and where such acceptance is not incompatible with the interests of the Organization and with the staff member's status as an international civil servant. If circumstances do not allow for prior approval or if refusal of an unanticipated honour, decoration, favour or gift, including a minor gift of essentially nominal value, would cause embarrassment to the Organization, staff members may receive it on behalf of the Organization provided that it is reported and entrusted to the Secretary-General through established procedures.

(b) The number of official holidays at each duty station shall be 10 days in each calendar year, including those official holidays mandated by the General Assembly, which shall be observed at all duty stations.

(b) In the event of the death of a staff member, all amounts due to the staff member will be paid to his or her nominated beneficiary or beneficiaries, subject to application of the Staff Rules and of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund. Such payment shall afford the United Nations a complete release from all further liability in respect of any sum so paid.

Regulation 3.2 (a) The Secretary-General shall establish terms and conditions under which an education grant shall be available to a staff member residing and serving outside his or her recognized home country whose dependent child is in full-time attendance at a school, university or similar educational institution of a type that will, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, facilitate the child's reassimilation in the staff member's recognized home country. The grant shall be payable in respect of the child up to the end of the fourth year of post-secondary studies. The amount of the grant per scholastic year for each child shall be 75 per cent of the admissible educational expenses actually incurred, subject to a maximum grant as approved by the General Assembly.

Such travel shall be by a route approved by the Secretary-General but not in an amount exceeding the cost of such a journey between the home country and the duty station; (b) The Secretary-General shall also establish terms and conditions under which, at designated duty stations, an additional amount of 100 per cent of boarding costs subject to a maximum amount per year as approved by the General Assembly may be paid in respect of children in school attendance at the primary and secondary levels; (c) The Secretary-General shall also establish terms and conditions under which an education grant shall be available to a staff member serving in a country whose language is different from his or her own and who is obliged to pay tuition for the teaching of the mother tongue to a dependent child attending a local school in which the instruction is given in a language other than his or her own; (d) The Secretary-General shall also establish terms and conditions under which an education grant shall be available to a staff member whose child is unable, by reason of physical or mental disability, to attend a normal educational institution and therefore requires special teaching or training to prepare him or her for full integration into society or, while attending a normal educational institution, requires special teaching or training to assist him or her in overcoming the disability. The amount of this grant per year for each disabled child shall be equal to 100 per cent of the education expenses actually incurred, up to a maximum amount approved by the General Assembly; (e) The Secretary-General may decide in each case whether the education grant shall extend to adopted children or stepchildren.

(b) A staff member who is entitled to salary at the dependency rate shall be paid post adjustment calculated on the basis of such salary regardless of where the dependants reside. (c) While the salary of a staff member is normally subject to the post adjustment of his or her duty station during assignments for one year or more, alternative arrangements may be made by the Secretary-General under the following circumstances: (i) When a staff member is assigned to a duty station whose post adjustment classification is lower than that of his or her previous duty station, he or she may continue to receive for up to six months the post adjustment applicable to the previous duty station while at least one member of his or her immediate family (spouse and children) remains at that duty station; (ii) When a staff member is assigned to a duty station for less than one year, the Secretary-General shall decide at that time whether to apply the post adjustment applicable to the duty station and, if appropriate, to pay an assignment grant under staff rule 7.14 and the hardship and non-removal elements of the mobility and hardship allowance under staff rules 3.13, 3.14 and 7.16 (h) or, in lieu of the above, to authorize appropriate subsistence payments; (iii) When a staff member is assigned to a United Nations field mission for a period of three months or less, the Secretary-General shall decide at that time whether to apply the post adjustment applicable to the duty station and, if appropriate, to pay an assignment grant under staff rule 7.14 and the hardship and non-removal elements of the mobility and hardship allowance under staff rules 3.13, 3.14 and 7.16 (h) or, in lieu of the above, to authorize appropriate subsistence payments. (d) At duty stations where the average rental cost used in calculating the post adjustment index is based on the cost of housing provided by the United Nations, by a Government or by a related institution, eligible staff members who have to rent housing accommodation at substantially higher commercial rates will be paid a supplement to the post adjustment in the form of a rental subsidy under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

(d) In addition, in the case of a staff member holding a continuing appointment, the Secretary-General may terminate the appointment without the consent of the staff member if, in the opinion of the Secretary-General, such action would be in the interest of the good administration of the Organization, to be interpreted principally as a change or termination of a mandate, and in accordance with the standards of the Charter. Termination for abolition of posts and reduction of staff (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in paragraph (f) below and staff rule 13.1, if the necessities of service require that appointments of staff members be terminated as a result of the abolition of a post or the reduction of staff, and subject to the availability of suitable posts in which their services can be effectively utilized, provided that due regard shall be given in all cases to relative competence, integrity and length of service, staff members shall be retained in the following order of preference: (i) Staff members holding continuing appointments; (ii) Staff members recruited through competitive examinations for a career appointment serving on a two-year fixed-term appointment; (iii) Staff members holding fixed-term appointments. When the suitable posts available are subject to the principle of geographical distribution, due regard shall also be given to nationality in the case of staff members with less than five years of service and in the case of staff members who have changed their nationality within the preceding five years. (f) The provisions of paragraph (e) above insofar as they relate to staff members in the General Service and related categories shall be deemed to have been satisfied if such staff members have received consideration for suitable posts available within their parent organization at their duty stations. (g) Staff members specifically recruited for service with the United Nations Secretariat or with any programme, fund or subsidiary organ of the United Nations that enjoys a special status in matters of appointment under a resolution of the General Assembly or as a result of an agreement entered by the Secretary-General have no entitlement under this rule for consideration for posts outside the organ for which they were recruited. Termination for unsatisfactory service (h) The appointment of a staff member may be terminated for unsatisfactory service under conditions established by the Secretary-General. Termination for health reasons (i) The appointment of a staff member who has not attained the mandatory age of retirement established in the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules but whose physical or mental condition or extended illness renders him or her incapacitated for further service may be terminated after exhaustion of any sick leave entitlement. Rule 9.7 Notice of termination (a) A staff member whose continuing appointment is to be terminated shall be given not less than three months' written notice of such termination. (b) A staff member whose fixed-term appointment is to be terminated shall be given not less than 30 calendar days' written notice of such termination or such written notice as may otherwise be stipulated in his or her letter of appointment.

(e) No termination notice or compensation in lieu thereof shall be given in case of dismissal. Rule 9.8 (a) Payment of termination indemnity under staff regulation 9.3 and annex III to the Staff Regulations shall be calculated: (i) For staff in the Professional and higher categories, on the basis of the staff member's gross salary less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (i); (ii) For staff in the Field Service category, on the basis of the staff member's gross salary less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (i), plus language allowance, if any; (iii) For staff in the General Service and related categories, on the basis of the staff member's gross salary, including language allowance, if any, less staff assessment, according to the schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (ii) applied to the gross salary alone. (b) Length of service shall be deemed to comprise the total period of a staff member's full-time continuous service on fixed-term or continuing appointments. Continuity of such service shall not be considered as broken by periods of special leave. However, service credits shall not accrue during periods of special leave with partial pay or without pay of one full month or more. (c) Termination indemnity shall not be paid to any staff member who, upon separation from service, will receive a retirement benefit under article 28 of the Regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund or compensation for total disability under staff rule 6.4. (d) Upon application of a staff member who is to be separated as a result of an agreed termination of appointment or because of abolition of post or reduction in staff and who is within 2 years of age 55 years and 25 years of contributory service in the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund or who is over that age and within 2 years of 25 years of contributory service, the Secretary-General may place such staff member on special leave without pay for pension purposes pursuant to staff rule 5.3 (c) under conditions to be established by the Secretary-General. (e) The Organization will, on the written request of the staff member prior to being placed on special leave pursuant to the preceding paragraph, pay the pension contribution of the Organization and/or the staff member during the period of special leave. The total amount of these contributions will be deducted from the termination indemnity otherwise payable. (f) A staff member selecting the option of special leave described in staff rule 9.8 (d) shall sign an undertaking acknowledging that his or her status on special leave is solely for pension purposes and that his or her entitlements and those in respect of any dependants to all other emoluments and benefits under the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules are determined as final as at the date of commencement of such special leave. Rule 9.9 Commutation of accrued annual leave If on separation from service a staff member has accrued annual leave, he or she shall be paid a sum of money in commutation of the period of such accrued leave up to a maximum of 18 working days for staff holding a temporary appointment and up to a maximum of 60 working days for staff holding a fixed-term or continuing appointment, in accordance with staff rules 4.18 and 5.1. The payment shall be calculated: (i) For staff in the Professional and higher categories, on the basis of the staff member's net base salary plus post adjustment; (ii) For staff in the Field Service category, on the basis of the staff member's net base salary plus post adjustment; (iii) For staff in the General Service and related categories, on the basis of the staff member's gross salary, including language allowance, if any, less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set forth in staff Rule 9.10 Restitution of advance annual and sick leave On separation, a staff member who has taken advance annual or sick leave beyond that which he or she has subsequently accrued shall make restitution for such advance leave by means of a cash refund or an offset against monies due to the staff member from the United Nations, equivalent to the remuneration received, including allowances and other payments, in respect of the advance leave period. The Secretary-General may waive this requirement if in his or her opinion there are exceptional or compelling reasons for doing so. Rule 9.11 Last day for pay purposes (a) When a staff member is separated from service, the date on which entitlement to salary, allowances and benefits shall cease shall be determined according to the following provisions: (i) In the case of resignation, the date shall be either the date of expiration of the notice period under staff rule 9.2 or such other date as the Secretary-General accepts. A staff member will be expected to perform his or her duties during the period of notice of resignation, except when the resignation takes effect upon the completion of maternity or paternity leave or following sick or special leave. Annual leave will be granted during the period of notice only for brief periods; (ii) In the case of abandonment of post, the date shall be the date of the decision by the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Resources Management to terminate the appointment or the expiry date specified in the letter of appointment, whichever is earlier; (iii) In the case of expiration of a temporary or fixed-term appointment, the date shall be the date specified in the letter of appointment; (iv) In the case of retirement, the date shall be the date approved by the Secretary-General for retirement; (v) In the case of termination, the date shall be the date provided in the notice of termination; (vi) In the case of dismissal, the date shall be the date on which the staff member is notified in writing of the decision to dismiss him or her; (vii) In the case of death, the date on which entitlement to salary, allowances and benefits shall cease shall be the date of death, unless there is a surviving spouse or dependent child. In that event, the date shall be determined in accordance with the following schedule: Completed years of service (as defined in rule 9.8) Months of salary 3 or less 9 or more The months of salary referenced above may be made in a lump sum as soon as the pay accounts and related matters can be closed. Such payment shall be made only to the surviving spouse and dependent children. For staff in the Professional and higher categories, the payment shall be calculated on the basis of the staff member's gross salary less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (i). For staff in the Field Service category, the payment shall be calculated on the basis of the staff member's gross salary less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (i), plus language allowance, if any. For staff in the General Service and related categories, the payment shall be calculated on the basis of the staff member's gross salary, including language allowance, if any, less staff assessment according to the schedule of rates set forth in staff regulation 3.3 (b) (ii) applied to the gross salary alone. All other entitlements and accrual of benefits shall cease as at the date of death, except as provided by staff rule 3.9 (f) for payment of education grant when the staff member dies while in service after the beginning of a school year. (b) When an internationally recruited staff member has an entitlement to return travel under staff rule 7.1 (a) (iv), this shall not affect the determination of the last day for pay purposes in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above. In the case of resignation, expiration of temporary or fixed-term appointment, termination or retirement, the staff member shall be paid, on separation, an additional amount for days of authorized travel estimated on the basis of uninterrupted travel by an approved route, mode and standard of travel from the duty station to the place of entitlement to return travel. Such amount shall be calculated as is done for the commutation of accrued annual leave under staff rule 9.9 above. Rule 9.12 Certification of service Any staff member who so requests shall, on leaving the service of the United Nations, be given a statement relating to the nature of his or her duties and the length of service.

Rule 10.1 Misconduct (a) Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant may amount to misconduct and may lead to the institution of a disciplinary process and the imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct. (b) Where the staff member's failure to comply with his or her obligations or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant is determined by the Secretary-General to constitute misconduct, such staff member may be required to reimburse the United Nations either partially or in full for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of his or her actions, if such actions are determined to be wilful, reckless or grossly negligent. (c) The decision to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct, to institute a disciplinary process and to impose a disciplinary measure shall be within the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General or officials with delegated authority.

These include, but are not limited to, the following administrative measures: (i) Written or oral reprimand; (ii) Recovery of monies owed to the Organization; (iii) Administrative leave with or without pay pursuant to staff rule 10.4. Rule 10.3 Due process in the disciplinary process (a) The Secretary-General may initiate the disciplinary process where the findings of an investigation indicate that misconduct may have occurred. In such cases, no disciplinary measure or non-disciplinary measure, except as provided under staff rule 10.2 (b) (iii), may be imposed on a staff member following the completion of an investigation unless he or she has been notified, in writing, of the charges against him or her, and has been given the opportunity to respond to those charges. The staff member shall also be informed of the right to seek the assistance of counsel in his or her defence through the Office of Staff Legal Assistance, or from outside counsel at his or her own expense. (b) Any disciplinary measure imposed on a staff member shall be proportionate to the nature and gravity of his or her misconduct. (c) A staff member against whom disciplinary or non-disciplinary measures, pursuant to staff rule 10.2, have been imposed following the completion of a disciplinary process may submit an application challenging the imposition of such measures directly to the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, in accordance with chapter XI of the Staff Rules. (d) An appeal against a judgement of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal by the staff member or by the Secretary-General may be filed with the United Nations Appeals Tribunal in accordance with chapter XI of the Staff Rules. Rule 10.4 Administrative leave pending investigation and the disciplinary process (a) A staff member may be placed on administrative leave, subject to conditions specified by the Secretary-General, at any time pending an investigation until the completion of the disciplinary process. (b) A staff member placed on administrative leave pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be given a written statement of the reason(s) for such leave and its probable duration, which, so far as practicable, should not exceed three months. (c) Administrative leave shall be with full pay unless, in exceptional circumstances, the Secretary-General decides that administrative leave without pay is warranted. (d) Placement on administrative leave shall be without prejudice to the rights of the staff member and shall not constitute a disciplinary measure. If administrative leave is without pay and either the allegations of misconduct are subsequently not sustained or it is subsequently found that the conduct at issue does not warrant dismissal, any pay withheld shall be restored without delay. (e) A staff member who has been placed on administrative leave may challenge the decision to place him or her on such leave in accordance with chapter XI of the Staff Rules. Article XI Regulation 11.1 There shall be a two-tier formal system of administration of justice: (a) The United Nations Dispute Tribunal shall, under conditions prescribed in its statute and rules, hear and render judgement on an application from a staff member alleging non-compliance with his or her terms of appointment or the contract of employment, including all pertinent regulations and rules; (b) The United Nations Appeals Tribunal shall, under conditions prescribed in its statute and rules, exercise appellate jurisdiction over an appeal of a judgement rendered by the United Nations Dispute Tribunal submitted by either party. Rule 11.1 Informal resolution (a) A staff member who considers that his or her contract of employment or terms of appointment have been violated is encouraged to attempt to have the matter resolved informally. To that end, a staff member who wishes to pursue informal channels should approach the Office of the Ombudsman without delay, without prejudice to the right to pursue the matter formally in accordance with the provisions of the present chapter. (b) Both the staff member and the Secretary-General may initiate informal resolution, including mediation, of the issues involved at any time before or after the staff member chooses to pursue the matter formally. (c) The conduct of informal resolution by the Office of the Ombudsman, including mediation, may result in the extension of the deadlines applicable to management evaluation and to the filing of an application with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, as specified in staff rules 11.2 (c) and (d) and 11.4 (c) below. (d) An application shall not be receivable by the United Nations Dispute Tribunal if the dispute arising from a contested decision has been resolved by an agreement reached through mediation. However, a staff member may submit an application directly with the Dispute Tribunal to enforce the implementation of an agreement reached through mediation within 90 calendar days of the deadline for implementation as specified in the mediation agreement or, when the mediation agreement is silent on the matter, within 90 calendar days of the thirtieth calendar day from the date on which the agreement was signed. Rule 11.2 Management evaluation (a) A staff member wishing to formally contest an administrative decision alleging non-compliance with his or her contract of employment or terms of appointment, including all pertinent regulations and rules pursuant to staff regulation 11.1 (a), shall, as a first step, submit to the Secretary-General in writing a request for a management evaluation of the administrative decision. (b) A staff member wishing to formally contest an administrative decision taken pursuant to advice obtained from technical bodies, as determined by the Secretary-General, or of a decision taken at Headquarters in New York to impose a disciplinary or non-disciplinary measure pursuant to staff rule 10.2 following the completion of a disciplinary process is not required to request a management evaluation. (c) A request for a management evaluation shall not be receivable by the Secretary-General unless it is sent within 60 calendar days from the date on which the staff member received notification of the administrative decision to be contested. This deadline may be extended by the Secretary-General pending efforts for informal resolution conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman, under conditions specified by the Secretary-General. (d) The Secretary-General's response, reflecting the outcome of the management evaluation, shall be communicated in writing to the staff member within 30 calendar days of receipt of the request for management evaluation if the staff member is stationed in New York, and within 45 calendar days of receipt of the request for management evaluation if the staff member is stationed outside of New York. The deadline may be extended by the Secretary-General pending efforts for informal resolution by the Office of the Ombudsman, under conditions specified by the Secretary-General. Rule 11.3 Suspension of action (a) Neither the submission of a request for a management evaluation nor the filing of an application with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal shall have the effect of suspending the implementation of the contested administrative decision. (b) However, where a management evaluation of an administrative decision is required: (i) A staff member may submit an application requesting the United Nations Dispute Tribunal to suspend the implementation of the contested administrative decision until the management evaluation has been completed and the staff member has received notification of the outcome. In accordance with article 2, paragraph 2, of its statute, the Dispute Tribunal may suspend the implementation of a decision where the decision appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of particular urgency and where its implementation would cause irreparable damage. The Dispute Tribunal's decision on such an application is not subject to appeal; (ii) In cases involving separation from service, a staff member may opt to first request the Secretary-General to suspend the implementation of the decision until the management evaluation has been completed and the staff member has received notification of the outcome. The Secretary-General may suspend the implementation of a decision where he or she determines that the contested decision has not yet been implemented, the decision appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of particular urgency and where its implementation would cause irreparable damage to the staff member's rights. If the Secretary-General rejects the request, the staff member may then submit a request for suspension of action to the Dispute Tribunal under subparagraph (b) (i) above. Rule 11.4 United Nations Dispute Tribunal (a) A staff member may file an application against a contested administrative decision, whether or not it has been amended by any management evaluation, with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar days from the date on which the staff member received the outcome of the management evaluation or from the date of expiration of the deadline specified under staff rule 11.2 (d), whichever is earlier. (b) Where a staff member is not required to request a management evaluation, pursuant to staff rule 11.2 (b), he or she may file an application directly with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar days from the date on which the staff member received notification of the contested administrative decision. (c) Where mediation has been pursued by either party within the deadline for filing an application with the United Nations Dispute Tribunal specified in staff rule 11.4 (a) or (b) and the mediation is deemed to have failed in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Mediation Division of the Office of the Ombudsman, the staff member may file an application with the Dispute Tribunal within 90 calendar days of the end of the mediation. (d) A staff member shall have the assistance of counsel through the Office of Staff Legal Assistance if he or she so wishes, or may obtain outside counsel at his or her expense, in the presentation of his or her case before the United Nations Dispute Tribunal. (e) A staff association may request permission from the United Nations Dispute Tribunal to submit a friend-of-the-court brief in relation to an application filed by a staff member. (f) A staff member who is entitled to appeal the same administrative decision that is the subject of an application brought by another staff member may request permission from the United Nations Dispute Tribunal to intervene in the matter. (g) In accordance with article 2, paragraph 1, of its statute, the United Nations Dispute Tribunal has jurisdiction over applications filed by staff members: (i) To appeal an administrative decision that is alleged to not be in compliance with a staff member's contract of employment or terms of appointment, including all pertinent regulations and rules and relevant administrative issuances in force at the time of the alleged non-compliance; (ii) To appeal an administrative decision imposing a disciplinary measure; (iii) To enforce the implementation of an agreement reached through mediation. (h) The competence of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, as set forth in its statute, includes the authority: (i) To suspend proceedings in a case at the request of the parties for a time to be specified by it in writing; (ii) To order, at any time during the proceedings, an interim measure, which is not subject to appeal, to provide temporary relief to either party where the contested decision appears prima facie to be unlawful, in cases of particular urgency, and where its implementation would cause irreparable damage. Such temporary relief may include suspension of the implementation of the contested administrative decision, except in cases of appointment, promotion or termination; (iii) To refer, at any time during its deliberations, a matter to mediation with the consent of both parties. Rule 11.5 United Nations Appeals Tribunal (a) In accordance with article 2, paragraph 1, of its statute, the United Nations Appeals Tribunal shall have jurisdiction over an appeal against a judgement of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal alleging that the Dispute Tribunal has: (i) Exceeded its jurisdiction or competence; (ii) Failed to exercise jurisdiction vested in it; (iii) Erred on a question of law; (iv) Committed an error in procedure, such as to affect the decision of the case; or (v) Erred on a question of fact, resulting in a manifestly unreasonable decision. (b) An appeal may be filed by either party against the judgement of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal within 45 calendar days following receipt of the Dispute Tribunal's judgement. An appeal shall not be receivable by the United Nations Appeals Tribunal unless the deadline has been met or has been waived or suspended by the Appeals Tribunal. (c) The filing of an appeal with the United Nations Appeals Tribunal shall have the effect of suspending the execution of a judgement of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal that is contested. (d) A staff member shall have the assistance of counsel through the Office of Staff Legal Assistance if he or she so wishes, or may obtain outside counsel at his or her expense in the presentation of his or her case before the United Nations Appeals Tribunal. (e) The competence of the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, as set forth in its statute, includes the authority: (i) To decide, at its own initiative or at the request of either party, that exceptional circumstances require the proceedings to be closed; (ii) To order an interim measure to provide temporary relief to either party to prevent irreparable harm and to maintain consistency with the judgement of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal.

(j) The provisions of staff rule 6.4 relating to death, injury or illness attributable to the performance of official duties on behalf of the United Nations shall not be applicable during periods of military service.
