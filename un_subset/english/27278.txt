United Nations Commission on International Trade Law UNCITRAL Digest of case law on the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods* Article 38 (1) The buyer must examine the goods, or cause them to be examined, within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances. (2) If the contract involves carriage of the goods, examination may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at their destination. (3) If the goods are redirected in transit or redispatched by the buyer without a reasonable opportunity for examination by him and at the time of the conclusion of the contract the seller knew or ought to have known of the possibility of such redirection or redispatch, examination may be deferred until after the goods have arrived at the new destination. Overview of Article 38 1. Article 38 directs a buyer to whom goods have been delivered to examine them or cause them to be examined. Much of the text of article 38 focuses on the time when this examination should take place. Thus article 38 (1) specifies the general rule that the examination must occur "within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances." Article 38 (2) provides a special rule for cases involving carriage of goods, permitting the examination to be deferred until the goods arrive at their destination. With respect to the relationship between articles 38 (1) and 38 (2), one court has explained that normally the place of examination is the place where the seller's delivery obligation is performed under article 31 of the Convention, but if the contract involves carriage of the goods the examination may be deferred until the goods reach their destination.1 Article 38 (3) contains another special rule, applicable if the buyer redirects goods while they are in transit or redispatches goods before having a reasonable opportunity to examine them: in such cases, examination may be deferred until after the goods arrive at their "new destination," provided the seller was on notice of the possibility of such redirection or redispatch when the contract was concluded. 2. As is asserted by the Secretariat Commentary relating to article 382 and by numerous cases,3 the time when a buyer is required to conduct an examination of the goods under article 38 is intimately connected to the time when the buyer "ought to have discovered" a lack of conformity under article 39an occurrence that starts the clock running on the buyer's obligation to give notice of the non-conformity. The examination obligation imposed by article 38, therefore, can have very serious consequences: if a buyer fails to detect a lack of conformity because it did not conduct a proper and timely examination, and as a result fails to give the notice required by article 39, the buyer will lose rightsquite possibly all rightsrelating to the lack of conformity.4 3. The obligation to examine under article 38 (and to give notice of lack of conformity under article 39) applies not just to non-conformities under CISG article 35, but also to non-conformities under contractual provisions that derogate from article 35.5 The examination mandated by article 38, furthermore, should ascertain not only that the quality, quantity, capabilities and features of the goods conform to the seller's obligations, but also that the goods are accompanied by documentation required by the contract.6 4. According to several opinions, the purpose of the article 38 examination obligation, in conjunction with the notice requirement imposed by article 39, is to make it clear, in an expeditious fashion, whether the seller has properly performed the contract.7 In this regard, article 38 is similar to rules commonly found in domestic sales lawand, indeed, article 38 has been applied as a matter of "international trade usage" even though the States of neither the buyer nor the seller had, at the time of the transaction, ratified the Convention.8 Article 38, however, is a provision of international uniform law distinct from similar domestic rules,9 and is to be interpreted (pursuant to article 7 (1)) from an international perspective and with a view to promoting uniformity in its application.10 It has been asserted that the requirements of article 38 are to be strictly applied.11 Article 38 (1) in general 5. Article 38 (1) mandates that the buyer "examine the goods, or cause them to be examined, within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances." The meaning of the phrase specifying the time within which the examination must be conducted"as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances"has been addressed in many decisions.12 The text of article 38 (1) does not expressly address the type or method of examination required, and this issue has also generated substantial comment in the cases.13 6. Under article 6 of the Convention, the parties can derogate from or vary the effect of any provision of the CISG. This principle has been applied to article 38, and an agreement concerning the time and/or manner of the examination of goods has been found to supersede the usual rules of article 38.14 On the other hand, it has been found that contractual provisions addressing the terms and duration of warranties, the buyer's obligation to give notice of defects occurring after delivery, and the buyer's rights if the seller did not cure defects, did not displace the provisions of article 38.15 Derogation from article 38 can also occur by trade usage,16 although the express terms of the agreement may negate the applicability of a usage.17 7. After the goods have been delivered, the seller may waive its right to object to the propriety of the buyer's examination of the goods,18 or it may be stopped from asserting such right.19 On the other side, it has been asserted that a buyer may lose its rights to object to a lack of conformity if the buyer takes actions indicating acceptance of the goods without complaining of defects that it had discovered or should have discovered in its examination.20 8. Evidentiary questions can play a crucial role in determining whether a buyer has met its obligations under article 38 (1). Several decisions have asserted that the buyer bears the burden of proving that it conducted a proper examination.21 In determining whether an adequate examination was conducted, furthermore, it has been asserted that a tribunal should consider both "objective" and "subjective" factors, including the buyer's "personal and business situation."22 Some decisions appear in fact to take into account the buyer's subjective circumstances in judging the adequacy of an examination, at least where such considerations suggest a high standard for the examination.23 Other decisions, however, have refused to consider the buyer's particular situation when it was invoked to argue for a low standard for the examination.24 Method of examination 9. By stating that the buyer must either examine the goods or "cause them to be examined," article 38 (1) implies that the buyer need not personally carry out the examination. In a number of cases, examinations were (or should have been) conducted by a person or entity other than the buyer, including the buyer's customer,25 subcontractor,26 or an expert appointed by the buyer.27 It has also been held, however, that the buyer bears ultimate responsibility under article 38 for examinations carried out by others.28 10. Except for implying that the examination need not be carried out by the buyer personally, article 38 (1) is silent about the method the buyer should employ in examining the goods. In general, it has been asserted, the manner of inspection will depend on the parties' agreement, trade usages and practices29; and that in the absence of such indicators a "reasonable" examination, "thorough and professional" is required, although "costly and expensive examinations are unreasonable."30 It has also been asserted that the extent and intensity of the examination are determined by the type of goods, packaging and the capabilities of the typical buyer.31 The issues relating to the method or manner of examination that have been addressed in decisions include: the impact of the buyer's expertise on the level of examination required32; whether spot testing or "sampling" is required33 or adequate34; the effect of the packaging or shipping condition of the goods on the type of examination the buyer should conduct35; whether an outside expert can or must be utilized36; and whether the presence or absence of defects in earlier deliveries or transactions should affect the manner of examination.37 Time period for examination 11. Article 38 (1) states that the buyer must examine the goods "within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances." It has been asserted that the purpose of the deadline for examination established in article 38 (1) is to allow the buyer an opportunity to discover defects before the buyer resells,38 and to permit prompt clarification of whether the buyer accepts the goods as conforming,39 but the period for examination has been interpreted in a fashion that serves other purposesfor example, to mandate examination before the condition of the goods so changes that the opportunity to determine if the seller is responsible for a lack of conformity is lost.40 12. Except where the contract involves carriage of the goods (a situation governed by article 38 (2), discussed below) or where the goods are redirected in transit or redispatched (circumstances handled in article 38 (3), discussed below), the time for the buyer's examination as a rule begins to run upon delivery of the goods41which in general corresponds to the time risk of loss passed to the buyer.42 Requiring the buyer to conduct an examination after delivery, therefore, is consistent with article 36 (1) of the Convention, which establishes the seller's liability for any lack of conformity existing when the risk passes. Where the lack of conformity is a hidden or latent one not reasonably discoverable in the initial examination, however, decisions have indicated that the period for conducting an examination to ascertain the defect does not begin to run until the defects reveal (or should reveal) themselves. Thus where a buyer alleged a lack of conformity in a grinding device that suffered a complete failure approximately two weeks after being put into service (approximately three weeks after delivery), one court indicated that the period for examining the goods with respect to this defect began to run at the time of the failure.43 13. The mandate in article 38 (1) to examine the goods "within as short a period as is practicable" has indeed been applied in a strict fashion in several cases.44 It has also been asserted that the phrase is to be strictly interpreted.45 In light of the requirement in article 38 (1) that the time period for examination be one that is "practicable in the circumstances," however, decisions have also recognized that the standard is a flexible one, and that the period for examination will vary with the facts of each case. According to one court, the short period for the examination depends on the size of the buyer's company, the type of the goods to be examined, their complexity or perishability or their character as seasonal goods, the type of the amount in question, the efforts necessary for an examination, etc. Furthermore, the objective and subjective circumstances of the concrete case must be considered, in particular the buyer's personal and business situation, characteristic features of the goods, the amount of the delivery of goods or the type of the chosen legal remedy.46 14. As the aforementioned statement indicates, the perishable nature of goods is a factor that tribunals have considered in determining the period for examination.47 Other factors that the decisions recognize as relevant include the professionalism and/or expertise of the buyer,48 the timing and nature of the buyer's expected use or resale of the goods,49 the buyer's knowledge of the seller's need for speedy notice of lack of conformity,50 whether the goods had passed a pre-delivery inspection,51 whether there were non-business days during the period for examination,52 the complexity of the goods,53 the difficulty of conducting an examination,54 whether there were defects in prior deliveries,55 and the obviousness (or non-obviousness) of the lack of conformity.56 15. Although the flexibility and variability of the period within which the buyer must examine the goods is widely recognized, several decisions have attempted to establish presumptive time periods for the buyer's examination. Thus some opinions have asserted that the general base-line period for examination (which might be lengthened or shortened by particular circumstances) is one week after delivery.57 Other decisions have set presumptive examination periods ranging from three or four days58 to a month.59 Based on the facts of the particular case, examinations have been found timely when they were conducted within approximately two weeks of the first delivery under the contract,60 within a few days after delivery at the port of destination,61 and on the day of delivery.62 An examination by an expert was also deemed timely when it was conducted and completed at an unspecified time following delivery, but where arrangements to have the expert examine the goods were initiated before the goods arrived at their destination.63 Examinations in the following periods have been found to be untimely in the particular circumstances: four months after the delivery of the second of two engines (20 months after the delivery of the first engine)64; more than 10 days following delivery65; beyond one week to 10 days after delivery66; beyond one week following delivery67; more than a few days after delivery68; after three or four days following delivery69; beyond three days after delivery70; after the day of arrival at the port of destination71; any time later than immediately following delivery.72 Latent lack of conformity 16. The question of the buyer's obligation to examine the goods for a hidden or latent lack of conformity not discernible during an initial inspection73 is an important one because article 39 (1) of the Convention requires the buyer to give notice of a lack of conformity "within a reasonable time after [the buyer] discovered or ought to have discovered it" (emphasis added). Tribunals have adopted different approaches to examination for latent defects, apparently varying with the view taken of the nature of the examination required by article 38. Some decisions appear to conceive of the article 38 examination as an ongoing or repeated process involving a continuous search for all non-conformities, including latent ones. Such decisions seem to treat the question of when the buyer ought to have found any defect, including a latent one not discoverable in an initial examination, as an issue governed by article 38, on the apparent assumption that article 38 requires the buyer to continue examining the goods until all defects are revealed. Thus some decisions indicate that the period for an article 38 examination for latent defects does not begin to run until such defects should reveal themselves,74 whereas the period for examination of obvious defects begins to run immediately upon delivery.75 These opinions apparently contemplate multiple or continuous examinations under article 38. Other decisions appear to conceive of the examination required by article 38 as a single discrete event to occur shortly after delivery. For tribunals adopting this approach, the question of when latent defects should be discovered if they are not reasonably discernible in the initial article 38 examination is an issue beyond the scope of article 38.76 17. Illustrating this approach, one decision has emphasized that the article 38 examination occurs upon delivery of the goods, and failure to discern a lack of conformity that was not discoverable at the time does not violate article 38.77 Article 38 (2) 18. As was noted previously, under article 38 (1) the period for the buyer to examine the goods as a rule begins to run upon delivery of the goods.78 Where such delivery is to occur, in turn, is governed by the sales contract or, in the absence of a contractual provision addressing this question, by the default rules stated in article 31.79 In many transactions in which the goods will be delivered to the buyer by means of a third-party carrier, the place of delivery will be where the seller hands over the goods to the carrier for transportation.80 In such cases, it will often not be convenient or even possible for the buyer to examine the goods at the point of delivery, and thus in fairness the period for examination should not begin running at that point. For this reason, in transactions involving "carriage of goods" (i.e., transportation by third-party carrier), article 38 (2) permits the buyer to defer the examination "until after the goods have arrived at their destination." This rule has been applied in several cases. In one transaction involving goods to be transported from Tallinn, Estonia to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, the court found that the buyer could postpone examination until the goods arrived at Abu Dhabi even though the contract provided for delivery FOB Tallinn.81 On the other hand, article 38 (2) is subject to the contrary agreement of the parties.82 Thus where a contract between a seller and a buyer provided that the goods were to be delivered "free on refrigerated truck Turkish loading berth (Torbali)" and from there to be shipped on to the buyer's country by carrier, the court found that the parties' agreement had excluded article 38 (2) and the buyer was required to conduct the article 38 examination in Turkey rather than at the place of arrival, because the contract contemplated that a representative of the buyer would inspect the goods at the Turkish loading dock and the buyer was responsible for making arrangements for transporting the goods to its country.83 Article 38 (3) 19. Article 38 (3) permits a buyer in certain circumstances to defer examination of the goods until after the time that the period for examination would otherwise have commenced.84 Specifically, where the goods are "redirected in transit" or "redispatched by the buyer without a reasonable opportunity for examination by him,"85 article 38 (3) permits examination to be deferred "until after the goods have arrived at the new destination," provided the seller "knew or ought to have known of the possibility of such redirection or redispatch" when the contract was concluded. Under this provision, an examination of a delivery of rare hard woods that the buyer (with the seller's knowledge) redispatched to the buyer's customer could be deferred until the goods arrived at the customer's facilities.86 Several decisions, however, have strictly construed the requirements for article 38 (3) to apply. Thus it has been stated that the provision only applies if the goods are delivered directly from the seller to the end customer or if the buyer acts simply as an intermediary between the seller and the end customer, and the provision was held inapplicable where the buyer received and stored the goods in its own warehouse without knowing in advance whether and when they would be resold.87 It has also been stated that article 38 (3) allows a deferred examination only if all (rather than just a part) of a delivery of goods is redispatched, or redirected in transit, and then only if the buyer does not have a reasonable opportunity to examine the delivery.88
