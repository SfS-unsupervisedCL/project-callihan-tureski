[English only] Written statement by the National Centre for Human Rights of Jordan (NCHR) 20th Session of the Human Rights Council (18 June - 06 July 2012) On the occasion of the Human Rights Council Discussion of the Report Submitted by the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women; its causes and consequences. The National Centre for Human Rights of Jordan (NCHR) welcomes the report of the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women which contains the findings of her visit to Jordan from 11-24 November 2011. One of the highlights of that visit was the broad consultation process organized by the Jordanian Government with the stakeholder prior and during the visit of the Special Rapporteur which aimed at coordinating national efforts in facilitating the said visit. NCHR hopes for applying such a participatory approach to similar future visits. The report provides an overview of the implications of the political and economic conditions for women's rights in Jordan, assesses the legislative and institutional frameworks in relation to violence against women, sheds light on the main challenges and provides a number of recommendations. Further, the report indicates the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach and practical solutions in addressing the empowerment of women to achieve substantive equality and not just formal one. This requires providing legislative and institutional frameworks that guarantee adequate protection for women in general and women victims of violence in particular. Raising awareness campaigns targeting different societal groups along with the involvement of media, religious leaders, parliamentarians and other concerned stakeholders are factors that lead to better enjoyment of human rights by women and reduce acts of inequality and discrimination. NCHR also stresses on the need for further enhancing cooperation and coordination between concerned government institutions, non-governmental organizations and national independent institutions in the area of eliminating violence and discrimination against women through: Launching a national dialogue to address the legislative gaps in addressing violence against women and provide a set of widely adopted recommendations to amend national legislation in conformity with Jordan's international obligations and in the manner that aims at improving the situation of women's civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights. Reviewing and evaluating the effectiveness of current policies and practices in providing protection to women victims of violence, identifying gaps and suggesting practical solutions. Monitoring and assessing the implementation of national protective measures both at the legislative and institutional levels that aim at providing adequate protection for women victims of violence (whether domestic violence or other types of violence against women) in a manner that would improve the level and quality of protection provided to women. Establishing a national observatory to document cases and types of violence against women, provide an understanding of the trends and patterns of violence against women and develop monitoring tools to evaluate progress made in eradicating violence against women in a clear systematic way. (NCHR) would like to point out its support to specific recommendations that were included in its annual reports on the status of human rights in the Kingdom Including the explicit prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex and gender within article (6) of the Constitution; Amending the Nationality Act to grant Jordanian women the right to confer their citizenship on their children, and remove the reservation to article 9 of CEDAW with regard to granting equal rights to women with respect to nationality; Adopting further affirmative action measures to increase the participation of women in the political life, in order to reverse gender imbalances, including by appointing a larger number of women to the judiciary and as senior level officials in the executive and judicial branches at the national and local levels; Ensuring adequate and fair sentences in cases of killings of women committed in the name of "honour". Eliminating the practice of protective custody of women in the Reform and Rehabilitation Centres and, together with non-governmental organizations, establish programmes to guarantee long-term rehabilitation and housing solutions for women victims of violence who do not have the support of their families, and/or who are under threat; Training and sensitize the media in issues related to women's rights generally and violence against women in particular, in order to contribute to changing the predominant social and cultural beliefs and attitudes that perpetuate harmful stereotypes and myths about women; Establishing a standardized system for the collection and analysis of data, disaggregated by sex, race, age, ethnicity and other relevant characteristics, in order to understand the magnitude, trends and patterns of violence against women in the country; Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to announce that NCHR will be hosting the 11th International Conference of NHRIs in November this year. The overall theme of the Conference is "Human Rights of Women and Girls, Gender Based Equality: The Role of National Human Rights Institutions". It will be a platform for NHRIs and other participants to discuss the current situation of women's rights and gender in light of the relevant human rights standards. NHRIs will seek to share experience and best practices in their work to promote and protect women's rights. In this endeavour they will focus on how to alleviate the unequal status of women and girls in their respective societies with special focus on the obstacles - cultural, structural- that underpin such status. Further, discussions will include practical suggestions on how to empower women in order for them to achieve new heights in their advancement. All these issues as well as others will constitute the backbone of the final declaration of the Conference (Amman Declaration) as well as establish a common understanding of the needs of women and draw the attention of NHRIs and other parties to such vital issues.
