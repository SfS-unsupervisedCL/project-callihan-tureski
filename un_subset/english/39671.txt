Sixty-first session Agenda item 27 Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and development Letter dated 27 April 2007 from the Permanent Representative of Georgia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Herewith, I would like to draw your attention to the ongoing photo exhibition at United Nations Headquarters on the contribution of the Russian Federation to the various peacekeeping operations and, in particular, to the inaccuracies in its titles. First of all, I would like to express our respect for the contributions of the States Members of the United Nations to peacekeeping operations around the globe. Regrettably, the titles of the photos displaying activities of the joint peacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States in the conflict zone of Georgia omit the name of the State Member of the United Nations on whose territory the peacekeepers are temporarily deployed. The geographical names and some facts are inaccurate and contradict not only their originality but also official United Nations language and Security Council resolutions. It is particularly disturbing that in the United Nations Headquarters building, we are witnessing an event that disregards all the United Nations documents and provides incorrect information. It is even more unfortunate that all this is piloted by the State which is very much familiar with the peculiarities of the conflict and has the capacity of one of the facilitators. I would like to reiterate that the exploitation of inaccurate definitions with regard to the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, by a facilitator country creates confusion and mistrust concerning its impartiality and constructive approach. I should be grateful if the present letter could be circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 27. (Signed) Irakli Alasania Ambassador Permanent Representative
