(Signed) Richard Ryan Permanent Representative of Ireland to the United Nations [Original: English and French] Statement on 10 years of democracy in South Africa issued on 27 April 2004 by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union The European Union extends warm congratulations and good wishes to the Government and people of South Africa on the tenth anniversary of the achievement of democracy. The European Union recognizes South Africa's remarkable achievement in establishing a strong and functioning democracy in a post-apartheid context. Faced with the legacy of the all-encompassing evil that was the apartheid regime, the European Union acknowledges South Africa's significant progress in terms of economic, social and constitutional reform. South Africa has taken an active role on the international stage, especially on the continent of Africa in its continued efforts to bring peace to troubled regions and in supporting the economic revitalization of the continent. The European Union looks forward to working closely with South Africa in the further deepening of our bilateral relations and in international forums. The acceding countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, the candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, the countries of the stabilization and association process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.
