UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/539 12 April 1999 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: ARABIC IDENTICAL LETTERS DATED 11 MAY 1999 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL AND TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to inform you that, between 1 and 7 May 1999, United States and British aircraft, taking off from their bases in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey, continued to violate Iraqi airspace, carrying out acts of aggression, observation and provocation, as specified in the list annexed hereto. I should be grateful if you would intervene with the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the States which are providing them with facilities in order to commit these acts of aggression, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey, so that these acts, which endanger the sovereignty and unity of the territory of the Republic of Iraq and constitute blatant violations of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law, will be halted. These acts continue to cause deaths and injuries among the civilian population and material damage to public and private property. The logistical support provided by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the Americans and the British makes them essential accomplices in the aggression against Iraq, and they therefore bear international responsibility for these acts. The Republic of Iraq reaffirms its right to demand reparation for the harm inflicted on the Iraqi people through the aforementioned acts. I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Saeed H.
