General Assembly Security Council Fifty-fourth session Fifty-fifth year Agenda items 116 (a) and (d) Human rights questions: implementation of human rights instruments; comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action Letter dated 16 June 2000 from the Permanent Representative of Eritrea to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to transmit a comprehensive statement issued today, 16 June, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Eritrea in response to a resolution of the Ethiopian Parliament adopted on 13 June 2000 concerning the human rights of Ethiopians living in Eritrea (see annex). This statement not only responds to Ethiopia's false allegations, but also exposes Ethiopia's gross human rights abuses, which it has perpetrated and continues to perpetrate with impunity, on the people of Eritrea and Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean origin over the past two years. I should be grateful if you would kindly circulate the present letter and its annex as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda items 116 (a) and (d), and of the Security Council. (Signed) Haile Menkerios Ambassador Permanent Representative
