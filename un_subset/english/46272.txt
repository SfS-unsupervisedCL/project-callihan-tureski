CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT 1833 25 January 2008 ENGLISH Original: ENGLISH and RUSSIAN LETTER DATED 19 DECEMBER 2007 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO THE CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE CONFERENCE TRANSMITTING THE TEXT OF THE JOINT STATEMENT ON THE TREATY ON THE ELIMINATION OF INTERMEDIATE-RANGE AND SHORTER-RANGE MISSILES, ISSUED ON 25 OCTOBER 2007 We have the honour to transmit herewith the Russian and English texts of the Joint Statement on the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, issued on 25 October 2007 by the Russian Federation and the United States of America. We would be grateful if the present letter and the text of the Joint Statement could be issued and circulated as official documents of the Conference on Disarmament.

Rocca Ambassador Ambassador Permanent Representative of the Permanent Representative Russian Federation to the of the United States of America Conference on Disarmament to the Conference on Disarmament on the Treaty on the Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles at the sixty-second session of the General Assembly December 8, 2007 marks the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, which banned ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres. It is hard to overestimate the historic significance of this act: it marked an important, practical step in meeting our NPT article VI obligation to pursue negotiations in good faith on nuclear disarmament. By late 1991, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States destroyed all missiles of these two classes along with all supporting infrastructure under strict verification procedures. We would like to underscore the contribution of this Treaty to decreased international tensions, particularly in Europe. The Russian Federation and the United States take this occasion to reaffirm our joint support for the INF Treaty. We are concerned with the proliferation of intermediate- and shorter-range missiles. An ever-greater number of countries are acquiring missile production technologies and adding such missiles to their arsenals. At the same time, the Treaty, being of unlimited duration, is limiting the actions only of a few States, primarily Russia and the United States. The Russian Federation and the United States call on all interested countries to discuss the possibility of imparting a global character to this important regime through the renunciation of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres, leading to destruction of any such missiles and the cessation of associated programmes. Such a renunciation would serve to strengthen the international nuclear missile non-proliferation effort. Today the Treaty retains its long-standing importance. We believe that renunciation of ground-launched intermediate- and shorter-range missiles and their complete elimination in the world would increase the role of the Treaty as a model for strengthening international security. The Russian Federation and the United States will work with all interested countries and continue to make every effort to prevent the proliferation of such missiles and strengthen peace in the world.
