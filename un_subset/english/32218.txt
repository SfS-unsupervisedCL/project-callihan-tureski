Takes note of the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the World Health Organization, and calls for support for the recommendations contained therein; 2. Welcomes the increased funding for malaria interventions and for research and development of preventative and control tools from the international community, including from the Group of Eight, the United States of America, the World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as the European Commission and other sources of bilateral funding; 3. Calls upon the international community to continue to support the "Roll Back Malaria" partner organizations, including the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, as vital complementary sources of support for the efforts of malaria-endemic countries to combat the disease; 4. Appeals to the international community to work towards increased and sustained bilateral and multilateral assistance to combat malaria, including support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, in order to assist States, in particular malaria-endemic countries, to implement sound national plans to control malaria in a sustained and equitable way that, inter alia, contributes to health system development; 5. Urges malaria-endemic countries to work towards financial sustainability, to increase, to the extent possible, domestic resource allocation to malaria control and to create favourable conditions for working with the private sector in order to improve access to good-quality malaria services; 6. Calls upon Member States, in particular malaria-endemic countries, to establish and/or strengthen national policies and operational plans, aspiring to ensure that at least 80 per cent of those at risk of or suffering from malaria may benefit from major preventive and curative interventions by 2010, in accordance with the technical recommendations of the World Health Organization, so as to ensure a reduction in the burden of malaria by at least 50 per cent by 2010 and 75 per cent by 2015; 7. Urges Member States to assess and respond to the needs for integrated human resources at all levels of the health system, in order to achieve the targets of the Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa and the internationally agreed development goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration,2 and to take actions, as appropriate, to effectively govern the recruitment, training and retention of health personnel; 8. Calls upon the international community, inter alia, by helping to meet the financial needs of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and through country-led initiatives with adequate international support, to create conditions for full access to insecticide-treated mosquito nets, insecticides for indoor residual spraying for malaria control and effective antimalarial combination treatments, including through the free distribution of such nets where appropriate; 9. Requests relevant international organizations, in particular the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, to assist efforts of national Governments to establish universal protection of young children and pregnant women in malaria-endemic countries, particularly in Africa, with insecticide-treated nets as rapidly as possible, with due regard to ensuring sustainability through full community participation and implementation through the health system; 10. Encourages all African countries that have not yet done so to implement the recommendations of the Abuja Summit3 to reduce or waive taxes and tariffs for nets and other products needed for malaria control, both to reduce the price of nets to consumers and to stimulate free trade in insecticide-treated nets; 11. Expresses its concern about the increase in resistant strains of malaria in several regions of the world; 12. Encourages all Member States experiencing resistance to conventional monotherapies to replace them with combination therapies, as recommended by the World Health Organization, in a timely manner; 13. Recognizes the importance of the development of effective vaccines and new medicines to prevent and treat malaria and the need for further and accelerated research, including by providing support to the United Nations Children's Fund/United Nations Development Programme/World Bank/World Health Organization Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases and through effective global partnerships such as the various malaria vaccine initiatives and the Medicines for Malaria Venture, where necessary stimulated by new incentives to secure their development; 14. Calls upon the international community to support investment in the development of new medicines to prevent and treat malaria, especially for children and pregnant women, sensitive and specific diagnostic tests, effective vaccines, and new insecticides and delivery modes in order to enhance effectiveness and delay the onset of resistance, including through existing partnerships; 15. Also calls upon the international community to support ways to expand access to artemisinin-based combination therapy for populations at risk of exposure to resistant strains of falciparum malaria in Africa, including the commitment of new funds, innovative mechanisms for the financing and national procurement of artemisinin-based combination therapy and the scaling up of artemisinin production to meet the increased need; 16.
