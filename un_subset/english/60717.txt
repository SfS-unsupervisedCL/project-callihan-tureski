the relevant Security Council resolutions, Emphasizing the importance attached by the international community of all parties engaging fully, flexibly and constructively in the negotiations, echoing

in Cyprus, and urging rapid agreement on facilitating the recommencement of demining operations and clearance of the remaining minefields, Welcoming the progress and continuation of the important
