Letter dated 19 May 2000 from the Permanent Representative of Portugal to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to bring to your attention a statement concerning the seizure of Studio B by the Serbian Government issued on 18 May 2000 by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the text of this letter and its annex circulated as a Security Council document. (Signed) Ant√≥nio Monteiro Permanent Representative of Portugal to the United Nations [Original: English and French] Statement concerning the seizure of Studio B by the Serbian Government, issued on 18 May 2000 by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union The European Union Presidency is dismayed by the Serbian Government's intensification of repressive action against the media, opposition forces and civil society. The European Union Presidency strongly condemns the seizure of the premises of the television station Studio B on Wednesday, 17 May 2000. This seizure also impedes the work of Radio B292, Radio Index and the newspaper Blic, leaving the citizens of Belgrade with no access to independent electronic media. The European Union Presidency expresses its full support for the independent media, their journalists and employees and encourages them to continue their important task. Reporting freely and independently in Serbia is an act of democracy and public service. In contrast, the Serbian Government's flagrant measures to block free media constitute an unacceptable denial of the right to freedom of expression and clearly demonstrate the wishes of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to continue the path towards total isolation, despite the democratic aspirations of the Serbian people. The European Union Presidency urges the Serbian Government to reverse its decision to control Studio B and to enable Radio B292, Radio Index and Blic to continue their work.
