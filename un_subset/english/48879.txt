Reaffirms that the Commission for Social Development continues to have the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the World Summit for Social Development and the outcome of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly and that it serves as the main United Nations forum for an intensified global dialogue on social development issues, and calls upon Member States, the relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system and civil society to enhance their support for its work; "5. Expresses deep concern that the world financial and economic crisis, world food and energy crisis, and continuing food insecurity, and climate change, as well as the lack of results so far in the multilateral trade negotiations and a loss of confidence in the international economic system, have negative implications for social development, in particular for the achievement of poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all, and social integration; "6. Recognizes that poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration are interrelated, and mutually reinforcing, and that an enabling environment therefore needs to be created so that all three objectives can be pursued simultaneously; "7. Also recognizes that the broad concept of social development affirmed by the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly has been weakened in national and international policymaking and that, while poverty eradication is a central part of development policy and discourse, further attention should be given to the other commitments agreed to at the Summit, in particular those concerning employment and social integration, which have also suffered from a general disconnect between economic and social policymaking; "8.

Also emphasizes that poverty eradication policies should attack poverty by addressing its root and structural causes and manifestations, and that equity and the reduction of inequalities need to be incorporated in those policies; "12. Stresses that an enabling environment is a critical precondition for achieving equity and social development and that, while economic growth is essential, entrenched inequality and marginalization are an obstacle to the broad-based and sustained growth required for sustainable, inclusive, people-centred development, and recognizes the need to balance and ensure complementarity between measures to achieve growth and measures to achieve economic and social equity in order for there to be an impact on overall poverty levels; "13.

Recognizes that promoting full employment and decent work also requires investing in education, training and skills development for women and men, and girls and boys, strengthening social protection and health systems and applying labour standards; "24. Also recognizes that full and productive employment and decent work for all, which encompass social protection, fundamental principles and rights at work and social dialogue, are key elements of sustainable development for all countries and are therefore a priority objective of international cooperation; "25.

Requests the United Nations funds, programmes and agencies and invites financial institutions to support efforts to mainstream the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all in their policies, programmes and activities; 23. Recognizes that promoting full employment and decent work also requires investing in education, training and skills development for women and men, and girls and boys, strengthening social protection and health systems and applying international labour standards; 24. Also recognizes that full and productive employment and decent work for all, which encompass social protection, fundamental principles and rights at work, tripartism and social dialogue, are key elements of sustainable development for all countries and are therefore a priority objective of international cooperation; 25.
