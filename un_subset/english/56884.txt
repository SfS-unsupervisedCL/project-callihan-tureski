UNITED NATIONS EP UNEP/OzL.Pro.22/3* * Reissued for technical reasons on 6 October 2010. United Nations Environment Programme Distr.: General 9 July 2010 Original: English Twenty-Second Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer Bangkok, 8 - 12 November 2010 Item 10 of the provisional agenda for the high-level segment** Adoption of decisions by the TwentySecond Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol Draft decisions for the consideration of the Twenty-Second Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol Note by the secretariat Chapter I of the present note sets out draft decisions developed by parties and contact groups comprising parties during the thirtieth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The Working Group did not reach consensus on these draft decisions but did agree that they should be considered by the Twenty-Second Meeting of the Parties. The Working Group also agreed that further work could be undertaken intersessionally on several of the draft decisions. Consequently, it is likely that additional iterations of some of the proposals will be prepared before the Twenty-Second Meeting of the Parties. To ensure that parties are able to consider the most uptodate versions of the draft decisions the Ozone Secretariat will post on its website any updated texts that it receives. If necessary it will also issue an addendum to the present note prior to the Twenty-Second Meeting of the Parties setting forth any such texts. Chapter II of the present note contains draft decisions prepared by the Secretariat pertaining to administrative matters related to the Montreal Protocol. The parties have historically adopted decisions on such matters at their annual meetings. The proposed amendments to the Montreal Protocol that were submitted by the Federated States of Micronesia, and Canada, Mexico and the United States of America pursuant to Article 9 of the Vienna Convention and paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the Montreal Protocol can be found in documents UNEP/OzL.Pro.22/6 and UNEP/OzL.Pro.22/5, respectively.

Annex to decision XXII/C- Terms of reference for an evaluation of the financial mechanism of the Montreal Protocol A. Preamble 1. The achievements of the financial mechanism of the Montreal Protocol have often been recognized by the international community, and there is no doubt that the mechanism is both a cornerstone of the Protocol and an outstanding example of multilateral cooperation. Indeed, by the end of 2008 the Multilateral Fund had approved projects to phase out the consumption and production of about 478,000 ozonedepletingpotential (ODP) tonnes of ozone-depleting substances in developing countries, and over 85 per cent of this amount had already been phased out. As a result of those activities, nearly all parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol are in compliance with their obligations under the Protocol, while most of their consumption and production of ozone-depleting substances, except for HCFCs, has been eliminated. 2. The financial mechanism was established by Article 10 of the Montreal Protocol to provide financial and technical cooperation to parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 to enable their compliance with the Protocol's control measures. The Fourth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol recognized the need to review periodically the operation of the financial mechanism to ensure maximum effectiveness in pursuing the goals of the Montreal Protocol. Since its inception in 1991, the mechanism, which includes the Multilateral Fund, an Executive Committee, a Secretariat and implementing and bilateral agencies, has been evaluated twice by the parties, in 1994 - 1995 and 20032004. 3. The year 2010 is a landmark year in the history of both the Montreal Protocol and the financial mechanism, as virtually all remaining production and consumption of CFCs, halons and carbon tetrachloride is to be phased out by 1 January 2010. In the light of this major milestone, it is particularly timely for the parties to the Protocol to take a retrospective look at the achievements of the financial mechanism, the challenges that it has faced, the manner in which they have been addressed and the lessons that have been learned, with a view to ensuring that the mechanism is well placed to address the challenges of the future effectively. Those challenges include phasing out HCFCs and the remaining consumption of methyl bromide, implementing ozone-depleting substance destruction pilot projects and, in the future, may also include a phase-down of HFCs, should the international community decide to include HFCs under the Montreal Protocol. B. Purpose 4. In the light of the above, and considering that it has been more than five years since the last evaluation was conducted, the [Twenty-Second Meeting of the Parties] decided that it was appropriate to evaluate and review the Financial Mechanism with a view to ensuring its effective functioning in meeting the needs of parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and parties not so operating in accordance with Article 10 of the Protocol. The study should be based on the present terms of reference, carried out by an independent consultant and completed by May 2012, in time for consideration by the Openended Working Group of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol at its thirtysecond meeting. C. Scope 5. In carrying out the study, the consultant should consider the results, policy framework, organizational structure and lessons learned associated with the financial mechanism as follows: (a) Results of the financial mechanism: Extent to which both investment and non-investment projects approved under the Multilateral Fund have contributed to phasing out ozone-depleting substances in parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 in accordance with Montreal Protocol compliance targets; Total reductions of ozone-depleting substances in ODP-tonnes and metric tonnes resulting from Multilateral Fund activities; [Total reductions [and introduction of] greenhouse gases in carbon dioxide equivalent terms resulting from Multilateral Fund activities and production capacity installed]; Comparison of planned ozone-depleting substance phase-out and ozonedepleting substance phase-out achieved; Comparison of planned cost-effectiveness of projects and cost-effectiveness achieved; [Comparison of approved incremental costs and actual [incremental] costs of selected samples of completed projects]; Comparison of planned project implementation time and implementation time achieved; [Identification of any incidental results of Multilateral Fund activities, including environmental co-benefits, not directly related to the reduction of ozonedepleting substances [or greenhouse gases]]; Efficacy of provided capacity-building and institutional strengthening and compliance assistance; [Comparison of substitutes and alternatives funded by the Multilateral Fund in respect of their environmental impacts mentioned in paragraph 11 of decision XIX/6;] (b) Policies and procedures: Effectiveness and efficiency of procedures and practices to develop and approve projects under the Multilateral Fund; Coherence and effectiveness of the project review process; Adequacy of planning and implementation process of projects and activities to ensure compliance; Effectiveness and efficiency of monitoring and reporting procedures and practices; Adequacy of internal evaluation and verification mechanisms to monitor and confirm results, including an analysis of existing databases; Extent to which policies and procedures are adapted or improved based on experiences and relevant circumstances; (c) Organizational structure: Adequacy and effectiveness of the division of labour between] the Executive Committee, the Secretariat, the evaluation function, the Treasurer and the implementing and bilateral agencies; Adequacy and effectiveness of interaction between the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund and the Meeting of the Parties and related subsidiary bodies; Review of the role and guidance provided by parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 in the project development and implementation process; Adequacy and effectiveness of timing between meetings, submission deadlines and reporting deadlines; (d) Multilateral and bilateral implementing agencies: Examination of accountability mechanisms applicable to the agencies; Identification of any bottlenecks, gaps and overlaps in the operation of the agencies; Adequacy of the administrative cost regime; (e) Other issues: Review of the distribution of funding among regions where parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 are located, as well as between lowvolume consuming countries and non-low-volume consuming countries; Identification of the countries of origin of the technology and the related inputs (chemicals, spare parts, etc) provided through a representative sample of investment projects, and consideration of the possible dependency of beneficiary enterprises on those countries for the continued operation of such technology; Review of local and international consultant and technology costs in a representative sample of investment and non-investment projects and respective shares of those costs in relation to total project costs; Proportion of administrative costs including Secretariat and implementing agency costs in terms of total resources; Experience and effectiveness of the transfer of technology; (f) Lessons learned: Lessons learned in view of the future challenges of the Montreal Protocol and the Multilateral Fund; Lessons learned for other international environmental institutions and agreements.

Draft decision XXII/[M]: Phase-out of HFC-23 as a by-product of HCFC-22 production Recalling decision X/16, which recognizes the importance of implementing the Montreal Protocol and takes note of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons as replacements for ozonedepleting substances that have potentially substantial impacts on the climate system, Noting with appreciation the special report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, "Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System: Issues Related to Hydrofluorocarbons and Perfluorocarbons", Recalling decision XVIII/12, by which the Ozone Secretariat was requested to facilitate consultations between the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and relevant organizations aimed at drawing on the work already carried out under these organizations, including work relating to HCFC22, Recalling also the report prepared by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel pursuant to decision XVIII/12, in particular the chapter on the role of the Clean Development Mechanism with respect to HFC-23 by-product emissions resulting from the production of HCFC-22, Mindful that Parties not operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol are obligated to freeze production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons by 2004 and phase out consumption by 2030 and that Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 are obligated to freeze production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons by 2016 and phase out consumption by 2040, Recognizing the unique relationship of HFC-23 to the controlled substance HCFC-22, given that the production of HCFC-22 results in emissions of HFC-23 as a byproduct and that the production of HCFC-22 for feedstock uses is expected to continue beyond the phase-out of production for controlled uses under the Montreal Protocol, Recognizing also the opportunity to facilitate an environmentally responsible approach to managing the production of HCFC-22 for both controlled and feedstock uses, Acknowledging that emissions of HFC-23 are covered by the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and that actions taken under the present decision are not intended to affect that coverage, Emphasizing the potential implications of projects in HCFC-22 production facilities funded through the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism and that the value of Clean Development Mechanism credits may exceed 50 times the cost of mitigating HFC-23 emissions; Recognizing the need for immediate action to prevent uncontrolled HFC-23 by-product emissions from harming the climate system, particularly in the light of the control measure that will take effect on 1 January 2014 in accordance with the amendment by which the Meeting of the Parties subjected hydrofluorocarbons to the Montreal Protocol, To request the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol to review and update information presented in the report by the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund on HCFC-22 production facilities located in parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5, including information on the location of such facilities, their production capacity, the production capacity of each individual production line and whether it is the subject of an existing project under the Clean Development Mechanism to limit or destroy HFC-23 ands the end date of any such project; To request the Executive Committee also to present the findings of the study referred to in the preceding paragraph at the thirty-first meeting of the Open-ended Working Group; To request the Executive Committee further to develop estimates of the incremental costs, including capital costs and operational costs, associated with the collection and destruction of HFC-23 by-product emissions from HCFC-22 production in facilities located in parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5; To request the Executive Committee to formulate guidelines for funding projects to collect and destroy by-product emissions of HFC-23 during the production of HCFC-22, including production for feedstock, by the sixty-fourth meeting of the Executive Committee; To request the Executive Committee also, as a matter of urgency, to facilitate the formulation and implementation of projects to eliminate byproduct emissions of HFC-23 during the production of HCFC-22 for facilities or production lines that are not collecting emissions reduction credits under the Clean Development Mechanism; To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel, in consultation with the Scientific Assessment Panel, to conduct a study of the potential costs and environmental benefits HFC23 by-product control measures in the production of HCFC22, by facility or production line, excluding the costs and benefits associated with existing Clean Development Mechanism projects when relevant, and to prepare a report in time to distribute it 60 days before the thirty-first meeting of the Open-ended Working Group, to assist the Parties in further considering the issues relating to HFC-23 emitted as a by-product of the HCFC-22 production.]. N. Draft decision XXII/[N]: Quarantine and pre-shipment uses Submission by the contact group on quarantine and pre-shipment uses established at the thirtieth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group [Noting that, according to the assessment of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel's Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee, a reduction [of 18 - 27 per cent] of the global consumption of methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment uses could be achieved by replacing [approximately 1,937 - 2,942 tonnes of] methyl bromide used in the four main categories of such uses with currently available technologies, Recalling decision X/11, requesting parties to submit to the Ozone Secretariat a list of regulations that mandate the use of methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment treatments, and decision XI/13, requesting parties to review their national regulations with a view to removing any requirement that methyl bromide be used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications where technically and economically feasible alternatives exist, Noting the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel's conclusion that the parties' definitions of quarantine and pre-shipment applications [in decisions VII/5 and XI/12] are not being applied consistently in some areas, resulting in a significant volume of methyl bromide being inappropriately classified as being used for quarantine purposes for pre-plant soil treatment, Reminding parties of their obligation to report annual data on the consumption of methyl bromide for quarantine and pre-shipment uses under Article 7 of the Protocol and to establish and implement a system for licensing trade in methyl bromide, including methyl bromide used for quarantine and preshipment purposes, under Article 4 [, as recalled in decision XXI/10], Reminding also parties of their outstanding tasks agreed upon in decisions XX/6 and XXI/10, notably the establishment and submission of national strategies to reduce the use of methyl bromide for phytosanitary measures and/or reduce emissions, 1. To request [both importing and exporting] parties to review their national sanitary, phytosanitary, environmental and stored product regulations that mandate the use of methyl bromide with a view to allowing the use of alternative treatments or procedures that provide an appropriate level of phytosanitary protection, consistent with the standards and guidelines promulgated under the International Plant Protection Convention, [taking into account alternatives that have been identified by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel,] [and to avoid imposing any obligation to treat consignments with methyl bromide both before shipment and upon arrival]; [2. To urge parties to classify as quarantine and preshipment uses of methyl bromide only those uses that are consistent with the definitions of quarantine and pre-shipment applications agreed upon by the parties in decisions VII/5 and XI/12;] [3. To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee, in consultation with other relevant experts and the secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention, to provide for consideration by the Openended Working Group at its thirty-first meeting a report that includes: (a) An assessment, as referred to in paragraph 3 (4) of decision XXI/10, applying the methodology provided [by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and its Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee] [in the annex to the present decision] of: (i) The technical and economical feasibility of alternatives to methyl bromide treatments of sawn timber and wood packaging material, grains and similar foodstuffs and logs and alternatives to pre-plant soil uses qualifying as quarantine measures; (ii) The impact of the implementation of the alternatives referred to in the preceding subparagraph; (iii) The impact of restricting the quantity of methyl bromide production and consumption for all quarantine and pre-shipment uses; (b) [to be completed to address concerns of other parties];] [4. To request all parties to gather the best possible data about the sectors in which methyl bromide is used for quarantine and pre-shipment purposes and to provide that data to the Ozone Secretariat by January 2012;] [5. To request the Ozone Secretariat to review, in view of their completeness and consistency, the Article 7 reports and other data provided by parties in response to past decisions of the Meeting of the Parties on methyl bromide production, consumption and uses for quarantine and preshipment applications for the years 2005 and later, and to request relevant parties to provide additional data or clarifications where appropriate.]] O. Draft decision XXII/[O]: Situation of Haiti Submission by Grenada and Saint Lucia Noting with appreciation the efforts and commitment made by the Government of Haiti to sustain compliance with the Montreal Protocol, Recognizing the extraordinary difficulties now faced by Haiti as a result of the devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake that occurred on 12 January 2010, which has had adverse effects on the economic and social welfare of the people of Haiti, Understanding Haiti's commitment to meeting its obligations in respect of phasing out ozonedepleting substances under the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, 1. To urge all parties to assist Haiti by controlling the export of ozonedepleting substances and technologies dependent on ozone-depleting substances to Haiti through the control of trade in accordance with decision X/9 of the Tenth Meeting of the Parties and other relevant decisions; 2. To request the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, when considering project proposals for Haiti, to take into account the special situation of Haiti and the special difficulties that it may pose in respect of the phase-out of ozonedepleting substances, including in particular the accelerated phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, in accordance with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol; 3. Also to request the Executive Committee to ensure that appropriate assistance is provided to Haiti in the areas of institutional strengthening, capacity-building, data collection and monitoring and control of trade in ozone-depleting substances, along with any other assistance that may be deemed necessary; 4. Further to request the Executive Committee to ensure that appropriate assistance is provided for the development of a strategy to achieve the reorganization of Haiti's national ozone unit and in the continuation of its efforts to report to the Ozone Secretariat data on consumption of ozonedepleting substances in accordance with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol; 5. That all determinations made by the Implementation Committee under the NonCompliance Procedure for the Montreal Protocol should be considered in the light of the difficulties faced by Haiti as a result of the earthquake. P. Draft decision XXII/[P]: Treatment of stockpiled ozonedepleting substances Recalling that in decision XVIII/17 the Secretariat was requested to maintain a consolidated record of the cases in which parties had explained that their excess production and consumption of ozonedepleting substances in a given year were a consequence of the production or import of ozonedepleting substances in that year that had been stockpiled for some specified purposes in a future year, Recalling also that the Secretariat was also requested to incorporate that record in the documentation prepared for each meeting of the Implementation Committee, for information purposes only, as well as in the Secretariat's report on data submitted by the Parties in accordance with Article 7 of the Protocol, Noting that the Secretariat has reported 29 cases since 1999 involving 12 parties that have exceeded the allowed level of production or consumption of a particular ozone-depleting substance in a given year and explained that their excess production or consumption resulted from one of the scenarios mentioned above, To request parties, when reporting data under Article 7 of the Protocol, to identify any excess production and consumption that is a consequence of ozone-depleting substance production in the reporting year that was stockpiled: For domestic destruction or export for destruction in a future year; For domestic feedstock use or export for that use in a future year; For export to meet basic domestic needs of developing countries in a future year; To request parties having reported cases covered in paragraph 1 above to identify for each case, when reporting data under Article 7 of the Protocol, the final use of the stockpiled ozonedepleting substances and when it took place; To remind all parties to report all production of ozone-depleting substances, whether intended or unintended, to enable the calculation of their production and consumption according to Article 3 of the Protocol; To request the Secretariat, in consultation with the Implementation Committee, to update and review the forms and tools for reporting data under Article 7 of the Protocol for consideration by the Twenty-Third Meeting of the Parties to enable the Meeting of the Parties: To establish a reporting framework to account for limited stockpiles related to the cases listed in paragraph 1 above; To ensure that the resulting reporting framework allows such stockpiles to be tracked and reconciled with their intended uses in the following years; To simplify and update the reporting tools taking into account all possible uses of the substances and possible suggestions by the Parties; To request the Secretariat to bring forward to the Implementation Committee for further consideration any case: Of excess production or consumption that is not covered by the scenarios listed in paragraph 1 above; In which the final use of stockpiled ozone-depleting substances has not been reported in the year following the year in which it was reported as stockpiled production; In which stockpiled ozone-depleting substances have not been used for one of the uses listed in paragraph 1 above in the year following the year in which they were reported as stockpiled production.
