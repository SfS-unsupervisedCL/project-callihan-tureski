UNITED NATIONS E Economic and Social Council Distr. Original: COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS Fifty-ninth session Agenda item 8 QUESTION OF THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE OCCUPIED ARAB TERRITORIES, INCLUDING PALESTINE Letter dated 9 April 2003 from the Permanent Observer for Palestine to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed to the Chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights The Israeli Government continues to wage its brutal military war against the Palestinian people, causing more martyrs, permanently handicapped, wounded and vast destruction, and increasing the extent of human suffering throughout the occupied Palestinian territory. Yesterday, Tuesday, 8 April 2003, the Israeli occupation forces carried out a new assassination operation in Gaza. To fulfil this mission, the Israeli occupation forces, backed by F16 fighter jets and Apache helicopters, made a military incursion into the most densely populated residential area in the Gaza Strip, "Hay Askoula", and shelled with missiles innocent civilians in a manner which affirms once again the intention of the Government of Israel to cause a maximum number of victims among innocent Palestinian civilians, massacring 7 of them and wounding over 45 others, including children, some of whom sustained severe wounds and are in a serious condition. With complete disregard and contempt for international law, including international humanitarian law, the Israeli occupation forces continue to deliberately kill, raid, destroy, abduct, detain and impose severe collective punishments on the civilian population under occupation, deepening the already dire humanitarian crisis. War crimes, State terrorism and systematic human rights violations continue to be committed by the Israeli occupation forces on a daily basis. GE.03-12977 (E) 110403 This new massacre in the most densely populated area of the Gaza Strip serves to affirm once again the firm policy of the Government of Israel and its occupation forces in the occupied Palestinian territories of systematic killing of Palestinian civilians and home demolitions on the very heads of their inhabitants, as was the case during this last massacre and all previous Israeli massacres. That the systematic and permanent acts of mass killing targeting Palestinian civilians, not only since September 2000, but since the conception of Israel and since its occupation of the Palestinian territory in 1967, have not faced any deterrent or punitive measures from the international community was and still constitutes a factor encouraging the Government of Israel to persist in perpetrating all forms of crime against the Palestinian people, in flagrant violation of human rights, in total disregard for the principles of international law, international humanitarian law and the two International Covenants on Human Rights, and also in total violation of the resolutions calling on Israel immediately to put an end to these violations adopted by the Commission on Human Rights for over 10 years now, all of which have been met with total disregard, contempt and disdain on the part of the Government of Israel. Herewith enclosed is a sample of the everyday life the whole Palestinian people is exposed to on a daily basis due to the daily aggressions at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces and settlers. I would be most grateful if you could arrange to have this letter* distributed to the members of the Commission on Human Rights, as an official document of the fifty-ninth session of the Commission under its agenda item 8.
