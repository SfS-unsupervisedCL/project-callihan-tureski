Statement by the President of the Security Council At the 6965th meeting of the Security Council, held on 13 May 2013, in connection with the Council's consideration of the item entitled "Peace and security in Africa", the President of the Security Council made the following statement on behalf of the Council: "The Security Council reaffirms its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. "The Security Council notes with deep concern that terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to international peace and security, the enjoyment of human rights and social and economic development of States, and undermines global stability and prosperity in Africa, in particular that this threat has become more diffuse, with an increase, in various regions of the world, of terrorist acts including those motivated by intolerance and extremism. "The Security Council recalls all its resolutions and statements on counter terrorism, reiterates its strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes, and expresses its determination to combat by all means terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, including applicable international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. "The Security Council is deeply concerned by the increasing violence perpetrated by armed groups, the number of which is growing in several regions and sub-regions of Africa. The Security Council is all the more concerned as the States in these regions are faced with difficulties such as porous borders which continue to pose challenges to border control, and the increasing illegal trafficking of arms; these States furthermore face difficult socioeconomic situations, which result in a lack of means and resources to effectively combat terrorism. The Council recognizes the importance of strong and effective national, sub-regional and regional institutions in this regard. "The Security Council recognizes that terrorism will not be defeated by military force or security forces, law enforcement measures, and intelligence operations alone, and underlines the need to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, including, but not limited to, strengthening efforts for the successful prevention and peaceful resolution of prolonged conflicts, and also promoting the rule of law, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, good governance, tolerance and inclusiveness. "The Security Council underscores that the long term fight against terrorism must adopt a comprehensive approach by dealing with the challenges of increasing economic growth, promoting good governance, reducing poverty, building state capacity, extending social services and fighting corruption, particularly in Africa, but also in other regions. "The Security Council reaffirms that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality or civilization. "The Security Council also reaffirms that Member States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, and shall also give the United Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and shall refrain from giving assistance to any State against which the United Nations is taking preventive or enforcement action. "The Security Council notes with concern that terrorist threats jeopardize the security of the countries in the sub-regions concerned and, consequently, of the entire continent, and negatively impact the efforts by African States to promote social and economic development. The Security Council recognizes that development and security are mutually reinforcing and are vital to an effective and comprehensive approach to countering terrorism. "The Security Council notes the changing nature and character of terrorism in Africa, expresses its concern regarding the connection, in many cases, between terrorism and transnational organized crime and illicit activities such as drugs, arms and human trafficking and emphasizes the need to enhance coordination of efforts on national, sub-regional, regional and international levels in order to strengthen a global response to this serious challenge and threat to international peace and security. "The Security Council recalls resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011), 1373 (2001), 1540 (2004) and 1624 (2005), as well as other applicable international counter-terrorism instruments, stresses the need for their full implementation, renews its call on States to consider becoming parties as soon as possible to all relevant international conventions and protocols, and to fully implement their obligations under those to which they are party, and notes the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee established pursuant GA resolution 51/210, noting that more time was required to achieve substantive progress on the outstanding issues, and deciding to recommend that the Sixth Committee, at its sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, establish a working group with a view to finalizing the process on the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. "The Security Council considers sanctions an important tool in countering terrorism, and underlines the importance of prompt and effective implementation of the relevant resolutions, in particular, Security Council resolution 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) as key instrument in the fight against terrorism. The Security Council reiterates its continued commitment to ensure that fair and clear procedures exist for placing individuals and entities on sanctions lists and for removing them, as well as for granting humanitarian exemptions. "The Security Council reiterates the need to increase ongoing cooperation among committees with counter-terrorism mandates established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011), 1988 (2011), 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004) and their respective groups of experts. "The Security Council reiterates its readiness to impose sanctions on individuals and entities who harbour, finance, facilitate, support, organize, train, or incite individuals or groups to perpetrate acts of violence or terrorist acts against other States or their citizens in Somalia or its region in accordance with its relevant resolutions, and other regional networks as well as individuals, groups, undertakings and entities who do not cut off all ties to Al Qaida and associated groups, including Al Qaida in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI), "Mouvement pour l'Unicit√© et le Jihad en Afrique de l'Ouest" (MUJAO) and Ansar Eddine, in accordance with resolution 2083 (2012). "The Security Council notes that the relevant instruments of the African Union (AU) on the prevention of and the fight against terrorism, in particular, the 1999 Algiers Convention on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism and its Additional Protocol, and the Plan of Action on the Prevention of Terrorism, and welcomes the steps taken by African States at the national and regional levels to combat terrorism. "The Council, taking note of the AU's decision in its December 8, 2011 communique, strongly condemns the incidents of kidnapping and hostage-taking with the aim of raising funds or gaining political concessions, notes the increase in such kidnappings in the Sahel region, and underscores the urgent need to address these issues.

"The Security Council reiterates the obligation of Member States to refrain, consistent with international law, from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in or associated with terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups, and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists; and recognizes the need to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism and terrorist organizations, including from the proceeds of illicit activities, such as organized crime, the trafficking and illicit production of narcotic drugs and their chemical precursors, and the importance of continued international cooperation towards that aim. "The Security Council acknowledges the important work of the United Nations entities and other multilateral organizations in supporting efforts to prevent and suppress the financing of terrorism and terrorist organisations, in particular the Financial Action Task Force, the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG), the Inter Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA), and the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force in promoting capacity and cooperation (MENAFATF). "The Security Council emphasizes that continuing international efforts to enhance dialogue and broaden understanding among civilizations in an effort to prevent the indiscriminate targeting of different religions and cultures, and addressing unresolved regional conflicts and the full range of global issues, including development issues, will contribute to strengthening the international fight against terrorism. "The Security Council reaffirms the need for African States to work closely and directly through the relevant bodies of the African Union and other regional frameworks for the implementation of enhanced measures for cooperation, mutual assistance and coordination between security agencies, prosecutors and judges, with a view to making the collective endeavours of Africa more effective, and specifically, more proactive, in combating terrorism, and emphasizes the need to take all necessary and appropriate measures in accordance with international law, to include protections for the right to life and other human rights in Africa. "The Security Council is concerned about extremism and the incitement of terrorism in African States and emphasizes the importance of countering violent extremism in the fight against terrorism, including by addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, and building community resilience to resist incitement by promoting tolerance, diversity, respect and dialogue. "The Security Council recognizes the support provided by bilateral and multilateral actors, including the African Union (AU), the European Union (EU), the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the League of Arab States (LAS) and sub regional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Community of Sahelo Saharan States (CENSAD), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) to efforts aimed at combating terrorism in Africa and calls on the international community and the United Nations system to strengthen their cooperation with the counter-terrorism sub-regional bodies such as the African Centre for Studies and Research on Terrorism (CAERT).

"The Security Council urges Sahel and Maghreb States to enhance interregional cooperation and coordination in order to develop inclusive and effective strategies to combat in a comprehensive and integrated manner the activities of terrorist groups, namely Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), "Mouvement pour l'Unicit√© et le Jihad en Afrique de l'Ouest" (MUJAO), and Ansar Eddine, and prevent the expansion of those groups as well as to suppress the proliferation of all arms and fight transnational organized crime, including drug trafficking and, in this regard, takes note of the outcome of the Conference organized by CTED and CTITF in Rabat on the Cooperation on Border Control in the Sahel and the Maghreb, as well as the outcome of the ministerial meeting on the enhancement of cooperation in security and the operationalisation of the African Peace and Security Architecture in the Sahelo-Saharian region held in Nouakchott.
