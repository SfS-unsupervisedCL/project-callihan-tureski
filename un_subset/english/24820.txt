* Reissued for technical reasons. Letter dated 8 May 2003 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to refer to my letter of 16 April 2003 (S/2003/431), under cover of which I forwarded for the consideration of the members of the Security Council a letter dated 26 March 2003 from the President of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, Judge Navanethem Pillay. In her letter, President Pillay requested extensions of the terms of office of four non-elected permanent Judges of the International Tribunal for Rwanda in order to allow them to dispose of a number of ongoing cases. I also have the honour to refer to the letter dated 30 April 2003 (S/2003/550) of the former President of the Security Council, Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, in which he asked me to convey to President Pillay the views of the members of the Security Council on the requests contained in her letter. He also asked me to convey to President Pillay the request of the members of the Security Council for certain information and documentation to assist them in the further consideration of President Pillay's request. Attached for your consideration and for the consideration of the members of the Security Council is a letter, dated 6 May 2003, which President Pillay has sent to me pursuant to that request (see annex). I should be most grateful if you could bring the present letter and its annex to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Kofi A. Annan Enclosure Letter dated 6 May 2003 from the President of the International Tribunal for Rwanda addressed to the President of the Security Council In response to your letter dated 30 April 2003, addressed to the Secretary-General and conveyed to the President of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, I hereby confirm my undertaking to be fully available as a judge of the International Tribunal and not to engage in any substantive work as a judge of the International Criminal Court, during the period of time that would be required for me to complete the Media Case.
