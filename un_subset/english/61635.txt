On behalf of my Government, I strongly protest the continuing violations by Turkey of international air traffic regulations and the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus and call for their immediate cessation. Such systematic abuses by Turkey of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus blatantly violate international law and air traffic regulations and seriously compromise international aviation safety in the greater region. This is particularly disconcerting in the context of the recent military threats by Turkey against Cyprus, related to activity in my country's Exclusive Economic Zone, as well as recent statements by high-level Turkish officials threatening annexation of the occupied part of Cyprus. We would like to reiterate our call to the Government of Turkey to abide by the Charter of the United Nations and its international obligations and respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all Member States of the United Nations. The persistence of the above-mentioned violations is particularly counterproductive at the present juncture of negotiations in search of a just, lasting and peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem. In this context, we reiterate our call to the Government of Turkey to act constructively in support of efforts aimed at reaching a viable solution to the Cyprus problem, in accordance with the agreed basis for such a solution, endorsed by numerous Security Council resolutions. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 43, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Nicholas Emiliou
