Fifty-ninth session Agenda item 127 Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Revised budget for the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 Report of the Secretary-General Contents Paragraphs Page Mandate and planned results Resource requirements Analysis of variances Actions to be taken by the General Assembly Annexes I. Organization charts II. Map I. Mandate and planned results 1. The mandate of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000. By its resolution 1565 (2004) of 1 October 2004, the Security Council extended the deployment of MONUC until 31 March 2005, authorized the increase of the Mission's strength by 5,900 personnel, including up to 341 civilian police personnel, as well as the deployment of appropriate civilian personnel, appropriate and proportionate air mobility assets and other force enablers and decided that MONUC would have the mandate set out in paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of the resolution. 2. The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to maintain international peace and security in the region. 3. Within this overall objective, MONUC will, during the budget period, contribute to the expected accomplishments, which have been reviewed by the General Assembly in the context of the Mission's initial 2004/05 budget (A/58/701) and remain unchanged, by delivering related key outputs. The frameworks below are grouped by components: peace and security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; the Transitional Government and elections; rule of law; and the human dimension of sustainable peace and support. They show additional outputs to be produced with the proposed additional resources, and indicate additional contributions to the same expected accomplishments defined in the Mission's initial 2004/05 budget, which are included in the present report for ease of reference. The additional contributions can be measured through the previously formulated indicators of achievements identified as "no change", as well as additional or revised indicators of achievement. The human resources of the Mission in terms of the number of personnel have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the Mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the Mission as a whole. Additional human resource requirements compared with the initial 2004/05 budget, including redeployments and reclassifications, have been explained under the respective components. 4. The Mission is headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the Under-Secretary-General level, who is assisted by two Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, both at the Assistant Secretary-General level. Reporting directly to the Special Representative are the Force Commander, at the Assistant Secretary-General level, and the Director of Administration (D-2). The civilian police establishment of the Mission is headed by a Civilian Police Commissioner (D-1), who reports to the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General. 5. Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1565 (2004), MONUC has adjusted its military concept of operations, with force deployment concentrated in the east of the country. In order to reflect the tasks set out by the Council in paragraphs 4 and 5 of its resolution 1565 (2004), the Mission will deploy three (including two additional) brigade-size contingents, which would constitute the Eastern Division, to the Ituri region (Bunia), South Kivu (Bukavu) and North Kivu (Goma), with the divisional headquarters established in Kisangani under the command of a Divisional Commander (D-2). In addition, two battalions positioned in Kinshasa and Kisangani will act as force and divisional reserves, respectively. 6. The Mission's logistical concept of operations has also been adjusted with a view to establishing, operating and maintaining additional infrastructure and providing the necessary communications, mobility and sustainment capabilities essential to support the reconfigured deployment of the military force. The Mission headquarters will continue its operations from the capital, Kinshasa, where the Offices of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Force Commander are located. Support facilities and administrative and technical services will be provided to substantive, military and civilian police personnel from the Mission headquarters, the Kisangani divisional administrative headquarters, the 6 regional offices and 30 field locations where Mission personnel are deployed, including the significantly expanded Bunia, Bukavu and Goma offices, as well as the logistics bases in Bunia, Entebbe (Uganda), Kinshasa and Kigoma (United Republic of Tanzania). Executive direction and management 7. Overall mission direction and management are to be provided by the immediate Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General. Table 1 Human resources: executive direction and management International staff National staff United Nations Volunteers Total USG- ASG D-2- D-1 P-5- P-4 P-3- P-1 Field Service General Service Security Service Subtotal Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General Approved 2004/05a Revised 2004/05 Net change Heads of Liaison and Field Offices Approved 2004/05 a Includes offices of the Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General, Protocol Unit, Legal Affairs Section, Code of Conduct/Community Relations Office, Quick Impact Projects Unit and Mandate Planning and Tracking Unit. Justification Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General International staff: net decrease of two posts Upon careful review of experience gained and outputs produced by the Mandate Planning and Tracking Unit, and with a view to avoiding overlap with other substantive offices of the Mission, it is proposed to disband the Unit and redistribute its functions within the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and the Political Affairs Division. The posts approved for the Mandate Planning and Tracking Unit would be redeployed to strengthen the Mission's substantive offices as follows: one P-5 to the Electoral Assistance Division, one P-4 to the Rule of Law Unit and one P-3 to the Political Affairs Division (to be deployed to the Bunia field office). It is also proposed to retain one Field Service post for the position of Personal Assistant to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (the approved staffing establishment of the office includes two secretaries (General Service (Other level) posts) and does not provide for this position). In addition, in order to provide administrative support to the Protocol Unit, it is proposed to redeploy one General Service (Other level) post from the office of the Director of Administration. The approved staffing establishment of the Unit does not provide for any support staff. United Nations Volunteers: increase by four positions In view of the increased requirements for the translation of official documents and correspondence from English to French and from French to English, it is proposed to establish in the immediate Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General three United Nations Volunteer positions of Translator/Interpreter (the approved staffing establishment does not provide for these functions). In view of the increased scope of work of the Legal Affairs Section, it is proposed to establish one United Nations Volunteer position of a Legal Assistant, who would be responsible for preparing legal briefs, providing legal guidance and advice to members of Boards of Inquiry and legal support on criminal law issues. Heads of Liaison and Field Offices International staff: no change (on a net basis) Given the political and economic importance of the port city of Matadi in the Bas-Congo province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the establishment of a new field office is proposed to provide for the overall coordination of: the implementation of the Mission's mandated programmes in the region; liaison with regional officials; visits from members of the diplomatic community and leaders of political parties and civil society; coordination of work programmes of the substantive components in the region; regular reporting on mandate implementation and on relevant political and other developments to the Mission's headquarters; and provision of inputs to reports of the Secretary-General and briefings to the Security Council. The Matadi office would be headed by a Political Affairs Officer at the P-4 level. Bunia field office: upon review of the staffing establishment of the office, it is proposed to redeploy one post (P-2) to the Electoral Assistance Division. National staff: increase by two posts Bukavu and Goma field offices: in view of the expansion of the Mission activities in the east of the country and, in particular, to promote conflict resolution initiatives and the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, resettlement and reintegration of ex-combatants, it is proposed to establish one additional national General Service staff post (Interpreter/Translator) in each of the two offices. The incumbents would provide interpretation services, mainly from/into French and local languages, serve as a conduit between the substantive international staff of the offices and the local population and assist in establishing contacts with ex-combatants and vulnerable groups of population.

Office of the Force Commander Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1565 (2004), by which the Council, inter alia, authorized the increase of the Mission's strength by 5,900 personnel, including up to 341 civilian police personnel, MONUC has refined its political-military concept as described in paragraphs 30 and 31 of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council of 31 December 2004 (S/2004/1034) and adjusted the military concept of operations as set out in paragraphs 38 to 43 of the same report, with Force deployment concentrated in the east of the country. The Mission will deploy three (including two additional) brigade-size contingents, which would constitute the Eastern Division, to the Ituri region (Bunia), South Kivu (Bukavu) and North Kivu (Goma), with the divisional headquarters established in Kisangani under the command of a Division Commander (D-2). In addition, two battalions positioned in Kinshasa and Kisangani will act as force and divisional reserves, respectively. International staff: net increase by four posts In view of the increase of the authorized troop strength, and in order to implement the tasks set out by the Security Council in paragraphs 4 and 5 of its resolution 1565 (2004), it is proposed to establish the post of the Force Commander (Lieutenant General) at the Assistant Secretary-General level. The Force Commander will manage the Mission's military force and have the overall responsibility for the implementation of the adjusted concept of operations for contingents and military observers, ensuring the protection of civilians under imminent threat of physical danger and of United Nations personnel and assets, monitoring and implementing the arms embargo, contributing to the arrangements for the security of the institutions and the protection of officials of the Transitional Government in Kinshasa, supporting and contributing to the disarmament of foreign and Congolese combatants and assisting in the establishment of a secure environment for free, transparent and peaceful elections. While the Force Commander will retain overall strategic command of all the military components of MONUC, the Division Commander (Major General, D-2) will establish Divisional headquarters in Kisangani and will be assigned operational and tactical control of the forces deployed to Kisangani, the Ituri region and North and South Kivus. The position of Division Commander will be accommodated against the approved D-2 level ex-Force Commander post. The Office of the Division Commander will include a Special Adviser (P-4), who would provide advice on a wide range of military, security and tactical issues. The requirements for the post would include the combination of a military background, extensive knowledge of the area of operations and experience in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Office will be supported by an Administrative Assistant (General Service (Other level)) redeployed from the immediate Office of the Director of Administration. National staff: One clerk/driver (national General Service staff) International staff: increase by one post In view of the complexity of the politico-military situation in the east of the country, the Division Commander will be assisted by a Senior Political Affairs Officer (P-5), who will be responsible for providing political advice, including on the potential implications of intended military plans, and will serve as the point of contact with the Heads of Offices in the divisional area of operations and the Political Affairs Division in Kinshasa. The approved Political Affairs Division staffing establishment in Kisangani does not provide for this position. 2.1 Progress in the establishment of the Transitional Government and other transitional institutions 2.1.1-2.1.4 No change 2.2 Progress towards the holding of free and fair national elections 2.2.1-2.2.2 No change 2.2.3 Development of a comprehensive operational plan for all phases of the electoral process for the Independent Electoral Commission 2.2.4 Civic and voter education campaign launched by the Independent Electoral Commission countrywide 2.2.5 All relevant legislation adopted by the Parliament and promulgated by the President 2.2.6 Draft of a new Constitution finalized by parliamentary institutions Daily advice on the electoral process provided to 75 field offices of the Independent Electoral Commission in 11 provinces Organized and co-chaired bi-monthly meetings of the Steering Committee of the Technical Assistance Project on Electoral Assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Weekly meetings with donors to mobilize funds for electoral trust fund Advice on voter registration, logistics, training and civic education to the Independent Electoral Commission USG-ASG Electoral Assistance Division In its resolution 1565 (2004), the Security Council mandated MONUC to establish three joint commissions with a view to assisting the Transitional Government in security sector reform, essential legislation and elections. The status of the implementation of the Security Council mandate with regard to the electoral process is described in paragraph 35 of the report of the Secretary-General of 31 December 2004 (S/2004/1034). While major challenges remain to meeting the electoral schedule, including logistical aspects of the elections and delays in the passage of essential legislation, it is proposed to strengthen the staffing establishment of the Electoral Assistance Division in order to provide broader advice and assistance to the Transitional Government and authorities in the preparations for elections, as follows: International staff: increase by 16 posts The Senior Electoral Assistance Officer (P-5) would be responsible for providing advice and technical support to the Independent Electoral Commission and its electoral offices in the organization of elections in 11 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ensuring the provision of adequate logistical support to the registration process and coordinating the day-to-day activities of the Mission's 15 electoral coordinators.

The Gender Affairs Officer (P-4) would facilitate the integration of a gender perspective into the entire electoral process and provide advice on the strengthening of the capacity of the Independent Electoral Commission in addressing gender-related issues. Seven Logistics Officers (P-3) would design, plan and coordinate logistical support in 11 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, organize the voter registration process and reinforce the capacity of the United Nations Volunteers logistics officers in the 15 provincial electoral offices. Five Civic Education Officers (P-3) would design, plan and coordinate the civic education campaign in the 11 provinces, reinforce the capacity of the United Nations Volunteers civic education officers and coordinate the activities of the various national and international actors participating in the civic and voter education campaign. The Information Technology Officer (P-2) would provide support to the Independent Electoral Commission by preparing the specifications for information technology equipment for the registration and electoral processes, support the national and provincial data processing centres and assist in the design of various databases for use by the Independent Electoral Commission. The post will be redeployed from the Bunia field office. National staff: increase by three posts Three clerks (national General Service staff) would provide administrative support to the Division.

It is proposed to strengthen the staffing establishment of the Unit with a Rule of Law Liaison Officer (P-4) who would be responsible for the identification of needs and facilitation of projects in support of the Mission's mandate in the field and serve as focal point for coordination between heads of field offices and MONUC headquarters. The post will be redeployed from the disbanded Mandate Planning and Tracking Unit. In accordance with paragraph 7 of Security Council resolution 1565 (2004), MONUC is mandated to provide advice and assistance to the Transitional Government and authorities in security sector reform, including in the training and monitoring of the police. The current implementation status of the civilian police concept of operations is described in paragraphs 48 and 49 of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council of 31 December 2004 (S/2004/1034). In view of the evolving tasks of the Mission's civilian police establishment and pursuant to the increase of the civilian police strength to 341 officers, it is proposed to strengthen the Office of the Civilian Police Commissioner as follows. The Deputy Police Commissioner (P-5) would assist the Civilian Police Commissioner (D-1) in providing advice and advocacy at the national and provincial levels focusing on senior-level awareness-building through seminars, workshops and other advocacy initiatives, as well as support for the development and implementation of training initiatives, liaison and coordination of international support for capacity-building, including training and logistical support, maintaining preparedness, in consultation with the Government and donors, to provide training assistance for overall police reform, supervising the Mission's civilian police headquarters operations and liaison sections, providing regular in situ assistance to the Mission's civilian police officers deployed to 11 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and deputizing for the Civilian Police Commissioner during his/her absences. In view of the wide dispersion of civilian police officers throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the limitation of their tours of duty to 12 months, the establishment of the Deputy Police Commissioner post would also strengthen the managerial capacity of the Mission's civilian police headquarters by providing guidance at the senior management level to civilian police officers and ensuring continuity of leadership. United Nations Volunteers: increase by one position The incumbent of the United Nations Volunteers Translator/Interpreter position would provide for the translation of the Mission's official documents and correspondence for the civilian police headquarters staff (mostly francophone), primarily from English into French, and would also provide interpretations. 4.1 Improved humanitarian conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 4.1.1 No change 4.2 Progress in the reintegration of children affected by armed conflict into civil society 4.2.1 No change 4.3 Progress towards national and local reconciliation 4.3.1-4.3.2 No change 4.4 Progress in respect for women and girls 4.4.1 No change 4.5 Progress in combating HIV/AIDS 4.5.1 No change Human resources: Component 4, human dimension of sustainable peace National staff a Humanitarian Affairs Section Gender Issues Unit HIV/AIDS Unit Component 5: Support 5.1 Effective and efficient logistical and administrative support to the Mission 5.1.1 No change Revised 5.1.2 The cost of damage owing to accidents involving United Nations vehicles reduced from $250,000 on 30 June 2004 with an operating fleet of 1,647 to $200,000 on 30 June 2005, with an operating fleet of 1,954 vehicles 5.1.3-5.1.4 No change 5.1.5 Improved direct access to 7 additional medical facilities, from 11 to 18 locations Military and police personnel 100 military observers trained on Global Positioning System and Geographical Information System 5,674 contingent personnel and 86 civilian police emplaced and rotated Contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment verified, monitored and inspected for 5,674 troops Civilian personnel 697 civilian contracts administered (190 international staff, 393 national staff and 115 United Nations Volunteers) Facilities and infrastructure 22 permanent structures rented in 6 major locations 8 solid buildings (non-budgeted contribution) maintained in 5 major locations 78 generators operated and maintained in 16 locations 177 km of road repaired and maintained 7 airfields renovated/repaired A logistics base constructed in Entebbe (Uganda) Ground transportation 306 vehicles maintained and operated in 18 locations 72 heavy/special vehicles maintained and operated in 12 locations Air transportation 6 fixed-wing and 20 rotary-wing aircraft, including 16 military aircraft, managed and operated for 17,400 flight hours Managed up to 5 additional temporary/short-term airfields Communications 24 very small aperture terminals systems installed, maintained and operated at 14 locations 22 telephone exchanges for 6,466 users installed, maintained and operated 55 repeaters and transmitters installed, maintained and operated 15 microwave links installed, maintained and operated 1 global system for mobile communications network installed and supported Information technology 909 desktops, 155 servers , 286 laptops, 694 printers, 28 high-speed scanners and 150 digital senders supported, maintained and repaired in 14 locations 3,000 Geographical Information System maps produced and delivered, both in print and electronic format Medical 100 air medical evacuations undertaken Security 24-hour close protection to senior MONUC staff and visiting high-level officials Daily security situation summaries, monthly and weekly mission-wide security risk management assessments, weekly briefings to the Security Management Team and security alerts, as needed Induction security training for all MONUC staff and specific security training conducted, as required, for 550 staff Security officers trained in unarmed combat, pistol firing, first aid and other security specialist areas 24-hour firefighting capacity in Kinshasa, Kisangani and Bukavu Monthly primary fire training/drills for all new MONUC staff Security arrangements implemented for 6 new sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and logistics base in Entebbe, Uganda Baggage handling/security check for approximately 10,000 MONUC passengers a month at various airports and 200 investigations cases (traffic and road accidents, theft of property) 7 sites for the conduct of elections secured Table 6 Human resources: Component 5, Support Office of the Director of Administration Administrative Services Integrated Support Services Security Section In line with the adjusted logistical support concept of operations, MONUC has reconfigured its administrative organization with a view to providing greater flexibility and responsiveness in supporting the operational and tactical activities of the Mission's military, civilian police and substantive personnel and reviewed the staffing establishment of the administrative and integrated support services to eliminate duplication and operational and functional overlap. In order to support the deployment of the Force to the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the MONUC administration will establish 9 new field offices and a logistical support base in Entebbe (Uganda), incorporate an administrative office in the Divisional headquarters in Kisangani and substantially expand the offices in Bukavu, Bunia and Goma, as well as the logistical support base in Kigoma (United Republic of Tanzania). The Mission's administrative headquarters in Kinshasa will also require strengthening, in view of the redeployment to the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of a reserve battalion and a significant increase in requirements for the centrally administered support to the military contingent personnel, international staff, United Nations Volunteers and national staff. The increased staffing requirements in the new and expanded offices in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo will be partially accommodated through the redeployment of 112 posts and United Nations Volunteer positions from the downsizing offices in the west (Kananga and Mbandaka) and in the east (Kalemie, Kindu, Kisangani and Lubero) of the country, in line with the redeployment of contingents to other locations, for the net additional staffing requirements of 667 posts, including the Security Section. In order to limit the assignment to the Mission of General Service staff from Headquarters and other established offices, it is also proposed to abolish 62 General Service posts, primarily in highly specialized technical areas, and replace them with posts in the Field Service category, as well as to redeploy one post to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and 1 post to the Divisional headquarters in Kisangani. Office of the Director of Administration and heads of regional and field offices Office of the Director of Administration: increase by 13 posts (1 P-5, 6 Field Service, 1 General Service (Other level), 3 national General Service staff posts and 6 United Nations Volunteer positions offset by redeployment of 2 P-4 and 2 P-2 posts) The Office of the Director of Administration, as approved in the initial budget for MONUC, comprises the following units: Budget and Cost Control, Aviation Safety, Administrative Coordination and Mission Support Planning Units. The heads of 17 regional and field offices report directly to the Director of Administration. The proposed revised structure of the Office reflects the consolidation of the administrative coordination and Mission planning functions of the Office through the establishment of an Administrative Planning and Policy Unit, as well as the establishment of Board of Inquiry and United Nations Volunteers Support Units. The staffing establishment of the immediate Office of the Director of Administration would reflect a net reduction of 9 posts to be redeployed to the Office of the Chief of Administrative Services (Staff Counsellor, P-4), the Board of Inquiry Unit (1 P-2, 4 United Nations Volunteer positions and 1 national General Service staff) and to the United Nations Volunteers Support Unit (1 United Nations Volunteer position and 1 national General Service staff post) as detailed under the respective headings below, as well as the redeployment of 1 General Service (Other level) post to the Office of the Force Commander (Divisional headquarters in Kisangani). Administrative Planning and Policy Unit: increase by 7 posts (1 P-5, 1 P-3, 3 Field Service, 1 national General Service staff post and 1 United Nations Volunteer position) The proposed Unit would be headed by a Senior Administrative Officer at the P-5 level (new post) and would be responsible for: providing advice to the Director of Administration on policy and operational decisions in all logistical support matters; preparing and updating the overall Mission support plans and preparing ad hoc support plans for the deployment and redeployment of military and civilian police personnel, as well as plans for the closure and establishment of offices, as required; coordinating with the military, civilian police and substantive components of the Mission on the planning of administrative and logistical support; conducting logistical reconnaissance missions; and maintaining a support requirements database. The staffing establishment of the Office would also comprise staff previously approved for the Administrative Coordination and Mission Support Planning Units (1 Administrative Officer (P-3), 1 Project Officer (Field Service), 1 secretary/clerk (national General Service staff) and 1 United Nations Volunteer position) and would reflect the establishment of 2 new Project Officer posts (Field Service) and the redeployment of 1 P-4 and 2 P-2 posts from the ex-Mission Support Planning Unit to the Security and Safety Section and of 1 United Nations Volunteer position (ex-Administrative Coordination Unit) to the Board of Inquiry Unit. Board of Inquiry Unit: increase by 13 posts (1 P-2, 2 Field Service, 3 General Service (Other level), 1 national General Service staff post and 6 United Nations Volunteer positions) In view of the significant increase in the number of Board of Inquiry cases and the corresponding increase of administrative and paralegal support required to assist the Boards, it is proposed to establish a Board of Inquiry Unit. These functions were previously incorporated in the immediate Office of the Director of Administration. The Unit would be headed by a Chief at the P-2 level (redeployed from the immediate Office of the Director of Administration) and would be responsible for: reviewing and processing all Board of Inquiry cases; providing support to Board of Inquiry members; ensuring compliance with the applicable established procedures; conducting research; maintaining a case database; and providing administrative support to Board of Inquiry members. The proposed staffing establishment of the Unit would also comprise 11 Board of Inquiry Assistants (2 new Field Service posts, 3 General Service (Other level) posts (1 redeployed from the Heads of Regional and Field Administrative Office, 1 from the Aviation Safety Unit and 1 from the Personnel Section) and 6 United Nations Volunteers (2 new positions and 4 redeployed from the immediate Office of the Director of Administration), as well as 1 secretary/clerk (national General Service staff) redeployed from the immediate Office of the Director of Administration). United Nations Volunteers Support Unit: increase by 9 posts (3 national General Service staff posts and 6 United Nations Volunteer positions) In view of the proposed increase of the United Nations Volunteers' strength from 490 to 605 positions, it is proposed to establish a United Nations Volunteers Support Unit headed by a United Nations Volunteers Programme Manager (position redeployed from the immediate Office of the Director of Administration) responsible for the administration and management of the Mission's United Nations Volunteer establishment. The Unit would also comprise 2 Finance Officers, 2 Administrative Officers and 1 Public Information Officer (all United Nations Volunteers, 4 new positions and 1 redeployed from the ex-Administrative Coordination Unit), supported by 3 secretaries/clerks (national General Service staff, 2 new posts and 1 redeployed from the immediate Office of the Director of Administration). Aviation Safety Unit: increase by 1 post It is proposed to establish an Aviation Safety Assistant (Field Service) post and one clerk/driver (national General Service staff, new post) to be offset by the redeployment of 1 General Service (Other level) post to the Board of Inquiry Unit. Heads of regional and field offices: increase by 11 posts (8 Field Service and 8 national General Service staff posts offset by redeployment of 1 P-4 and 4 General Service (Other level) posts) In view of the expansion of MONUC operations in the east of the country and the establishment of a new office in Matadi, Bas-Congo, it is proposed to strengthen the immediate offices of the heads of regional and field offices by establishing 8 additional Administrative Officer (Field Service) and 8 clerks/drivers (national General Service staff, offset by the redeployment of one P-4 post to the Military Planning, Support and Liaison Office, one General Service (Other level) post to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (Protocol Unit), one General Service (Other level) post to the Board of Inquiry Unit and two General Service (Other level) post to the Mission Planning, Support and Liaison Office.
