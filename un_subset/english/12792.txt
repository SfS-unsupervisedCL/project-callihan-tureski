%%%APPOINTMENT OF OFFICIALS|BURUNDI SITUATION|

Letter dated 9 November 2000 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council As you know, we have for some time been providing support to the Arusha peace process on Burundi. Although the Peace Agreement was signed on 28 August 2000, a number of key issues still remain to be negotiated. A meeting is to be held in Arusha towards the end of this month, to resolve outstanding issues, and a donors' conference is planned for 11 and 12 December in Paris to garner support for the implementation of the agreement. I have therefore decided to extend the appointment of Mr. Ayite J. C. Kpakpo, Senior Adviser to the Facilitator, until 31 January 2001. I should be grateful if you would bring this information to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Kofi A. Annan
