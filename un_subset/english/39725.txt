Sixty-first session Agenda item 100 Measures to eliminate international terrorism Letter dated 6 June 2007 from the Permanent Representative of Paraguay to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I am taking this opportunity to transmit to you a copy of the communiqué issued in Asunción on 22 May 2007 by the States parties of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) at the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Common Market (see annex). I should be grateful if the communiqué could be circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 100. (Signed) Eladio Loizaga Permanent Representative Communiqué of the States parties of the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) Asunción, 22 May 2007 The States parties of MERCOSUR reiterate their condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, adhering strictly to international law, international human rights law and international humanitarian law. They also reaffirm the need to prevent impunity for perpetrators of terrorist acts. With regard to the situation of Luís Posada Carriles, who is accused of terrorist acts and implicated in the downing in 1976 of an aircraft belonging to the Compañía Cubana de Aviación, which caused the death of 73 civilians, the States parties of MERCOSUR express their firm belief that the authorities of the United States of America must take steps enabling Luís Posada Carriles to be duly tried for those acts. The States parties of MERCOSUR reaffirm the value of extradition as an essential tool in fighting terrorism and call on States which have received requests from States parties of MERCOSUR for the extradition of terrorists to process those requests in the requisite manner.
