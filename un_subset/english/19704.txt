Letter dated 14 March 2002 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council As you will be aware, the Scottish Court sitting in the Netherlands today gave its response to Mr. Al-Megrahi's appeal against his conviction in the Lockerbie case. The Court reached the conclusion that none of the grounds of appeal were well founded. The appeal was therefore refused. The full (200-page) Opinion of the Court is available on the Internet at the following address: www.scotcourts.gov.uk/html/lockerbie_appeal.htm. I would be grateful if you would have the text of the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Jeremy Greenstock
