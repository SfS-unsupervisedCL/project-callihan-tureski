Letter dated 16 December 2004 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism addressed to the President of the Security Council I refer to my predecessor's letter of 11 November 2003 (S/2003/1104), transmitting a third report from Senegal submitted to the Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 1373 (2001). The Counter-Terrorism Committee has considered the report carefully, with the assistance of its experts, and has written to the Permanent Representative of Senegal to the United Nations to set out its preliminary comments. Senegal has been requested to provide a response in the form of a fourth report by 24 January 2005. I should be grateful if you could arrange for the present letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Andrey I. Denisov Chairman Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism
