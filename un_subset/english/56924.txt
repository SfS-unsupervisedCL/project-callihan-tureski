The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in section V of the present report. 1. The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 6 February 2009 (A/63/710) and amounted to $210,610,000 gross. It provided for the deployment of 34 military liaison officers, 1,045 United Nations police personnel, 560 formed police unit personnel, 452 international staff, 996 national staff inclusive of 72 National Officers, and 146 United Nations Volunteers. Subsequently, the Secretary-General presented requirements for support of village and municipal elections that amounted to $3,073,200 gross, and provided for the temporary deployment of six international (2 P-4, 4 P-3) and six national staff, including two National Officers, as well as 62 United Nations Volunteers (see A/63/710/Add.1). The cost related to the election was to be absorbed within the budget through efficiency measures. 2. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in its report dated 23 April 2009 (A/63/746/Add.3), recommended that the General Assembly appropriate $202,474,338 gross for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. 3. The General Assembly, by its resolution 63/292, appropriated an amount of $205,939,400 gross for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. 4. The budget assumptions provided in the 2009/10 report anticipated the National Police of Timor-Leste (PNTL) resuming primary policing responsibilities in all districts during 2010 and the consequent drawdown of United Nations police personnel, including 236 United Nations police and initially one formed police unit. In January 2010, the United Nations technical assessment mission conducted a thorough assessment of the level of the readiness of PNTL to assume primary policing responsibilities, as well as of the security situation in Timor-Leste. Since the resumption process was lagging with the expected timeline owing to PNTL not adhering to mutually agreed criteria, the technical assessment mission recommended the gradual drawdown of United Nations police personnel from 1,605 to 1,280 by mid-2011, subject to a follow-up assessment to be conducted by the end of 2010. However, the Security Council, in its resolution 1912 of 26 February 2010, extended the mandate of UNMIT retaining the full strength of the United Nations police personnel. II. Mandate performance A. Overall 5. The mandate of the Mission was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1704 (2006) and extended in subsequent resolutions of the Council. The mandate for the performance period was provided by the Council in its resolutions 1867 (2009) and 1912 (2010), by which the Council extended the mandate of UNMIT until 26 February 2011 at its current authorized levels. The report of the Secretary-General of 12 February 2010 (S/2010/85) included an overview of the findings and recommendations of the technical assessment mission, conducted in January 2010, and its broad consultations with the Timorese authorities and other relevant stakeholders. In addition, by its resolution 1867 (2009), the Council also requested UNMIT to extend the necessary support, within its mandate, for the local village (suco) elections in October 2009, in response to the request from the Government of Timor-Leste. 6. The Mission was mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective; namely, to advance the security and stability of an independent Timor-Leste. 7. Within this overall objective, the Mission, during the reporting period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks in section F below for the political process, security sector and rule of law, governance, development and humanitarian coordination, and support components. 8. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based-budgeting frameworks set out in the 2009/10 budget. In particular, this report compares the actual indicators of achievement, that is, the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement, and the actual completed outputs with the planned outputs. B. Budget implementation 9. During the performance period, the Mission played an important role in enhancing the security and stability of an independent Timor-Leste by assisting the Government and relevant national institutions through the facilitation of political dialogue and a culture of democratic governance among Timorese stakeholders. The Mission, in collaboration with international partners, also continued its progress towards national reconciliation through dialogue with key players in the established political parties by convening regular meetings and facilitated dialogue among political parties and political actors, at various levels. The Mission also provided support to village (suco) local elections conducted in a free and fair manner with accepted results by the public. 10. Progress was made in respect to the capacity-building programme to further women's empowerment and gender equality. The National Parliament approved a number of major legislations, including the penal code, the law for community leadership and their elections (sucos), and the law against domestic violence. Progress was also made with respect to finalization of the 2010 State budget, a national security law, a national defence law, an internal security law, the population and housing census, laws on the Anti-Corruption Commission, alterations to the statutes of former liberation combatants, the remuneration regime of the judiciary, the law on territorial and administrative division, and the use of the emblem of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 11. In the substantive area of security sector and rule of law, United Nations police continued to place emphasis on crime control, while placing an increasing focus on preparing PNTL to resume executive responsibilities. Further to the handover of the two districts (Lautem and Oecussi) in the previous fiscal period, a total of four districts (Manatuto, Viqueque, Ainaro, and Baucau) and three units (Police Training Centre, Maritime Unit and Strategic Information Department) were transferred to Timorese authority. The United Nations police revised its concept of operations to reflect a strengthened partnership approach towards the mentoring, monitoring, and advising of PNTL. The PNTL registration and certification process also continued, with 93 per cent of PNTL officers (2,922 out of 3,149) certified as at 30 June 2010. The delay in the resumption of primary policing responsibilities by PNTL was owing to the fact that some districts and units did not meet the criteria agreed to by the Government and the Mission. 12. The Military Liaison Group continued its monitoring activities country-wide with particular emphasis on the most sensitive border areas, such as in Oecussi district. 13. Support to the reform of the security sector continued, especially in the development of a legal framework, with advice given to the National Parliament on the national security law package, promulgated in April 2010, and technical assistance to the Government in drafting the national security policy, which was submitted to the Council of Ministers. 14. In the substantive area of human rights and transitional justice, the Mission provided advice, technical assistance and training to State institutions, including PNTL and the Armed Forces of Timor-Leste (F-FDTL). The Mission also provided advice and assistance to civil society regarding human rights standards and the effective monitoring of human rights violations. Efforts continued to assist the Office of the Prosecutor-General with completion of the investigations into the serious crimes committed in 1999 and to assist the Government and the National Parliament in the implementation of the recommendations of the Truth, Reception and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Truth and Friendship. 15. Under component 3 on governance, development and humanitarian coordination, the Mission continued to provide policy and technical advice and assistance to national institutions and civil society, in partnership with United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and other development and humanitarian partners. 16. Progress towards sustainable democratic State and government institutions was achieved in areas such as decentralization, elections, transparency and accountability, and the civil service. The Government's administrative reform agenda was moved forward with the establishment of the Civil Service Commission and the AntiCorruption Commission. With the support of an integrated UNMIT/United Nations Development Programme electoral team, suco elections were successfully conducted, with strong leadership by the national electoral bodies. However, the Government decided to postpone the municipal elections until after the 2012 general elections. Communication and coordination among institutions and national stakeholders were promoted through the successful organization of six democratic governance forums. 17. In close collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Mission continued to contribute to the development of the justice sector through strategic coordination and by providing technical advice to the Government of Timor-Leste in drafting key legislation, with a particular focus on corrections, gender and juvenile justice, with the aim to strengthen capacities of justice institutions. The independent comprehensive needs assessment of the justice sector, followed by the development of a justice sector strategic plan by the Government of Timor-Leste, were major achievements during the reporting period. 18. In February 2010, substantial progress was achieved in the area of humanitarian assistance, with the closure of all internally displaced persons camps and transitional shelters and a peaceful process to return and reintegrate. Progress was also achieved in developing national disaster preparedness and all small-scale disasters were handled effectively by national authorities. Advice was provided on broad socio-economic issues, with a focus on the effective utilization of oil and gas revenues for projects and programmes related to poverty reduction and economic growth, and the promotion of the Millennium Development Goals. The coordination between government and development partners continued to be strengthened through the national priorities programme in 2009 and 2010, with joint support from the Mission and the World Bank. 19. In support of its planned mandated activities, the Mission achieved an implementation rate of 93 per cent in terms of expenditures compared with approved resources. 20. Budgetary assumptions that were made at the time of formulating the 2009/10 resource requirements for the Mission were subsequently impacted by a number of unforeseen factors throughout the 2009/10 period, which in turn impacted the overall financial performance. These major factors are: (a) An increase in the mission subsistence allowance rate compared with the budget. The budget provided for a rate of $114 per day compared with an actual rate of $119 per day. This was owing to the fact that the approved rates did not take effect until after the budget cycle started; (b) The retention of 236 United Nations police officers and one formed police unit that had been planned to be repatriated resulted in a higher deployment rate than planned. The Mission also realized higher deployment than planned with respect to national staff and United Nations Volunteers; (c) Average national staff salaries increased by 49 per cent compared to the budget in 2009 and 4.5 per cent in 2010; (d) An increase in the price of fuel and the related handling fee. C. Mission support initiatives 21. The Mission continued to provide effective and efficient administrative, logistical and security support to the Mission military, police and civilian personnel. During the 2009/10 fiscal period, the Mission maintained four regional centres (Baucau, Suai, Maliana and Oecussi) and eight subdistrict police offices, as well as support operations in the 13 police headquarters in the districts. 22. The reassessment of the Mission's air transport requirements resulted in the repatriation of one rotary-wing aircraft and not implementing scheduled flights to Denpasar, Indonesia, as planned. Both of these changes resulted in significant reductions in requirements owing to lower actual contract prices of air asset. 23. In addition, efforts were made towards reducing inventories and new purchases, which had an impact on operational costs. Significant lower costs were realized by placing rotating United Nations police officers on planned formed police unit rotation flights, thereby reducing individual ticket purchases. 24. There was significant reduction of diesel consumption of about 16 per cent that resulted from the Mission's greening initiative. The greening initiative also impacted favourably on lower expenditures related to the purchase of stationery. D. Regional mission cooperation 25. Regional cooperation with other peacekeeping missions is a challenge for the Mission because of the location. However, the Mission maintained strong ties with the United Nations Logistics Base for transportation and other services. The Mission also maintained close ties with the United Nations agencies in the region and provided logistical support to these agencies during the reporting period on a surplus capacity basis, or cost recovery as applicable. E. Partnerships, country team coordination and integrated missions 26. Based on the integrated strategic framework, the Mission continued its "one United Nations system" approach through the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Governance Support, Development and Humanitarian Coordination, and the United Nations Resident Coordinator. The Mission continued the strong emphasis on a collaborative, coherent and resource-efficient approach to the implementation of its mandate. To that end, coordination, decision-making and joint planning mechanisms with the United Nations country team continued to function effectively across all mandated areas. 27. In the electoral substantive area, a joint UNMIT/UNDP team (United Nations electoral support team) embedded in the democratic governance unit of the Mission, coordinated the support to the Government of Timor-Leste in organizing the suco elections. The electoral support team continued to help strengthen the institutional capacity of the two electoral management bodies (National Electoral Commission and the Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration) and of political parties. On the governance subject matter, the Mission worked closely with UNDP in providing legislative advice to establish the Civil Service Commission and the AntiCorruption Commission, and with UNDP and the United Nations Capital Development Fund with respect to the legislative framework for decentralization. 28. In the security sector, a joint UNDP/UNMIT team (United Nations security sector reform team), which included UNDP personnel embedded in the security sector support unit of the Mission, continued with the implementation of the security sector review project with an emphasis on capacity-building activities. 29. In the justice sector, the Mission took the lead in the provision of substantive and technical advice regarding several draft laws with strong support from United Nations country team partners, such as UNDP, UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). The United Nations country team, meanwhile, continued to implement major programmes in relevant areas, such as the UNDP justice programme and the UNIFEM/UNFPA joint programme on gender. 30. In the substantive area of humanitarian assistance, the Mission continued to coordinate the humanitarian country team, including relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and international non-governmental organizations. The United Nations country team strengthened its focus on recovery activities, related to the mandate of the Mission, in order to facilitate the provision of relief and recovery assistance, in particular concerning the implementation of the national recovery strategy. Coordinated activities between the Mission and the United Nations country team also focused on strengthening the Government capacity to manage natural disasters, both in terms of development of the legislative framework and response capacity. 31. The Mission provided high-level socio-economic advice, with integrated input from the United Nations system. Finally, in support of the "compact" process, the Mission and United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, including the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, UNDP, the World Health Organization and the International Organization for Migration, as well as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, actively participated in the working groups established to monitor the progress towards the objectives set out in the national priorities programme for 2009 and 2010. F. Results-based-budgeting frameworks Component 1: political process 32. The Mission continued to provide good offices aimed at promoting inclusive and collaborative processes, encouraging active participation in national policy debates and strengthening a culture of democratic governance. Those efforts included weekly meetings of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General with the President, the President of the Parliament, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition. The Special Representative also held monthly meetings with representatives of all the political parties, including those without parliamentary representation, and quarterly meetings with women political party representatives. The Deputy Special Representative for Governance Support, Development and Humanitarian Coordination held weekly meetings with both Deputy Prime Ministers, while the Deputy Special Representative for Security Sector Support and Rule of Law held meetings, normally on a weekly basis, with the Secretary of State for Security, and as necessary with the Secretary of State for Defence. 33. Local elections for community leaders (village chiefs and village councils) were held during the reporting period. They were conducted in a peaceful atmosphere and results were widely accepted by the population. The Mission provided technical and logistical resources and good offices to State institutions, including the National Parliament, the Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration, the National Electoral Commission and community organizations in relation to these elections. 34. The Mission, together with UNIFEM and UNDP, provided technical advice to the Office of the Secretary of State for the Promotion of Equality, the Parliamentary Women's Caucus and civil society on engendering the election laws and regulations to ensure that a quota was included. Expected accomplishment 1.1: consolidation of democracy and long-term stability Planned indicators of achievement Actual indicators of achievement The National Parliament formulates domestic violence law, the 2009 State budget, the anti-corruption commission, weapons use law, the witness protection law, the civil code, electoral laws, including the revised law on village elections and the law on municipality elections, through constructive debates among the members of Parliament as well as through Parliament's public hearing sessions on issues of national interest where civil society, women's organizations and other relevant organizations/institutions are invited, and performs its oversight functions Achieved. Relevant laws were adopted by the National Parliament, except the laws on weapon use, local governance (debate suspended), municipality elections (not discussed yet) and the civil code. Laws approved include the law against domestic violence; on the 2010 State budget; on the Anti-Corruption Commission; on alterations to the statutes of former liberation combatants; on the remuneration regime of the judiciary; on territorial and administrative division; the national security law, the national defence law, the internal security law, the law on the population and housing census and the law on the use of the Red Cross Emblem. Several of these laws were approved after public hearings with members of civil society, including the laws on territorial and administrative division, domestic violence, national security and the Truth, Reception and Reconciliation Commission/Commission on Truth and Friendship follow-up institution (which is still pending approval). Suco (village) and local elections are conducted in a calm and secure environment, with minimum security incidents related to elections, a significant voter turnout and voters behaving in an orderly manner on election day, as well as results widely accepted by the public without resorting to violence, and an orderly transfer of office Achieved. Free and fair elections were conducted in a peaceful atmosphere with a turnout of 67 per cent and only a few isolated security incidents reported. The Government hosts meetings with the participation of both ruling and opposition parties and civil society to make full use of their expertise in policy development, integrating gender and youth perspectives Achieved. The President and the Prime Minister engaged in ongoing dialogue with all political parties, individually or as groups, including the leaders of the opposition, to discuss issues of national interest. Civil society and National Parliament organized dialogues and other forums to discuss integration of gender and youth perspectives in policy development. Planned outputs Completed (number or yes/no) Remarks Provision of advice and good offices through regular meetings to State and Government institutions, political parties and civil society with a view to enhancing a culture of democratic governance Yes The Mission provided advice and facilitated dialogue among political parties and political actors at various levels to ensure discussion among them. Monthly meetings were held with the President and Prime Minister, and weekly meetings were held with the Deputy Prime Minster. Monthly meetings were held with the President of the Parliament, the Secretary-General of Fretilin and the Secretary of State for Defence. Monthly political party meetings were held, including three meetings with women representatives and civil society organizations. Informal meetings were held with political parties, national and local government officials, civil society and non-governmental organizations. Provision of advice and support to the suco (village) and local elections, including through all UNMIT regional offices, in the areas of legal affairs, operations, voter/civic education, information technology, administration and logistics Suco elections were held on 9 October 2009; 10 meetings were held concerning the preparation of the suco election with Government officials and with the opposition leader. The integrated UNMIT/UNDP electoral support team continued to provide electoral advisers collocated with counterparts in the Timorese electoral management bodies. Advisers provided assistance on a wide variety of electoral issues, including legal affairs, operations, voter/civic education, information technology, administration and logistics. Fortnightly meetings of the Trilateral Coordination Forum between the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, the Prime Minister and the Commander of the International Security Forces on security-related issues Three meetings were held to deal with immediate challenges of the 2006 crisis (IDPs, petitioners and Reinado). However, as the security and political situation improved and remained relatively stable, meetings of the Trilateral Coordination Forum were no longer needed to discuss issues taken up on other exchanges between the United Nations, the International Stabilization Force and the Government. Support to gender mainstreaming activities through 2 workshops, 2 interactive forums and 4 meetings to further women's empowerment and gender equality targeting, inter alia, the Women's Parliamentary Caucus in coordination with the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and UNDP for the implementation of the women's political platform and to foster the meaningful participation of women in suco and local elections Training workshops Interactive forums Discussion groups were held that yielded positive results compared to previous suco elections in 2004-2005; the number of female suco chiefs increased from 7 to 11; female aldeia (settlement) chiefs from 22 to 37, with 18 in Dili; and female elder representatives from 2 to 6.

This included the distribution of 2,000 posters and 2,000 postcards. One 1-minute television public service announcement was aired twice a day for a period of 60 days, one 1-minute radio public service announcement was aired on national radio and 15 local community radio stations for a period of 60 days. A voter education and civic education campaign was implemented for the 2009 suco elections in support of national electoral bodies' information campaigns, including three 90-second public service announcements (video and radio) on suco elections law, the electoral process and the role of United Nations support. Expected accomplishment 1.2: progress towards national reconciliation in Timor-Leste Political actors, including political parties and civil society, channel their differences through established democratic institutions and processes Achieved. While there were sharp political differences between the ruling coalition and the opposition on issues such as the budget and the Bere case, these conflicts continued to be channelled through Parliament, most notably concerning the no-confidence parliamentary vote in October 2009. Monthly meetings were held with the leadership to facilitate dialogue among political parties and political actors at various levels to promote constructive discussions among them. State and community dialogue initiatives planned by the Ministry of Social Solidarity and the Office of the President are under way in Dili and the districts Achieved.

The meetings were to provide forums to address pressing political and security issues, particularly in the case of the Trilateral Coordination Forum. They were used intensively to deal with immediate challenges of the 2006 crisis (IDPs, petitioners, Reinado). With the increasing stabilization and peaceful situation, these meetings were discontinued, as they were no longer necessary. Regular meetings of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General with national leaders of political parties and representatives of civil society organizations, including women and youth organizations, to provide a forum for discussion on critical national issues among them and with UNMIT Monthly meetings with political parties, including three with women representatives Meeting with the President of the Timorese Social Democratic Association (ASDT) Meeting with the President of Partido Unidade Nascional (PUN) Meeting with Bishop of Dili Meeting with Bishop of Baucau Provision of good offices by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, through regular meetings, to State and Government leaders, political parties, and other political actors and civil society to address critical issues through inclusive and collaborative approaches and mainstreaming of gender and youth-related issues into national policy debates on critical issues facing the country and in the formulation of legislation Gender and youth-related issues were promoted at monthly meetings with political leadership as noted above.

Specific issues raised included the adoption of laws with gender sensitive provisions in the suco and municipal elections, support provided to the adoption of the law against domestic violence, and issues related to education for girls, reproductive health and socio-economic empowerment. 2 reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on Timor-Leste Reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council (S/2009/504, S/2010/85) were issued to inform the Council on the political and security developments; dialogue and reconciliation; democratic governance; the promotion of human rights; the proposed future role of the Mission and on technical assessment. Design and implementation of nationwide public information campaigns and advocacy programmes in support of Government efforts towards national reconciliation, including the production of weekly radio programmes, monthly video information programmes and written information, such as press releases, posters, fact sheets, newsletters, leaflets and other promotional materials to be distributed and posted on information boards countrywide and on the UNMIT website; and organization of community outreach events with civil society and the public, and press conferences and press events The national unity campaign in partnership with the Government called "One Land, One nation, One future" was carried out to promote the theme of unity 10 years after the referendum on independence, and the transition from conflict to development, which included 2 one-minute radio and television public service announcements aired 150 times each; the publication of 10,000 poster prints and 5,000 fliers; a photo exhibition in the presidential palace that was attended by 500 visitors; 3,000 printed catalogues of the photo exhibition; and 60 street and stand-alone banners. The Communications and Public Information Office outreach, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 34 students from the University of Timor-Leste, coordinated the first ever Model United Nations in Timor-Leste, which was held on United Nations Day. Regular meetings with the Government, under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance, and development partners, including bilateral and multilateral donors and the United Nations country team, as stakeholders of the international compact/ national priorities programme, to provide advice on the identification of national priorities relevant to political and security-related issues and to coordinate mechanisms to monitor progress towards the implementation of such priorities Quarterly meetings were held with development partners. Discussions focused on progress towards the implementation of the national priorities, including political and security-related issues and inter-ministerial coordination. An international consultative meeting was held on fragile States dialogue and aid effectiveness to improve development and stability. Component 2: security sector and rule of law 35. During the 2009/10 fiscal period, the Mission continued to assist the Government of Timor-Leste in the maintenance of security; to liaise with the national military authorities; to monitor the security situation through the Military Liaison Group; and to assist the Government in the strengthening of human rights and transitional justice and the strengthening of the overall justice system of Timor-Leste. 36. Four additional districts were handed over to PNTL for executive policing. PNTL certification level reached the 93 per cent level, with the remaining officers in various stages of the mentoring programme or facing disciplinary actions because of integrity issues. The United Nations police also continued monitoring and mentoring PNTL in the districts and units that have been handed over. The United Nations police continued to execute authority in the districts and units that had not been handed over, while providing guidance and training to build the capacity of PNTL personnel. 37. A comprehensive review of the security sector was produced and is currently under review with the President's security sector reform and development team. Discussions with national authorities on the public perception survey are ongoing as part of the review. Meanwhile, reform activities that began in 2008 increased with the launching in 2009 of donor-funded United Nations security sector reform capacity development facility projects and have been instrumental in ensuring national engagement in the review process. 38. The human rights and transitional justice initiatives have achieved good progress in strengthening the capacity of State actors, national institutions and civil society organizations. The progress is reflected in the improved quality of reports produced by the Provedoria (the Ombudsman's Office) and the improved drafting of project proposals by civil society organizations. Several human rights trainings were conducted for the Provedoria staff and two human rights officers continued to collocate at Provedoria providing daily mentoring. More than 70 trainings were provided to civil society organizations on human rights topics. Support was provided to parliamentary committee A in the drafting of a reparations programme and a draft law on the Truth, Reception and Reconciliation Commission/Commission of Truth and Friendship follow-up institution. The Mission continued to monitor the human rights situation. Detention cells and prisons were monitored. A public report on human rights developments in Timor-Leste was launched on 15 September 2009. All trial sessions of the 11 February 2008 attacks (more than 40 sessions) were monitored. Some progress has been achieved regarding cases recommended for investigation and prosecution by the Independent Special Commission of Inquiry. There were final judgements in three cases. Less progress has been achieved in the incorporation of human rights into the regular training curriculum of PNTL and the Armed Forces of Timor-Leste (F-FDTL) owing to other priorities of the security forces. 39. The Mission's serious crimes investigation team continued to assist the Office of the Prosecutor-General in the process of establishing accountability for the serious human rights violations committed in East Timor in 1999 and concluded another 70 investigations in the 2009/10 reporting period, bringing the total number of cases concluded to 150, out of the 396 cases remaining. Progress was slightly slower than desired owing to the difficulty in reaching witnesses in remote areas due to the prolonged rainy season. The prolonged rainy season also affected the recruitment of a gender affairs officer, a forensic anthropologist, two legal coordination officers and a sufficient number of investigators. Expected accomplishment 2.1: maintenance of public security in Timor-Leste No increase in the average daily number of security incidents, including fighting and public disturbance, from the average level of 105 per week in the previous 12 months (2008/09). An improved and broader based reporting system has shown an increase in crime reporting by the local populace resulting in an increase in the average daily number of crime incidents, from the average level of 54 per week in 2007/08 to 105 incidents per week in 2008/09. The incident reporting includes complaints made at police stations, to police patrols and walk-ins and comprises all types of major and minor crimes Achieved. There was an average of 82.5 security incidents per week, a reduction of 22.5 incidents per week from the 2008/09 reporting period. This was achieved through active community policing and crime prevention activities.

During the performance period, a total of $3,940,000 was redeployed from the operational costs primarily to cover shortfall owing to higher rates for mission subsistence allowance for military observers, United Nations police and formed police units. In addition, the shortfall was partly owing to the retention of one formed police unit and its contingent-owned equipment and to higher salaries for national staff than planned. C.

IV. Analysis of variances 50. The variance under this heading is attributable to the increase in mission subsistence allowance rate. The rates were implemented after the budget proposal was presented and the new rate of $140 for the first 30 days and $119 thereafter was not reflected in the budget. The increase is partially offset by reduced costs related to travel for emplacement, rotation and repatriation owing to lower ticket prices, in addition to no claims for death and disability reported. 51. The variance under this heading is attributable to an increase in the mission subsistence allowance rates and the higher than anticipated incumbency level. The average strength was 971, compared to the budgeted level of 892 United Nations police. The variance is offset by reduced costs related to the travel for emplacement, rotation and repatriation owing to usage of chartered flights instead of individual commercial tickets. 52. The variance under this heading is attributable to reduced requirement for travel for emplacement and rotation owing to the usage of chartered flights instead of commercial ticket, partially offset by higher reimbursement for cost of the police units and related contingent-owned equipment since one formed police unit did not repatriate. In addition, the reduced requirement is due to lower freight costs for contingent-owned equipment. 53. The variance under this heading is mainly attributable to lower expenditures under common staff costs, as compared with the budgeted amount, which included provisions for changes to common staff costs in accordance with General Assembly resolution 63/250 on new contractual arrangements for staff effective 1 July 2009. While provision was made for an average of 357 personnel with respect to the estimated international staff costs, the actual average was 358 for the period. The decrease in cost is partially offset by higher costs under staff salaries and staff assessment due to higher average salary than budgeted. 54. The variance resulted primarily from higher requirements for national staff salaries due to increased average salary levels and related costs resulting from the new contractual arrangements in accordance with General Assembly resolution 63/250. In addition, the actual vacancy rate of 9.3 per cent was lower compared to 10 per cent approved in the budget. 55. The variance under this heading is attributable to the repatriation of 50 per cent of the temporary volunteers following the elections held in December 2009. The temporary volunteers were budgeted for 11 months; however, 29 out of 62 were repatriated after six months. The other 50 per cent were assigned to assist with the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. 56. The variance under this heading is mainly attributable to delayed recruitment and vacancy rate of 63.6 per cent for international staff. 57. The variance under this heading is attributable to lower costs for non-training consultants owing to deferral of the political affairs programme for analysis of political parties' strategies and interaction with emerging businesses in Timor-Leste. In addition, the training unit did not have the full capacity to embark on all training activities within the Mission and, as such, some trainings planned for this fiscal year were not conducted. 58. The variance under this heading is attributable to a reduction in mission travel, which was well monitored throughout the fiscal year, in addition to the lower actual travel costs than planned. Moreover, some planned overseas training and travel was postponed in order to maintain a normal workflow and to secure adequate coverage in the Mission. 59. The variance under this heading is attributable to a reduction in the cost for maintenance services following competitive bidding, a delay in the supply of photocopiers, fewer prefabricated facilities purchased, no road work performed and lower expenditures for cleaning materials. The underexpenditures are partially offset by higher expenditures for spare parts, petrol oil and lubricants, maintenance supplies and office furniture. 60. The variance under this heading is primarily attributable to higher fuel expenditures due to the higher than budgeted price of fuel despite reduced consumption. While the amount of $0.40 per litre was budgeted, $0.65 was the average actual unit cost. In addition, the increase in cost is due to related handling charges, the purchase of a ground power unit and charges of the previous fiscal year for freight costs for vehicles that had been erroneously charged against another mission. These were partially offset by lower expenditures for repairs and spare parts. 61. The variance under this heading is attributable to lower actual flying hours and costs for the operations of fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft, as well as reduced costs for aviation fuel due to lower utilization. The flying hours were reduced owing to the Mission's change in concept of operations and flight plan. In addition, one rotary-wing aircraft was repatriated in November 2009. The reduced requirement was also partly owing to lower costs of services than anticipated owing to the decision not to procure the services of a professional emergency response team. 62. The variance under this heading is mainly attributable to lower costs as a result of vendor's inability to establish communication lines to the United Nations Logistics Base and the fluctuations in usage. The lower cost was also due to fewer monthly rentals for Timor Telecom sites. Expenses for public information services were also lower owing to delayed recruitment of personnel. 63. The variance under this heading is attributable to lower resources required for equipment and licences than planned owing to the good condition, maintenance and handling of the equipment. In addition, the underexpenditure is due to delays in the implementation and procurement of new application licences in the 2010/11 fiscal period. The variance was offset by an increase in the charges by service providers. 64. The variance under this heading is primarily attributable to lack of requirement for medical evacuation of personnel by air ambulance to a hospital in Adelaide or Sydney. The lower expenditure was also partly attributable to a reduced requirement for medical supplies because of a delay in opening the new level-I plus facility. 65. The variance under this heading is attributable to the deferral of purchases for welfare equipment and other equipment and lower cost of general insurance. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 66. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste are: (a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $14,820,600 with respect to the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010; (b) To decide on the treatment of other income for the period ended 30 June 2010 amounting to $2,974,900 from interest income ($834,900), other/miscellaneous income ($821,100) and cancellation of prior-period obligations ($1,320,400), offset by prior-period adjustments ($1,500).
