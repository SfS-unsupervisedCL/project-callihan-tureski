Item 134 of the preliminary list* Programme planning Proposed strategic framework for the period 2016-2017 Part two: biennial programme plan Programme 3 Disarmament Contents Page Overall orientation Subprogramme 1. Multilateral negotiations on arms limitation and disarmament Subprogramme 2. Weapons of mass destruction Subprogramme 3. Conventional arms (including practical disarmament measures) Subprogramme 4. Information and outreach Subprogramme 5. Regional disarmament Legislative mandates 3.1 General and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control remains the ultimate goal of all efforts exerted in the field of disarmament. The main responsibilities for disarmament lie with Member States. The United Nations, in accordance with its Charter, has a central role and primary responsibility in supporting Member States in this area. 3.2 The mandate for the programme is derived from the priorities established in relevant General Assembly resolutions and decisions in the field of disarmament, including the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, the first special session devoted to disarmament (resolution S-10/2). The programme is also guided by the United Nations Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, continue to be of primary concern to the Organization owing to their destructive power and the threat that they pose to humanity. Conventional weapons, small arms, light weapons, landmines and cluster munitions have received increased attention from the international community. 3.3 Within the Secretariat, substantive responsibility for the programme is vested in the Office for Disarmament Affairs. The strategy of the Office in meeting the programme's objectives is designed around five subprogrammes and is based on its role in and responsibility for facilitating and encouraging, as appropriate, measures aimed at disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects and at all levels. The Office will continue to assist Member States in promoting, strengthening and consolidating multilaterally negotiated principles and norms in all areas of disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects. It will support efforts of Member States in the areas of disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects in order to promote international peace and security and contribute to global efforts against terrorism. The Office will enhance its capacity for more in-depth analysis, keeping track of developments in those areas, and provide Member States with timely and practical advice, as requested. It will continue to assist Member States in their efforts towards international regulation of the arms trade and prevention of the illicit manufacture of and trafficking in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects. 3.4 The Office will assist States in increasing understanding of the relationship between disarmament and development. It will promote transparency, based on the principle of undiminished and increased security for all, and confidence-building measures in the field of disarmament. Through its regional centres for peace and disarmament, the Office will assist Member States in promoting regional approaches to disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects and regional and international peace and security. 3.5 The Office will seek to achieve the objectives of the programme by facilitating the process of multilateral deliberation and negotiation. This will include providing substantive organizational support to the First Committee, the Disarmament Commission and other subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly, the Conference on Disarmament and its subsidiary bodies, review conferences and other meetings of parties to multilateral disarmament agreements, as well as to expert groups mandated by the General Assembly. 3.6 The Office will continue to be a source of impartial and factual information on disarmament and security-related matters for Member States, organizations of the United Nations system and intergovernmental, regional and non-governmental organizations and will expand its educational outreach programmes. Training and advisory services will continue to be provided, through the United Nations Disarmament Fellowship, Training and Advisory Services Programme and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, to Member States, in particular developing countries, to enable them to enhance their expertise in disarmament so that they can participate more effectively in international deliberating and negotiating forums. 3.7 The continued implementation of a gender plan of action aimed at raising awareness of gender mainstreaming in disarmament affairs will continue to be an integral part of the activities of the programme.
