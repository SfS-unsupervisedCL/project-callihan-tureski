To reaffirm without qualification the absolute sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over its three islands of the Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa and to support all peaceful measures and means adopted by the United Arab Emirates to regain its sovereignty over the occupied islands; 2. To denounce the continued consolidation by the Iranian Government of its occupation of the three islands and its violation of the sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates, which can only undermine security and stability in the region and pose a threat to international peace and security; 3. To condemn the building by the Iranian Government of housing facilities to settle Iranians on the three occupied islands of the United Arab Emirates; 4. To condemn the Iranian military manoeuvres being conducted also on the three occupied islands of the United Arab Emirates, namely, the Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, and in those islands' territorial waters, airspace, continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which constitute an inseparable part of the United Arab Emirates; and to request that Iran desist from such violations and acts of provocation, which constitute interference in the internal affairs of an independent, sovereign State; do not promote confidence-building; threaten security and stability in the region; and endanger the security and safety of regional and international navigation in the Arabian Gulf; 5. To condemn the opening by Iran of two offices on the island of Abu Musa belonging to the United Arab Emirates and to call upon Iran to close down those illegitimate facilities and respect the sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over its territory; 6. To denounce and condemn the planned fact-finding visit of the members of the National Security and Foreign Policy Committee of the Iranian Consultative Assembly to the occupied islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates, namely the Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, an act that would violate the sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over its territory and would be inconsistent with attempts to find a peaceful settlement; and to call upon Iran to desist from taking such provocative steps; 7. To commend the United Arab Emirates on its initiative to find a peaceful and just settlement to the issue of the three occupied islands (the Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa) with the Islamic Republic of Iran; 8. To appeal once again to the Iranian Government to end its occupation of the three islands of the United Arab Emirates, refrain from trying to impose a fait accompli by force, desist from establishing any installations there for the purpose of modifying the islands' demographic structure, revoke all measures and remove all installations unilaterally executed by Iran on the three Arab islands, inasmuch as such measures and claims are null and void, lack any legal effect, do not detract from the established right of the United Arab Emirates over its three islands and are acts that run counter to the provisions of international law and the Geneva Conventions of 1949; and to call upon the Iranian Government to adopt peaceful means for resolving the existing dispute over them in accordance with the principles and norms of international law, including agreement to refer the matter to the International Court of Justice; 9. To express the hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran will reconsider its position of rejecting the effort to find a peaceful solution to the issue of the three occupied islands of the United Arab Emirates either through direct, earnest negotiations or through recourse to the International Court of Justice; 10. To call upon Iran to translate its stated desire for improved relations with the Arab countries and for dialogue and d√©tente into concrete steps, both in word and in deed, in the form of a genuine response to the earnest appeals launched by His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates, and by the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Arab States, international groups, friendly nations and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, calling for a solution to the dispute over the three occupied islands by peaceful means in accordance with customary practice and the covenants and rules of international law, either through direct, earnest negotiations or through recourse to the International Court of Justice, with a view to building trust and enhancing security and stability in the Arabian Gulf region; 11. To have all Arab States undertake, in their contacts with Iran, to raise the issue of that country's occupation of the three islands in order to stress the need to end it, based on the fact that the three islands are occupied Arab territory; 12. To inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the Security Council of the importance of maintaining the issue on the list of matters of which the Security Council is seized until Iran ends its occupation of the three Arab islands and the United Arab Emirates regains its full sovereignty over them; 13. To request the Secretary-General of the League to follow up this matter and report to the Council at its next session.
