Letter dated 18 March 2011 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1973 (2011) adopted on 17 March. In accordance with paragraphs 4 and 8 of that resolution, I hereby notify you that the United Kingdom will take measures under the authorizations conferred in those paragraphs which are necessary to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack in Libya and to enforce compliance with the ban on flights in Libyan airspace imposed by paragraph 6 of that resolution. I can confirm the intention of my Government to inform you immediately of any measures taken in the exercise of these authorizations. My Government has today written in parallel to the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to notify him that the United Kingdom will take measures under paragraph 8 of resolution 1973 (2011). I would be grateful if you would circulate the present letter as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Mark Lyall Grant
