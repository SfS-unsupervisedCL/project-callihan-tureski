Letter dated 27 August 2009 from the President of the Security Council addressed to the Secretary-General In my capacity as President of the Security Council, I am forwarding to you a letter dated 12 August 2009 from the Chairman of the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict established by Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), based on the Working Group's conclusions adopted on 1 July 2009 (S/AC.51/2009/2) (see annex). (Signed) John Sawers President of the Security Council Letter dated 12 August 2009 from the Chairman of the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict addressed to the Secretary-General On 24 February 2009 the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, established by Security Council resolution 1612 (2005), examined the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in the Central African Republic (S/2009/66). Following its meeting on 1 July, the Working Group adopted its conclusions on the parties to the armed conflict in the Central African Republic (S/AC.51/2009/2). In follow-up to the recommendations of the Working Group, approved by the Security Council, and subject to and consistent with applicable international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolution 1612 (2005), I am entrusted, in my capacity as the Chairman of the Working Group, to recall the presidential statement of the Security Council (S/PRST/2009/5), in which the Council welcomed your recommendation to establish a United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA) and also to recall its request to ensure that child protection is properly addressed in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. I also welcome your recommendation to your Special Representative for the Central African Republic and relevant United Nations entities to ensure that systematic dialogue is established between the United Nations and relevant parties to the conflict for the preparation of action plans to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers in the framework of Security Council resolution 1612 (2005). I invite you to continue strengthening the Task Force on Monitoring and Reporting; to liaise, as appropriate, with national institutions as well as relevant non-governmental organizations and civil society networks to ensure effective collaboration and coordination of child protection activities; and to ensure, given the regional dimension of the crisis involving the Central African Republic, Chad and the Sudan and the grave implications for children, better information exchange and closer cooperation between respective United Nations country teams and peacekeeping missions on child protection issues; and take note with appreciation of the framework of collaboration currently being piloted between the UNICEF Child Protection Sections in the Central African Republic and Chad. Likewise and bearing in mind the establishment of BINUCA, I invite you to designate as a matter of priority a child protection adviser and consider strengthening the child protection capacity of the new office. Also, I invite you to promote dialogue among relevant stakeholders' organizations aimed at enhancing child protection and prevention of child recruitment in the region, including cross-border issues; as well as to request the United Nations Development Programme, UNICEF and other relevant United Nations entities, within their respective mandates and approved resources and in close cooperation with the Government of the Central African Republic and the Peacebuilding Commission, to continue to address socio-economic issues as a matter of priority, to contribute to addressing the welfare of children affected by armed conflict by, inter alia, providing assistance to improve the implementation of rehabilitation and reintegration programmes, and to strengthen the education system, including in conflict-affected areas. Lastly, I invite you to highlight the need for enhanced capacity in child protection, including the capacity to protect children from killing, maiming, sexual violence, abduction and all other forms of violence, and ensure that it is taken into account and effectively implemented by BINUCA, the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), in accordance with their respective mandates; and to consider addressing the long-term effects of armed conflict on children by supporting the development of basic services, including a health-care system to facilitate their full recovery, which would include adequate attention to psychological care for all children affected by armed conflict, in particular children with disabilities, and access to sexual and reproductive health services, in particular for victims of sexual violence.
