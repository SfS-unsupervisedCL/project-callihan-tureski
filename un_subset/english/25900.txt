General Assembly Fifty-eighth session Agenda item 37 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Fifty-ninth year Letter dated 17 May 2004 from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit hereunder a summary of the violations and acts of aggression committed by Israel against Lebanon. On 1 May 2004, at 0229 hours, two flares were launched from an Israeli patrol boat off the coast of Ra's Naqurah. On 3 May 2004, at 0215 hours, a flare was launched from an Israeli patrol boat off the coast of Ra's Naqurah. At 1909 hours, a number of rounds were fired from the same location. On 5 May 2004, at 2230 hours, a number of rounds were fired from an Israeli patrol boat off the coast of Ra's Naqurah. On 6 May 2004, at 0430 hours, four flares were launched from an Israeli patrol boat off the coast of Ra's Naqurah. At 0800 hours, a number of rounds were fired from the same location. On 8 May 2004, between 1140 and 1340 hours, a number of rounds were fired from an Israeli patrol boat off the coast of Ra's Naqurah. On 9 May 2004, at 0700 hours, a number of rounds were fired from an Israel patrol boat off the coast of Ra's Naqurah. Between 0920 and 1210 hours, Israeli helicopters overflew the occupied Shab'a Farms and the Bint Jubayl and Tyre areas at medium altitude. Between 1215 and 1240 hours, two Israeli helicopters overflew the occupied Shab'a Farms at medium altitude. Between 1400 hours and 1600 hours, an Israeli reconnaissance airplane overflew the occupied Shab'a Farms at medium altitude. Between 1630 hours and 1635 hours, an Israeli combat aircraft violated Lebanese airspace and overflew the Tibnin area at varying altitudes. On 10 May 2004, between 1920 hours and 1930 hours, Israeli combat aircraft overflew the occupied Shab'a Farms at varying altitudes. On 13 May 2004, between 1300 and 1315 hours, two Israeli combat aircraft overflew the area off the coast of Adlun, at varying altitudes, heading in the direction of Beirut, then left Lebanese airspace heading south in the direction of Naqurah. Between 2055 and 2210 hours, two Israeli reconnaissance aircraft circled the sea off the coast of Sidon, overflying the Sidon and Beirut areas before heading south in the direction of Naqurah. These grave acts are part of a series of provocative and continuing Israeli violations of Lebanese maritime territory and airspace. You have repeatedly stated, moreover, that Israel must put an end to these acts, which are in violation of the rules of international law and the resolutions of the United Nations. In view of these violations and the escalating Israeli threats against the State of Lebanon, its territory and people, Lebanon calls upon the Security Council to take action to oblige Israel to put an end to its violations and threats, which endanger international peace and security, and to place on it full responsibility for the possible consequences of its acts. I wish to underscore to you the gravity of the above-mentioned acts and the consequences to which they may give rise and to request that the text of this letter be circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 37, and of the Security Council.
