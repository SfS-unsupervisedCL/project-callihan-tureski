Substantive session of 2013 Geneva, 1-26 July 2013 * E/2013/100. Item 14 (e) of the provisional agenda* Social and human rights questions:United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Note verbale dated 21 June 2013 from the Permanent Mission of Senegal to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General The Permanent Mission of the Republic of Senegal to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Secretary-General and, with reference to General Assembly resolution 1166 (XII) of 26 November 1957, which concerns the establishment of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and to the other resolutions of the Assembly and the Economic and Social Council on the enlargement of the membership of the Executive Committee, has the honour to inform him that the Government of the Republic of Senegal has decided to submit its candidature for membership in the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. As a country that is committed to the protection and promotion of human rights in general and the rights of refugees in particular, Senegal, which is a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol thereto, the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, has always shown a keen interest in seeking joint solutions to the problems of refugees at the national and international levels. This interest is reflected in the adoption of Act No. 68-27 of 24 July 1968 concerning the status of refugees, which established the National Commission on Eligibility for Refugee Status and set out the rights of refugees, highlighting the principle of non-discrimination whereby refugees on Senegalese territory enjoy the same treatment as nationals in the areas of education, access to employment, freedom of movement and access to basic social services and health care. The National Commission on Eligibility for Refugee Status, which is chaired by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, has helped to address the situation of nationals of, inter alia, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Rwanda, CÃ´te d'Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. To date, Senegal has received more than 16,000 refugees and asylum-seekers and, thanks to its excellent collaboration with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has a regional Office in the Senegalese capital, over 25,000 Mauritanian refugees have already been repatriated safely and with dignity. In light of the foregoing and on the basis of its experience with such matters, Senegal is convinced that, as a member of the Executive Committee of the Executive of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, it could contribute significantly to the work of that august body and put its dedication to the cause of refugees into action. The Permanent Mission of Senegal hopes that the Economic and Social Council will give favourable consideration to the Republic of Senegal's request to become a member of the Executive Committee and thanks the Secretary-General in advance.
