Timber Subprogramme 8. Human settlements Subprogramme 9. Industrial restructuring and enterprise development Legislative mandates 16.1 The programme is under the responsibility of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE). 16.2 The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 36 (IV) of 28 March 1947, established the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and assigned to it responsibilities for coordination and promotion of international economic cooperation in Europe. Further direction to the programme is provided by the Declaration on the Strengthening of Economic Cooperation in Europe and its annexed Plan of Action, both endorsed by the Council in its decision 1997/224. Taking into account the role of the regional commissions, as set forth in Economic and Social Council resolution 1998/46 of 31 July 1998, and the goals and commitments contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development, the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing 2002, adopted at the Second World Assembly on Ageing and the related Regional Implementation Strategy Adopted in Berlin, the main objectives of the ECE work programme for the biennium 2006-2007 will be: (a) to promote the economic integration of ECE countries in the context of the post-enlargement European Union and taking into account the various stages of development of countries of the region with economies in transition (acceding countries, emerging market economies and less advanced transition economies); (b) to foster sustainable development in the countries of the region, with a focus on promoting the conditions for sustained growth and trade and improving the environment; and (c) to contribute to the economic and environmental dimensions of security in Europe. 16.3 The overall ECE programme of work is designed around nine interdependent and complementary subprogrammes, namely: Environment, Transport, Statistics, Economic analysis, Sustainable energy, Trade development, Timber, Human settlements and Industrial restructuring and enterprise development. The core strategy involves the negotiation and implementation of conventions, norms, standards and guidelines; the promotion of dialogue in economic cooperation and development and the exchange of information and experience in the key areas of ECE work; the development of policy analysis, studies and supporting statistics; and the provision of technical assistance. 16.4 ECE will bring about a further achievement of economic integration in the region as a whole and, in particular, closer cooperation between countries of the enlarged European Union and non-acceding countries through its work in the further development and maintenance of norms and standards, with an emphasis on their implementation. The work in this area will also have a positive impact on the rest of the world as more of the ECE-developed agreements and standards, in particular in the areas of transport, trade facilitation, statistics, energy and environmental protection, are expected to become accepted for use in non-ECE countries. 16.5 ECE will also contribute to reducing disparities and preventing the emergence of new dividing lines in Europe by promoting greater regulatory compatibility among ECE Member States. Through policy discussions, the exchange of experiences and projects, in particular for improving trade and investment flows, transport infrastructure and energy networks, the integration between the enlarged European Union and other countries will be fostered. 16.6 The ECE's work in the area of policy analysis will be covering the core United Nations development-related themes addressed in the Millennium Declaration and the outcomes of recent United Nations summits and major forums, reflecting the progress made in the region in the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals of the United Nations. 16.7 Technical cooperation activities will be carried out in accordance with the ECE Technical Cooperation Strategy, which was endorsed at the fifty-ninth session of the Commission in 2004. Activities will be streamlined and focused on south-east Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in particular Central Asia and the Caucasus. A unifying strategy to identify the needs of these countries and to determine activities responding thereto will be carried out with the objectives of: (a) improving national capacities to implement legally binding instruments and other regional standards, including those developed by ECE; and (b) finding solutions to address transboundary problems. 16.8 The economic and environmental dimensions of security in the region have been given a new impetus through the adoption, in December 2003, of the New Strategy Document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), in which ECE was identified as a key partner for reviewing the commitments in their economic and environmental dimensions. ECE will, therefore, further integrate the security dimension in its relevant subprogrammes, with a view to contributing to the review and implementation of those commitments that correspond to its areas of expertise as agreed in the memorandum of understanding with OSCE and in the work plan set up between the two organizations. Subprogramme 1 Environment Objective of the Organization: To improve environmental management, reduce the overall pollution burden throughout the region and strengthen the environmental pillar of sustainable development. Expected accomplishments of the Secretariat Indicators of achievement (a) Further mainstreaming of environmental concerns into policy formulation by Governments and implementation through the "Environment for Europe" process and other sustainable development activities (a) Percentage of implemented decisions/ commitments by ECE Member States that relate to the integration of environmental concerns into policy formulation (b) Increased adherence to and further implementation by countries in meeting their obligations under ECE legal instruments for the protection of the environment (b) (i) Number of ratifications of ECE environmental conventions and protocols (ii) Number of reports from parties indicating significant progress in implementing key obligations (c) Improved environmental performance in countries with economies in transition (c) (i) Number of countries having carried out environmental performance reviews by the end of the biennium (ii) Number of countries that have implemented more than 50 per cent of the recommendations contained in the first environmental performance review, as reflected in the second reviews and in country reports Strategy 16.9 In line with this objective, the Environment and Human Settlements Division will further promote sustainable development in the ECE region. Work will focus on the implementation of the ECE environmental conventions and their protocols and the conduct of the second round of environmental performance reviews of countries with economies in transition. Furthermore, the subprogramme will contribute to the implementation of the Millennium Declaration and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation in the ECE region and the outcomes of regional environment and sustainable development conferences, in particular the ministerial conferences "Environment for Europe" (Kiev 2003 and Belgrade 2007). 16.10 In particular, and consistent with the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, actions will be taken to: promote multi-stakeholder participation; supporting processes and partnerships in the region resulting from the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the "Environment for Europe" process and the work of the Commission on Sustainable Development; contribute to the environmental dimension of security; and promote intersectoral programmes and projects, including water and environment, transport and environment, health and environment and education for sustainable development. It will also contribute to the regional submissions related to the priority areas of the 2006-2009 programme cycle of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Special activities for the implementation of the Commission's legally binding instruments will be undertaken, in particular supporting implementation of regional and subregional agreements and action programmes; evaluating and supporting enforcement and compliance with agreements; and providing timely and accurate environmental information. Subprogramme 2 Transport Objective of the Organization: To facilitate the international movement of persons and goods by inland transport modes and improve safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and security in the transport sector to levels that contribute effectively to sustainable development. (a) Adoption, at the regional and/or global level, of amendments to existing legal instruments and recommendations on road transport, road, rail, inland water and combined transport infrastructure, border crossing, transport of dangerous goods and other transport issues, as well as to vehicle regulations, and development of new legal instruments and new vehicle regulations, including global vehicle regulations (a) (i) Number of existing legal instruments amended (ii) Number of amendments to existing vehicle regulations and number of new vehicle regulations, including global vehicle regulations, adopted (iii) Number of adopted amendments to the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and to the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (b) Increased implementation of the ECE legal instruments and recommendations on transport (b) (i) Number of new accessions of Member States to ECE legal instruments on transport (ii) Number of international and national legal instruments amended to reflect the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and other ECE legal instruments of transport (c) Further development of transport infrastructure conducive to strengthening economic cooperation within the region, in particular between the enlarged European Union and the non-acceding countries, taking into consideration the imperative of sustainable development (c) Number of kilometres of new and improved road and rail transport infrastructures along main transport links in non-acceding countries 16.11 In order to achieve the above objective, the Transport Division will update and improve the existing set of ECE legal instruments and recommendations governing inland transport in the region by incorporating new technological developments, political and economic changes as well as measures aimed at reducing further the number of transport accidents and the impacts of transport on the environment. The Division will also incorporate adequate measures to address new security threats in, or related to, the transport sector. It will extend the globalization of some of its legal instruments on transport, particularly in the areas of vehicle construction, transit, transport of dangerous goods and road safety. This will be achieved through consensus and agreement reached at the intergovernmental meetings of the Inland Transport Committee and its Bureau, on the basis of relevant substantive documentation and provision of efficient meetings services by the Transport Division. Dissemination of the outcome of meetings, performance of the legal and administrative functions related to international legal instruments and promotion of the implementation of these instruments and recommendations, including through advisory services, are also an integral part of the strategy. The Transport Division provides assistance in planning and developing road and rail transport infrastructures. The needs of the beneficiaries are also met through the participation of other United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) representing transport operators, other relevant industries, transport users and consumers in the above-mentioned meetings. 16.12 This strategy also applies to the Economic and Social Council's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals and its subsidiary bodies, to which the Transport Division also provides a secretariat. Subprogramme 3 Statistics Objective of the Organization: To improve the reliability of national official statistics and ensure their comparability at the international level. (a) Further developed national institutional frameworks and corresponding implementation practices of member countries, in line with the ECE Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (a) (i) Number of countries ensuring better compliance with the Fundamental Principles through revisions of their national statistical legislations (ii) Number of ECE recommendations implemented to improve national institutional frameworks for official statistics (b) Increased implementation of internationally recommended standards and practices to ensure comparable statistics, particularly by the less advanced countries in the region (b) (i) Number of new or revised statistical standards endorsed by a statistical authority to which the ECE has contributed in substance (ii) Number of countries in CIS and south-east Europe having implemented essential internationally recommended standards and practices in macroeconomic, social and demographic statistics (c) Streamlined activity patterns of statistical work between international organizations through elimination of overlaps and gaps (c) (i) Percentage of joint activities in the ECE statistical programme undertaken in cooperation with OECD, the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat) and other international organizations (ii) Number of international organizations regularly reporting their activities in the Integrated Presentation of International Statistical Work programmes (d) Increased access by users to reliable, timely and comparable macroeconomic, social and demographic statistics (d) Percentage of users that express satisfaction with the quality, coverage and timeliness of data delivered 16.13 The Statistics Division will review existing institutional frameworks (statistical laws) and major practices in member countries and positively influence eventual revisions. It will use recommendations made through technical cooperation activities such as bilateral advice to countries and multilateral workshops and seminars to accomplish this objective. 16.14 The subprogramme will continue to improve the comparability of official statistics in the ECE region. This will be achieved through reviewing and updating, jointly with other international organizations, the existing statistical standards and developing new ones, when necessary. As an integral part of its strategy, statistical assistance will be provided to the less developed countries of the region so that they can produce essential macroeconomic, social and demographic statistics, including the indicators for achieving the goals contained in the Millennium Declaration. Furthermore, through the mechanisms established by the Conference of European Statistics, the emerging needs of official statistics will be addressed collectively by all international organizations active in the region. For this to be achieved it is essential that the coordination role of the Conference of European Statistics vis-à-vis the statistical activities of international organizations, including the Statistical Office of European Communities (Eurostat), OECD, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Statistics Division of the Secretariat and CIS, be kept and further strengthened. ECE will, therefore, continue to compile updated information on the statistical activities of the various international organizations and make it publicly available. 16.15 The ECE strategy in statistics also applies to the production and dissemination of internationally comparable statistical data on the ECE region, with the aim of contributing to the public debate and decision-making process at the national and international level. Cooperation with other international organizations in collecting and sharing essential statistical data from national statistical offices and making efficient use of modern technologies for collection, processing and dissemination of statistics is a key part of this strategy. Subprogramme 4 Economic analysis Objective of the Organization: To enhance policy-making on major economic and development problems faced by countries of the ECE region and contribute to achieving the internationally agreed development goals of the United Nations. (a) Increased understanding of economic developments and policies in the ECE region, including in the areas relating to the internationally agreed development goals of the United Nations (a) (i) Percentage of users of the Economic Survey indicating usefulness and relevance of the policy recommendations to policy makers related to major economic developments (ii) Increase in the number of downloads from the ECE web site of ECE economic analyses addressing policy issues (b) Enhanced policy debates on economic and development issues, including those relating to core United Nations themes (such as the goals contained in the Millennium Declaration, financing for development, sustainable development, ageing, and gender equality) (b) Percentage of participants who express satisfaction with policy debates organized by Economic Analysis Division 16.16 The substantive responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Economic Analysis Division. 16.17 The subprogramme will first seek to provide an international and regional perspective for national economic policy makers and, when appropriate, facilitate policy dialogue. The Economic Survey of Europe will be used as a medium for producing analysis of economic issues, policies and problems in the ECE region, especially as they relate to core United Nations themes in the field of development. The Survey will continue to place special emphasis on the less advanced economies, with a view to helping them catch up with other countries of the region and the rest of the world. It is intended to strengthen the focus on structural change and institutional problems both in the Survey and at the ECE spring seminar. 16.18 Secondly, the subprogramme will coordinate and contribute to the work as agreed in the memorandum of understanding with OSCE and the established work plan. 16.19 Through the spring seminar and other meetings, ECE will provide a forum for policy debates on major and topical economic issues among senior economists from the government, academic and business sectors and from other international organizations. The population-related activities will be carried out in close collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), other international organizations and national institutions. Using reliable data from national and international sources, including population censuses and household/ family surveys, the subprogramme will conduct analyses, research and exchange of experiences relating to areas approved by the Commission for regional follow-up to the International Conference on Population and Development, the Fourth World Conference on Women, the second World Assembly on Ageing and the ECE Ministerial Conference on Ageing, held in Berlin. Subprogramme 5 Sustainable energy Objective of the Organization: To facilitate (a) the transition to a more sustainable development path for the production and use of energy; and (b) the fuller integration of the energy economies and energy infrastructure of countries in the region. (a) Progress in the international dialogue between Governments and industry on sustainable energy development issues, in particular environmental improvement, and in the formation of an energy efficiency market in countries with economies in transition (a) (i) Percentage of participants in policy discussions who evaluate them as being useful for decision-making (ii) Number of respondents that reply positively to the web-based evaluation survey on the use of ECE technical studies on sustainable energy and energy efficiency (iii) Increased number of energy efficiency investment projects for countries with economies in transition approved for financing (b) Further extension and implementation of ECE recommendations/guidelines and instruments for sustainable energy development (b) (i) Number of countries extending the application of United Nations Framework Classification for Energy Reserves/ Resources (UNFC) to oil, gas and uranium (ii) Number of mineral, energy and banking institutions and associations accepting and using the UNFC (c) Progress in implementation of projects in support of sustainable energy development in coal, natural gas, electricity and energy efficiency (c) (i) Number of prefeasibility study business plans for clean coal technology investment projects prepared under the United Nations Development Account project in Central Asia (ii) Tons of diesel fuel replaced by natural gas in commercial vehicles on the Blue Corridor Project road transport itinerary across Europe 16.20 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Industrial Restructuring, Energy and Enterprise Development Division. In the framework of the global initiatives towards sustainable development, this subprogramme is designed to promote a sustainable energy development strategy for the ECE region. In particular, it is to assist Member States in maintaining access to high quality energy services for all individuals in the ECE region, promote the security of energy supplies in the short, medium and long term, facilitate the transition to a more sustainable energy future and promote the fuller integration of the energy economies and energy infrastructures of countries in the ECE region. ECE will promote well-balanced energy network systems throughout the region tailored to optimize operating efficiencies and overall regional cooperation and sustained improvements in energy efficiency, production and use, particularly in countries with economies in transition. The subprogramme will support projects, especially on gas infrastructure and transportation networks, with particular attention to the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Balkans and Southern Europe. In the context of post-enlargement European Union, the subprogramme is to assist Member States with the integration of their energy economies through the compatibility of legal, regulatory and policy measures, including business practices and the development of classification systems and guidelines, and to conduct studies on natural gas markets. The subprogramme takes into account the goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and the proposals emanating from the process on strengthening the Organization initiated by the Secretary-General in 2002. 16.21 In order to meet the objectives, ECE will work through its intergovernmental bodies, with the active participation of government officials and representatives of the energy industries, the financial community, relevant international organizations and NGOs. It will coordinate its activities with other international organizations such as the International Energy Agency and the Energy Charter, with a view to ensuring efficient and effective use of resources and avoiding duplication. The present structure of intergovernmental dialogue through a committee, expert groups and technical assistance projects will be reinforced by additional extrabudgetary resources which the ECE sustainable energy activities usually attract. The international cooperation pursued by ECE bodies will have its greatest impact in this field by focusing on the key issues that strengthen national policies by providing a coherent regional context for managing inherently international problems. While activities begin with policy dialogue, the subprogramme also provides the opportunity for policy recommendations to be implemented through international norms, standards, training programmes, technical assistance and the preparation of investment projects. Subprogramme 6 Trade development Objective of the Organization: To facilitate trade and economic cooperation among countries of the ECE region and with the rest of the world. (a) Adoption by Member States of new/revised trade facilitation recommendations, norms, standards, guidelines and tools, including for agricultural produce (a) (i) The number of new and/or updated ECE recommendations, norms, standards, guidelines and tools for trade facilitation and electronic business agreed upon by Member States (ii) The number of agreed new or revised international standards and recommendations on agricultural produce (b) Increased implementation of trade facilitation recommendations, norms, standards, guidelines and tools, including for agricultural produce (b) (i) Increase in the number of recommendations, norms, standards, guidelines and tools implemented by Member States (ii) Number of downloads of key recommendations, norms, standards, guidelines and tools from the ECE Internet site, as a proxy for their use (iii) The cumulative total number of implementations of ECE agricultural quality standards in Member States (total number of standards multiplied by total number of countries implementing them) (c) Enhanced policy dialogue on trade practices and regulatory framework (c) Percentage of participants in policy discussions who evaluate them as being useful for decision-making 16.22 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Trade Development and Timber Division. The strategy will promote five key work areas. First, developing and maintaining international trade facilitation instruments in response to the needs of international business, especially to support international supply chains and the integration of countries into the global economy, and to provide a platform for discussion among all actors (Governments, business and other organizations) in this regard. This will entail maintaining electronic data interchange standards (United Nations Directories for Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport (UN/EDIFACT)), extending the work of the Organization on electronic codes and developing new e-business standards. Second, the strategy will focus on reducing barriers to trade in goods and services, especially non-tariff barriers, through greater implementation of ECE norms, standards and recommendations in trade facilitation, international harmonization and standardization and regulatory compatibility. Third, efforts will be made to facilitate trade policy development, especially in the context of the implications of the enlargement of the European Union, the new challenges stemming from trade and security and measures to promote sustainable trade. Fourth, the strategy will seek to add value to ECE's well-established work in agricultural quality standards and to encourage the participation of more countries throughout the ECE region in the standards-making process. Fifth, the ECE will encourage implementation of the trade-related norms and standards, in particular for the benefit of countries with economies in transition. Overall, efforts will be made to support the mainstreaming of information and communication technologies and gender issues into all aspects of the subprogramme. Subprogramme 7 Timber Objective of the Organization: To improve sustainable forest management, including the sound, legal use of wood, other forest products and services throughout the ECE region. (a) Increased understanding of sustainable forest management, notably the policies necessary to achieve it, based on increased ability to measure sustainable forest management at the national and regional levels (a) (i) Percentage of ECE countries with national forest programmes or similar holistic forest sector policy frameworks (ii) Percentage of ECE countries able to provide satisfactory data on indicators of sustainable forest management to the fifth Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (b) Increased understanding of the sound use of wood, leading to policies to promote it and increased ability to monitor it (b) (i) Percentage of ECE countries with policies in place on sound use of wood, whether as part of national forest programmes or not (ii) Percentage of ECE countries able to provide satisfactory responses to the ECE/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/International Tropical Timber Organization/Eurostat joint forest sector questionnaire (c) Increased capacity of countries in CIS and south-east Europe to achieve sustainable forest management at the national level, notably through developing appropriate policy measures (c) Increased number of CIS and south-east European countries adopting national forest programmes 16.23 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Trade Development and Timber Division. To support forest management, including the use of wood and forest products, which is sustainable from the ecological, economic and social point of view, it is necessary to maintain a good balance between these three aspects, based on a strong consensus about goals and methods among all stakeholders, as well as to ensure that the strategy is well integrated into the policy framework of other sectors (the cross-sectoral approach). Achieving sustainable forest management is primarily a sovereign national responsibility. However, regional international cooperation, through the timber subprogramme and its partners, will contribute by developing and disseminating concepts and information, sharing experience and defining standard measurement tools (indicators). The main contribution of the subprogramme is through developing and applying analytical and monitoring tools, both on policy and on developments on the ground, collecting, validating and disseminating information and analysis, as well as stimulating the exchange of experience and joint efforts to measure progress. While all countries benefit from international cooperation, the subprogramme recognizes a special need of the countries of CIS and south-east Europe, where forest sector problems tend to be more acute and national capacity weaker. Subprogramme 8 Human settlements Objective of the Organization: To improve the human settlements situation in the ECE region, taking into account the needs of socially vulnerable population groups and the gender perspective in sustainable urban development. (a) Improved housing sector policies through implementation of recommendations, taking into account the concerns of vulnerable population groups (a) (i) Number of countries which have expressed willingness to engage in an assessment of their housing situation through the country profile programme (ii) Percentage of recommendations that have been implemented in key areas by the countries that have taken part in land administration reviews, as reported to the Committee on Human Settlements (b) Further development and reforms in land administration (b) (i) Number of countries that have expressed willingness to engage in an assessment of their land administration systems through land administration reviews (ii) Percentage of recommendations that have been implemented by the reviewed countries, as reported to the Committee on Human Settlements (c) Improved policy formulation for urban planning (c) Number of countries that have taken action to implement the guidelines on urban planning, as reported to the Committee on Human Settlements 16.24 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Environment and Human Settlements Division. The activities of the subprogramme will promote the implementation of the ECE Strategy for Sustainable Quality of Life in Human Settlements in the 21st Century and will address the goals contained in the Millennium Declaration (eradication of extreme poverty, promotion of gender equality, ensuring of environmental sustainability) as well as the regional priorities for human settlements as decided upon at the first Regional Implementation Forum on Sustainable Development, held as follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development. In line with these directions, the activities of the subprogramme will promote socially, economically and environmentally sound human settlements policies. Through capacity-building measures, the dissemination of good practices and the provision of expert assistance to countries, the subprogramme will contribute to improving housing and urban planning policies and moving those policies in a more sustainable direction, particularly through upgrading land and real estate systems, promoting social housing for vulnerable population groups, including incorporation of the gender perspective, and improving urban land use for, inter alia, sustainable transport and energy consumption. Subprogramme 9 Industrial restructuring and enterprise development Objective of the Organization: To foster industrial restructuring and the development of effective and competitive enterprises, particularly in countries with economies in transition. (a) Enhanced policy dialogue on industrial restructuring and modernization, including promotion of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of knowledge-based economies based on national e-assessment reports identifying gaps and corresponding policy recommendations (a) (i) Percentage of policy recommendations resulting from national e-assessment reports that have been implemented by the countries reviewed (ii) Number of business incubators generated by ECE activities related to industrial development (b) Enhanced policies and practices for investment promotion (b) (i) Percentage of policy recommendations implemented in countries with economies in transition in the areas of investment promotion that are addressed by ECE activities (ii) Number of initiatives/actions aimed at promoting investment undertaken by countries and generated by ECE activities in these areas 16.25 The responsibility for this subprogramme is vested in the Industrial Restructuring, Energy and Enterprise Development Division. In order to meet the above objective, the Division intends to operate within and strengthen the already established network of officials responsible for enterprise restructuring and development within ministries of economy, trade, industry and finance and the major financial and non-financial public and private corporations. In particular, through enhancing policy dialogue and exchange of experiences among policy makers, experts and private sector representatives, ECE will assist Member States, upon request, in dealing with key challenges such as: the promotion of domestic and foreign investment; the creation of an environment conducive to transforming the old industries into new ones that are products of the newly emerging knowledge-based economy; the promotion of institutions facilitating new business undertakings, including business incubators, that support innovative small and medium-sized enterprises; and the strengthening of the regulatory and institutional framework for enterprise development as one important aspect of the economic dimension of security. In this way, the most pressing and relevant industrial restructuring and modernization issues will be properly addressed in intergovernmental cooperation and debate. At the same time, this course of action will foster the development and implementation of concerned national policies. Where appropriate and necessary, training and education of policy makers in implementing business development strategies and creating modern institutions for promoting entrepreneurship will also be undertaken. Notes 1 At its annual session in February 2004, the Economic Commission for Europe decided to commission a comprehensive report on the state of the Commission with the aim of avoiding duplication and ensuring cooperation, complementarity and efficiencies among intergovernmental organizations. The report will be submitted to the next annual session of the Commission in February 2005.
