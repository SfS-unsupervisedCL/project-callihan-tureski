(Programme 21 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005) 25.1 The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is responsible for the implementation of the programme of work under this section. The General Assembly established the Office in its resolution 319 A (IV) of 3 December 1949 and approved the Statute in resolution 428 (V) on 14 December 1950. In subsequent resolutions, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Executive Committee of the Programme of the High Commissioner have called upon the Office, in the context of its basic mandate, to assist other groups of persons regarded as falling within the competence of the High Commissioner. 25.2 The overall objective of UNHCR is to assist Governments to provide international protection to refugees and to seek durable solutions to refugee problems. UNHCR is required by its mandate to safeguard the fundamental principle of non-refoulement, and the institution of asylum, and to ensure that the basic rights of refugees are respected and that they are treated in a decent and humane manner. As regards UNHCR assistance activities, the General Assembly, in its resolution 832 (IX) of 21 October 1954, expanded the basic provisions of the Statute. In subsequent resolutions, the Assembly called upon the High Commissioner to provide assistance to returnees and to monitor their safety and well-being on return to their countries of origin. 25.3 Furthermore, based on specific requests from the Secretary-General or the competent principal organs of the United Nations and with the consent of the States concerned, UNHCR provides humanitarian assistance and protection to internally displaced persons, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/116 of 20 December 1993. In complex humanitarian emergencies, in addition to discharging its particular international protection mandate, UNHCR also contributes to the provision of humanitarian assistance within the framework of a United Nations system-wide coordinated response, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991. 25.4 In its resolution 57/186 of 18 December 2002, the General Assembly renewed the mandate of UNHCR for a further period of five years, from 1 January 2004. Consistent with the revised medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005, during the coming biennium UNHCR would continue to carry out its functions within the framework of two subprogrammes, that is, international protection and assistance. The programme of work will focus on the implementation of the Agenda for Protection, adopted by the Executive Committee of the Programme of the High Commissioner at its fifty-third session, held at Geneva from 30 September to 4 October 2002 (A/57/12/Add.1, annex IV). 25.5 The work of UNHCR for the coming biennium will be shaped further by the policy goals set out by the High Commissioner in his report to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session (A/57/12 and Add.1). In its resolution 57/186, the General Assembly decided to consider at its fifty-eighth session the proposals of the High Commissioner, which were prepared in consultation with the Executive Committee and the Secretary-General with the aim of strengthening the capacity of the Office to carry out its mandate. 25.6 The High Commissioner's proposals aim at improving the governance of UNHCR and at strengthening the Office as a multilateral institution. Other issues include broader funding arrangements and the position of UNHCR within the United Nations system, especially the need to ensure greater collaboration, coordination and strengthened partnerships. 25.7 The key governance structure of UNHCR is the Executive Committee, which was established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 1166 (XII) of 26 November 1957 to advise the High Commissioner in the exercise of his/her functions and to approve the use of extrabudgetary funds made available to the High Commissioner. The annual cycle of meetings of the Executive Committee consists of one annual plenary session and a number of inter-sessional meetings of the Standing Committee. The membership of the Executive Committee is expanding, and now stands at 64. Reports on the Executive Committee's sessions are submitted to the General Assembly as addenda to the reports of the High Commissioner. 25.8 The High Commissioner provides the overall direction, supervision and management of the activities under this programme. The High Commissioner is elected by the General Assembly on the nomination of the Secretary-General. The functions of the High Commissioner are set out in the annex to the Statute of UNHCR. The High Commissioner is assisted by a Deputy High Commissioner and an Assistant High Commissioner. 25.9 The expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement of UNHCR during the biennium 2004-2005 and the related resource requirements for the implementation of the work programme are indicated hereunder. Table 25.1 shows the framework of the expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement. Table 25.1 Framework of expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement by component Component Number of expected accomplishments Number of indicators of achievement International protection Assistance Total 25.10 The regular budget resources proposed for the biennium 2004-2005 under this section amount to $48,456,000, representing an increase of $2,500,000, or 5.4 per cent, over the revised appropriation for the current biennium. The increase is proposed to strengthen the regular budget component of the High Commissioner's administrative expenditures, which, in accordance with Article 20 of the Statute of UNHCR, is financed under the regular budget. The regular budget's share of the total projected resources of UNHCR for 2004-2005 amount to 2.6 per cent. 25.11 Table 25.3 below shows the proposed overall level of resources under this section, while table 25.4 indicates the number of posts by funding sources, both for the current biennium and those proposed for the biennium 2004-2005. 25.12 The issue of publications as a part of the programme of work has been reviewed in the context of each subprogramme. It is anticipated that recurrent and non-recurrent publications will be issued as shown below in summary and as distributed in the output information for each subprogramme.

UNHCR operations are grouped into the following regions: Africa; Europe; the Americas; Asia and the Pacific; and Central Asia, South-West Asia, North Africa and the Middle East. In support of those operations, UNHCR undertakes its activities through 120 country offices. Country representatives act on behalf of the High Commissioner and are accountable to him/her for their activities in the country or countries to which they are accredited. Subprogramme 1 25.14 The activities to be implemented under this subprogramme are under the overall responsibility of the Department of International Protection. The programme of work is formulated by drawing upon subprogramme 1 of programme 21 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005.

Table 25.7 Resource requirements Resources (thousands of United States dollars) Posts (before recosting) Post Non-post 25.20 In accordance with article 20 of the Statute of UNHCR, administrative expenditures relating to the functioning of UNHCR are borne under the regular budget of the United Nations, and all other expenditures relating to the activities of UNHCR are financed by voluntary contributions. While the Statute does not define what is meant by "administrative expenditures", the term, based on a definition offered by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in a report submitted to the Assembly at its seventh session (see A/2157, part III), has been interpreted to mean expenses other than operational expenses and the related management costs. 25.21 The amount of $48,456,000 proposed for the biennium 2004-2005 relates to: (a) provisions for posts of the High Commissioner and the Deputy High Commissioner ($778,700) and (b) a grant of $47,677,300 to be utilized towards the administrative costs of UNHCR. The level of the grant includes an increase of $2,500,000 to continue to strengthen the regular budget component of the administrative expenditures of UNHCR following the completion of the redefinition and recategorization of UNHCR posts as was envisaged in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/6 (Sect. 23), para. 23.19). The provision of funds to UNHCR for the administrative expenditures of the Office of the High Commissioner in the form of a grant rather than as posts was initiated in the biennium 2002-2003. It was designed to simplify the UNHCR budgetary process and would be subject to review after three bienniums, as indicated in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (ibid., para. 23.20).
