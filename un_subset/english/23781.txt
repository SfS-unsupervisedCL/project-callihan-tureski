UNITED NATIONS E Economic and Social Council Distr. Original: COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS Sixtieth session Item 8 of the provisional agenda QUESTION OF THE VIOLATION OF human rights IN THE OCCUPIED ARAB TERRITORIES, INCLUDING PALESTINE Letter dated 21 October 2003 from the Permanent Observer for Palestine to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed to the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights While Israeli occupation authorities persist in perpetrating all kinds of violations of the principles of human rights all over the Occupied Palestinian Territories, occupied by Israel since 1967, including Jerusalem, and while the Israeli massacre continues unabated for the thirteenth consecutive day in Rafah town and camp to the south of the occupied Gaza Strip, causing death and injury to dozens of Palestinians, including men, women and children, the destruction of over 135 homes, and displacement of hundreds of Palestinian families who became homeless, Israeli F-16 fighter jets and Apache gunships carried out five Israeli air strikes inside Gaza city and at the entrance to alNusseirat refugee camp in the centre of Gaza city yesterday, Monday, 20 October 2003, killing 12 Palestinian civilians, including a doctor, and wounding over 100 others including children, some of them seriously. Israeli massacres against Palestinians, mass killing, collective punishment, collective siege, massive house demolition and mass displacement of families at the hands of Israeli troops against Palestinians persist, meaning that Israel as well as its occupation authorities are insistent on perpetrating flagrant violations of human rights, the principles of international law and international humanitarian law. This is done in total disobedience of the will of the international community and Commission on Human Rights resolutions, encouraged in so doing by complete impunity and the absence of any international deterrent. GE.03-16534 (E) 071103 101103 In the light of this continued massacre, we renew our appeal to the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Chair of the Commission on Human Rights immediately to intervene and urge the Government of Israel to stop without delay its onslaught and continued massacres against the Palestinian people, and to comply with the principles of human rights, international humanitarian law and Commission on Human Rights resolutions in this respect. I would be most grateful if you could have this letter distributed as an official document of the sixtieth session of the Commission on Human Rights, under its agenda item 8.
