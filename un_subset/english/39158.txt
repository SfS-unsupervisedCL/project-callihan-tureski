Expresses its intention to keep the mandate and structures of UNIFIL under regular review, taking into account the prevailing situation on the ground, the activities actually performed by the force in its area of operation, its contribution towards the remaining task of restoring international peace and security, the views of the Lebanese Government and the measures it has taken to fully extend its authority in the South as well as the implications these measures may have, in order to adjust the force to its mission; 16.
