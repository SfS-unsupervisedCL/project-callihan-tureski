Letter dated 23 May 2007 from the President of the Security Council to the Secretary-General Addendum At its 5681st meeting, on 23 May 2007, the Security Council endorsed the proposal of the Secretary-General, contained in his letter dated 7 May 2007 to the President of the Security Council (S/2007/300), and agreed that the President of the Council should send to the Secretary-General, in reply, the draft letter before the Council at that meeting, which was subsequently issued as document S/2007/301, dated 23 May 2007. The proposal contained in the Secretary-General's letter of 7 May 2007 and approved by the Security Council on 23 May 2007 was that, pursuant to the letter dated 19 February 2007 addressed to the Secretary-General by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq (S/2007/300, annex), an amount from the balance in the account of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission be transferred to settle the arrears of the Government of Iraq to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and to meet its current obligation with respect to the regular, peacekeeping and capital master plan budgets and the budgets of the International Tribunals for Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia. It has now been determined that the amounts to be transferred in implementation of the proposal of the Secretary-General, as approved by the Security Council in the letter of reply from the President of the Security Council (S/2007/301) should read Euro1,874,094 and $772,234, rather than Euro1,856,754 and $694,771, respectively.
