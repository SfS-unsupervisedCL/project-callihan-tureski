UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1997/1021 31 December 1997 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 24 DECEMBER 1997 FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1141 (1997) of 28 November 1997, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH). Having completed the customary consultations, I propose that the mission be composed of police personnel from the following Member States: Argentina, Benin, Canada, France, India, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Tunisia and United States of America. All of these States have expressed their readiness to make the necessary personnel available. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Kofi A. ANNAN
