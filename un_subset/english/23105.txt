Thus, the important stage of the legal formalization of the state border of Ukraine has been completed. The signing of the Treaty signifies a new page in the century-old history of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples. It expands the possibility for the further development of relations between Ukraine and the Russian Federation as independent sovereign States and good neighbours. Our peoples have confirmed their desire to base their relationship on friendship, co-operation and partnership, thereby having contributed to the cause of strengthening the European security. The Treaty will contribute to the establishment of a high level of mutual understanding and confidence, civilized resolution of disputable issues that may arise between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. This endeavour is a milestone for further co-operation in settling the existing problems and a precondition for their resolution in the interests of both Parties. To this aim, Ukraine will continue to endeavour to complete the legal formalisation of the state border along its entire perimeter.
