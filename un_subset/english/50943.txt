Active in over 40 countries, and representing partnerships between hundreds of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), the Alliance acts as a link between local responses and global policies. The Alliance currently operates under a strategic framework for the period 2008-2010, with the following four (4) key goals: (i) scale up quality responses; (ii) strengthen civil society to respond to HIV; (iii) improve HIV policies; (iv) build an effective Alliance. These goals represent a streamlined reiteration and development of the strategic directions for 2005-2007, covering the majority of the period of this report, which were: (i) Increase coverage of effective community focused HIV and AIDS action; (ii) Strengthen the leadership and capacity of civil society to enable it to participate effectively in national responses to HIV and AIDS; (iii) Influence the national and international policy and financial environment to enable more effective civil society responses to HIV and AIDS; (iv) Build up an alliance of national linking organisations working effectively together. Total expenditure across the Alliance family of organisations grew from United States' (US) $35.8 million in 2004 to US$61.8 million in 2007. Significant funding source trends over the period include a growing amount and proportion of funding from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, from Nordic governments and from the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 2007 saw a significant growth in funding accessed directly by Alliance members incountry, reflecting increased organisational capacity among members of the Alliance partnership.

The Alliance's trustees proposed a change in objects in 2007, expanding the links with sexual and reproductive health and human rights and bringing the Alliance's objects into line with current activity and global needs. The original objects were: to promote the relief of persons who are suffering from HIV/AIDS; and to advance the education of the public concerning the symptoms, prevention and consequences of HIV/AIDS.
