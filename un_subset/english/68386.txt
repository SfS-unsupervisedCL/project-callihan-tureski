Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 18 December 2013 [on the report of the Third Committee (A/68/456/Add.2)] 68/180. Protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons The General Assembly, Recalling that internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border, Recognizing that internally displaced persons are to enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms under international and domestic law as do other persons in their country, Deeply disturbed by the alarmingly high numbers of internally displaced persons throughout the world, for reasons including armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights and natural or human-made disasters, who receive inadequate protection and assistance, and conscious of the serious challenges that this is creating for the international community, Recognizing that natural disasters are a cause of internal displacement, and concerned about factors, such as climate change, that are expected to exacerbate the impact of natural hazards and climate-related events, Recognizing also that the consequences of hazards can be prevented or substantially mitigated by integrating disaster risk reduction strategies into national development policies and programmes, Conscious of the human rights, humanitarian and development dimensions, as well as the possible peacebuilding dimension, of internal displacement, including in long-term displacement situations, the often heightened vulnerability of women and children as well as persons with disabilities and the responsibilities of States and the international community to strengthen further their protection and assistance, Emphasizing that States have the primary responsibility to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction, as well as to address the root causes of the displacement problem in appropriate cooperation with the international community, Reaffirming that all persons, including those internally displaced, have the right to freedom of movement and residence and should be protected against arbitrary displacement, Noting the international community's growing awareness of the issue of internally displaced persons worldwide, including the millions living in protracted situations of displacement, many of them outside camp settings in urban areas, and the urgency of providing adequate humanitarian assistance to and protection of internally displaced persons and support to local host communities, addressing the root causes of displacement and finding durable solutions for internally displaced persons in their countries, including voluntary return in safety and with dignity, as well as voluntary local integration in the areas to which persons have been displaced or voluntary settlement in another part of the country, without prejudice to the right of internally displaced persons to leave their country or to seek asylum, Recalling the relevant norms of international law, including international human rights law, international humanitarian law and international refugee law, and recognizing that the protection of internally displaced persons has been strengthened by identifying, reaffirming and consolidating specific standards for their protection, in particular through the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, Recalling also the relevance of international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977, as a vital legal framework for the protection of and assistance to civilians in armed conflict and under foreign occupation, including internally displaced persons, Welcoming the increasing dissemination, promotion, application and integration into domestic laws and policies of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement when dealing with situations of internal displacement, Deploring practices of forced displacement and their negative consequences for the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by large groups of populations, and recalling the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court that define the deportation or forcible transfer of population as a crime against humanity and the unlawful deportation, transfer or ordering of the displacement of the civilian population as war crimes, Expressing its appreciation to those Governments and intergovernmental, regional and non-governmental organizations that have supported and facilitated the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, and of his predecessor, the former Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons and, according to their roles and responsibilities, have helped to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons, Welcoming the continuing cooperation between the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons and national Governments and the relevant offices and agencies of the United Nations as well as with other international and regional organizations, and encouraging further strengthening of this collaboration in order to promote better strategies for, protection of, assistance to and durable solutions for internally displaced persons, Acknowledging with appreciation the important and independent contribution of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and other humanitarian agencies in protecting and assisting internally displaced persons, in cooperation with national Governments and relevant international bodies, Welcoming the priorities set by the Special Rapporteur as contained in his report to the Human Rights Council at its sixteenth session and the two strategic objectives of supporting Governments in developing national instruments on internal displacement and facilitating viable durable solutions for internally displaced persons, including through the engagement of development actors, Recalling the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, regarding the need to develop global strategies to address the problem of internal displacement, and recalling also all relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council, Recalling also its resolution 66/165 of 19 December 2011 and Human Rights Council resolutions 20/9 of 5 July 2012 and 23/8 of 13 June 2013, 1.

Commends the Special Rapporteur for the activities undertaken so far, for the catalytic role that he plays in raising the level of awareness about the plight of internally displaced persons and for his ongoing efforts to address their development and other specific needs, including through the mainstreaming of the human rights of internally displaced persons into all relevant parts of the United Nations system; 3. Encourages the Special Rapporteur, through continuous dialogue with Governments and all intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations concerned, to continue his analysis of the root causes of internal displacement and of the needs and human rights of those displaced, measures of prevention, including early warning, and ways to strengthen protection and assistance, as well as durable solutions for internally displaced persons, and, in the latter regard, to use in his activities the Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, and also encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to promote comprehensive strategies, taking into account the primary responsibility of States for the protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction; 4. Recognizes the adverse effects of climate change as contributors to environmental degradation and extreme weather events, which may, among other factors, contribute to human displacement, and encourages the Special Rapporteur, in close collaboration with States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to continue to explore the human rights implications and dimensions of disaster-induced internal displacement, with a view to supporting Member States in their efforts to build local resilience and capacity to prevent displacement or to provide assistance and protection to those who are forced to flee; 5. Calls upon States to provide durable solutions, including within their national development plans, and encourages strengthened international cooperation, in particular between humanitarian and development actors, including through the provision of resources and expertise to assist affected countries, in particular developing countries, in their national efforts and policies related to assistance, protection and rehabilitation for internally displaced persons and the integration of the human rights and needs of internally displaced persons into both rural and urban development strategies, as well as the participation of both internally displaced persons and host communities in the design and implementation of those strategies; 6. Expresses particular concern that many internally displaced children, particularly girls, lack access to education in all phases of displacement owing to attacks against schools, damaged or destroyed school buildings, insecurity, loss of documentation, language barriers and discrimination, and calls upon States, in cooperation with all other relevant actors, including humanitarian and development agencies and donors, to ensure the right to a quality education, including primary and secondary education, for internally displaced children, without discrimination of any kind, as well as to support existing schools to enable them to include internally displaced persons, and calls upon parties to armed conflict to respect the civilian character of schools and other educational institutions and to refrain from undertaking actions that could adversely affect the protection of these buildings against direct attacks; 7.
