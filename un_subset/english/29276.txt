Letter dated 12 January 2004 from the Permanent Representative of Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to draw your attention to the statement on the death penalty in Myanmar issued in Rome on 31 December 2003 by the Italian Presidency on behalf of the European Union (see annex). I should be grateful if the text of the present letter and its annex could be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Richard Ryan Permanent Representative of Ireland to the United Nations [Original: English and French] Statement on the death penalty in Myanmar issued in Rome on 31 December 2003 by the Italian Presidency on behalf of the European Union The European Union is deeply concerned about the nine death sentences issued on 28 November 2003 by the Myanmar authorities. The European Union expressed its grave concern in a d√©marche with the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs carried out by the Presidency on 12 December 2003. The European Union believes that the death penalty is a contravention of the right to life and of human dignity, and it is therefore committed to working towards its universal abolition. The European Union urges all States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure full respect for international safeguards, in particular the minimum procedural guarantees for a fair trial contained in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty set out in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984. The acceding countries Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, the associated countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey and the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, align themselves with this statement.
