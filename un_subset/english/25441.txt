Thirteenth Meeting New York, 9-13 June 2003 Decision on budgetary matters of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for 2003 1. In the event that the Tribunal is unable to meet approved expenditures for 2003 from appropriations made with respect to the budget lines "Established posts" and "Common staff costs", the Meeting of States Parties authorizes the Registrar to incur expenditures to the extent that the shortfall in appropriations results from unforeseeable increases in daily subsistence allowance (DSA), salary costs and common costs, as applied within the United Nations common system. 2. In the event that the Tribunal is unable to meet approved expenditures for 2003 from appropriations made in the budget line "Maintenance of premises", the Meeting of States Parties authorizes the Registrar to incur expenditures to the extent that the shortfall in appropriations results from exchange rate fluctuations. 3. The Meeting of States Parties authorizes the Tribunal to finance the over-expenditures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 by transfers between appropriation sections as far as possible and, if necessary, by using the savings from the financial period 2002. 4. The Meeting of States Parties further decides that the Registrar shall report to the fourteenth Meeting of States Parties on any action taken pursuant to paragraph 3, together with the circumstances relating thereto.
