The Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) was established by General Assembly resolution 48/218B, dated 29 July 1994, to enhance oversight in the United Nations. Operationally independent, the Office is to assist the Secretary-General in fulfilling his internal oversight responsibilities in respect of the resources and staff of the United Nations through internal audit, monitoring, inspection, evaluation and investigation. 2. The Internal Audit Division (IAD) of OIOS is providing internal audit services to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) under the provisions of Article 12 of the Financial Rules for the Voluntary Funds administered by UNHCR. The article states that all financial transactions and related activities covered by these rules shall be subject to audit by the UNHCR Audit Section of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and by the United Nations Board of Auditors. Chapter 4 of the UNHCR Manual also has a section on internal audit to ensure that all staff are aware of and understand the nature of OIOS/IAD's work, which is primarily intended to assist the High Commissioner in fulfilling his management functions as well as to function as an oversight mechanism, providing reasonable assurance that UNHCR's resources are used properly. 3. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the UNHCR and OIOS defines the arrangements for internal audit services to be provided by OIOS/IAD to UNHCR. The first agreement was signed in April 1997. The MOU has been revisited at regular intervals to ensure that the services provided remain in line with UNHCR needs. The latest review, which took place in June 2009, was not yet finalized at the time this report was issued. 4. The present report provides an overview of internal audit activities during the period 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. It is submitted in conformity with the MOU, where it was agreed that, in consultation with the High Commissioner, OIOS/IAD would prepare an annual report on internal audit activities for submission to the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme. II. Audit activities A. Planning and reporting Annual planning exercise 5. An annual risk-based plan, covering the period January to December, was prepared in accordance with the planning process agreed with UNHCR. The planning process involved identification of high and medium risk assignments and discussions with UNHCR management and the UNHCR Oversight Committee to identify issues of concern that should be included and considered in finalizing the work plan. Monitoring arrangements 6. As agreed with UNHCR, OIOS/IAD provided the UNHCR Audit Coordination Unit with a monthly status report on work plan progress, which the Unit forwarded to UNHCR management and the UNHCR Oversight Committee. Productivity 7. During the reporting period, 30 audit reports were produced compared to 21 in the prior period. OIOS/IAD made improvements in meeting the agreed deadlines for finalizing audit reports, about which UNHCR had expressed concern to OIOS/IAD. OIOS/IAD also made use of staff from other audit sections to assist with audits, to mitigate the effects of vacancies. Coverage of UNHCR activities 8. OIOS/IAD audits covered the majority of the areas where UNHCR was operating (see Figure 1). The significant change from prior reporting periods was the increase in oversight of headquarters activities to cover issues affecting all operations, such as arrangements for delegation of authority to the field, security and safety and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Figure 1: Chart showing audit coverage of UNHCR activities during 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 B. Organization and staffing Organization of internal audit services 9. In recognition of the decentralization and regionalization strategy of UNHCR, OIOS/IAD, in discussion with UNHCR, reorganized the delivery of its services into three sections, two focusing on the field and one on headquarters activities. The field sections, based in Nairobi and Geneva, also support resident auditors located in areas strategic for UNHCR such as the Syrian Arab Republic, Sudan, Sri Lanka and Senegal. The location of resident auditors is not static and can change in response to UNHCR needs. For example, in 2009, there was a resident audit function in Georgia, but this position was no longer continued in view of the changed requirements. Staffing 10. Table 1 shows the number of approved posts. The significant change in this reporting period was the strengthening of the field section in Nairobi to better serve the region with the highest expenditures. In 2009, the regions covered by the Africa Bureau reported expenditures totalling $661 million, which represent 45 per cent of the total expenditures reported by all UNHCR regions in the same period. Table 1: Number and type of approved posts for 2009 and 2010 Geneva Nairobi Resident Auditors Professional General Service Funding 11. The budget for internal audit services provided by UNHCR totalled $3.8 million in 2009 and $4.2 million in 2010. The increase is largely due to the additional funding required to establish three new posts in Nairobi. OIOS/IAD is also pleased to note that its funding structure was changed during the period, in coordination with UNHCR, to bring more stability to funding the internal audit activities. This is especially true for resident auditors, who had previously been funded under an arrangement that placed reliance on the use of temporary staff, and it had become increasingly difficult to recruit suitable temporary staff in a reasonable timeframe. Vacancies 12. Vacancies remain an area of concern for both OIOS/IAD and UNHCR. The vacancy rate in the period July to December 2009 was 24 per cent, while the vacancy rate for the first half of 2010 was 49 per cent. The increase was mainly attributable to lengthy delays experienced in launching vacancy announcements for posts. The United Nations Office of Human Resources Management in New York launches OIOS/IAD posts and for requests made in January, the shortest launch time was three months, and one professional vacancy had still not been launched as of 30 June 2010. OIOS/IAD is taking urgent steps to fill these vacancies expeditiously. C. Cooperation and coordination UNHCR Oversight Committee 13. OIOS/IAD stated in its last report that the terms of reference (TOR) of the UNHCR Oversight Committee were changed in July 2008, but the new TOR still did not clearly establish modalities of interaction with OIOS/IAD. Discussions with UNHCR have taken place to clarify the relationship and expectations between OIOS/IAD and the Committee. These discussions were still ongoing at the time of issuing this report, and OIOS/IAD understands that a review of the composition of the Oversight Committee is planned. UNHCR oversight bodies 14. UNHCR oversight bodies include the Inspector General's Office (IGO), the Policy Development and Evaluation Service (PDES), and the Board of Auditors. During the reporting period, there was regular contact with the various oversight bodies, including sharing plans and holding regular dialogue. These arrangements were further strengthened with the introduction of quarterly oversight coordination meetings with IGO and PDES. Two meetings were held during the reporting period and the structure and format of these meetings is under discussion, including how the output from this group should be communicated to the UNHCR Oversight Committee. OIOS/IAD finds these discussions to be a valuable platform to exchange ideas and discuss issues, and sees this development as presenting an opportunity, not just to strengthen coordination, but also to identify emerging oversight issues that should be brought to the attention of senior management and the UNHCR Oversight Committee. OIOS/IAD hopes that this development will address concerns regarding the need to ensure that the respective roles and responsibilities of the oversight bodies are clear, and that there is effective coordination to minimize duplication and ensure adequate coverage of all key areas of UNHCR work. Audit focal point and coordination unit 15. During the reporting period, the Controller was the focal point for OIOS/IAD, and the majority of formal communications to UNHCR management were routed through the Controller and the Audit Coordination Unit, located in the Controller's office. OIOS/IAD would like to express its appreciation to the Controller and the Unit for the support provided during the reporting period. However, OIOS/IAD is discussing with UNHCR whether it might be more appropriate for the audit focal point to be with the Executive Management, which would bring it in line with IGO and PDES. In addition, placing the Audit Coordination Unit under Executive Management would facilitate more effective coordination of oversight activities. As a first step, OIOS/IAD began, in the reporting period, to send all formal audit communications to Executive Management. Client satisfaction survey 16. OIOS/IAD conducts an annual survey of clients. In the 2009 survey, UNHCR rated OIOS/IAD as good, on the quality of work performed by the internal auditors; and commented on the high vacancy rates, lack of consultative work, the need to increase OIOS/IAD field presence and the need for more risk language in reports. Apart from the vacancies, OIOS/IAD feels it has made progress in all of these areas as reported in the relevant sections of this report. D. Advisory services 17. The MOU with UNHCR states that OIOS/IAD will "to the extent that it does not conflict with OIOS's independence, provide advice to management, concerning, among other things, the interpretation of rules, policies or procedures". This is an area that UNHCR has indicated that it would like to see OIOS/IAD improve upon, and OIOS/IAD has indicated to UNHCR its willingness to assist, to the extent that it would not impair its ability to perform an audit in the area at a later date. 18. During the reporting period, OIOS/IAD was involved in an informal way in providing advice on the implementation of its recommendations, including the following: Proposed revision to UNHCR's financial rules: OIOS/IAD provided advice on the proposed changes, especially in comparison with the United Nations' financial regulations and rules; Affiliate workforce (non-regular staff): OIOS/IAD provided advice to assist in the implementation of recommendations made in the 2006 audit where OIOS/IAD highlighted that no legal basis or policy instrument existed in UNHCR that provided guidance and/or standardization for hiring personnel under non-regular service contracts; and Audit certification process: OIOS/IAD advised UNHCR on issues to think about when hiring a consultant to undertake a project to revise the audit certification process. III. Key findings A. Overview 19. The 30 reports issued during the period generated 323 recommendations, which addressed risks in the focus areas as shown in Figure 2, and as explained further in the remainder of this section. Figure 2: Recommendations by focus area B. Strategic management and governance 1. Need to enhance policy and procedures for handling misconduct by implementing partners 20. UNHCR does not have a policy or procedure for the de-listing and re-admission of implementing partners (IPs) that have violated the UNHCR Code of Conduct or committed fraud or other mismanagement. The scope of the investigating authority of the IGO does not cover the investigation of IPs suspected of misconduct. This is a grey area where the jurisdiction of UNHCR is not clear. The cases of misconduct involving UNHCR IPs, brought to the attention of the IGO, are referred either to the local authorities or to the IP's headquarters. UNHCR needs to develop a strategy for following up suspected cases of misconduct by third parties. UNHCR recognized the existence of a gap on this particular issue, which has been discussed by the UNHCR Oversight Committee. At the time of this report, discussions are still ongoing and no implementation date was available (AR2007/160/03, Audit of UNHCR's relationship with implementing partners - March 2010). 2. Need for improved structure and staffing arrangements for better management of the Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund 21. UNHCR agreed with OIOS/IAD that it needed to put in place adequate staffing arrangements and an organizational structure in the Representation in Sudan that would enable it to manage its participation in the Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund effectively and in a consistent manner, while keeping the related staffing costs at an acceptable level. UNHCR made provisions for additional staff in its 2011 budget and reviewed the organizational structure and division of labour (AR2009/115/04, Audit of UNHCR's arrangements for managing its participation in the Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund - May 2010). 3. Need to ensure alignment of organizational structures and functions to the revised roles and responsibilities under the cluster approach 22. To fulfil UNHCR's roles and responsibilities as a Global Cluster Lead for the three clusters of protection, emergency shelter and camp coordination and camp management, the High Commissioner had instructed that IDP issues should be mainstreamed into the work of UNHCR. UNHCR accepted OIOS/IAD's recommendation to conduct an internal review to ensure that all the roles and responsibilities as a result of the mainstreaming had been reallocated and no gaps in coverage existed. At the time of this report, the planned review had not yet started and UNHCR had not provided an implementation date for the recommendation (AR2009/160/04, Audit of UNHCR's arrangements for managing its role in the cluster approach for internally displaced persons - May 2010). C. Programme and project management 1. Need for guidance on remote monitoring arrangements for high security situations to improve effectiveness of programme monitoring 23. OIOS/IAD found that a deteriorating security situation in several countries forced UNHCR to turn to remote monitoring. However, there are no clear organizational operating policies and guidelines for remote monitoring. The use of remote monitoring techniques is an emerging issue that increasingly confronts UNHCR in new operations, due to security reasons and inaccessibility of some locations. To ensure a consistent approach, policies and guidelines on remote monitoring need to be developed. UNHCR embarked on a survey that resulted in a draft paper on remote management, which is being reviewed at UNHCR Headquarters with a view to eventually turning it into a set of guidelines. A date for the completion of this exercise was not provided to OIOS/IAD (AR2008/141/04, Audit of UNHCR operations in Afghanistan - August 2009). 2. Need to address some weaknesses relating to implementing partners 24. UNHCR does not have a consolidated set of procedures governing all phases of the IP selection process. This makes it difficult for UNHCR to monitor the selection of IPs or demonstrate that a consistent and transparent process was followed. UNHCR agreed to review and update the guidance on IP management, including selection procedures, which was planned to be completed by the end of 2010 (AR2009/121/01, Audit of UNHCR operations in Georgia: selection of implementing partners - December 2009). 25. A framework covering all components of IP capacity building is needed. Capacity building of IPs is mostly left to national and regional offices and is based on ad hoc training modules developed and implemented in the field. UNHCR has neither a common training strategy for IPs nor a mechanism to facilitate cooperation between international and national NGOs. UNHCR agreed and is in the process of establishing a framework on IP capacity building. The date for completion of this exercise was not known at the time of issuing this report (AR2007/160/03, Audit of UNHCR's relationship with implementing partners - March 2010). 26. Performance monitoring of IPs needs to be improved. Weaknesses identified in the monitoring of projects included: insufficient monitoring visits to IPs; limited evidence of planning and documentation of monitoring activities; absence of monitoring tools to ensure that all significant issues are adequately covered; negligible follow-up of previous recommendations; lack of knowledge and technical skills in accounting and internal control by the staff involved; and poor information sharing between units. OIOS/IAD noted that some representations made progress in their project monitoring function for instance, by creating a project control officer function or implementing a multi-functional approach to project monitoring. However, assistance from Headquarters is necessary to develop a standard verification approach adaptable to particularities existing in a large number of country operations. UNHCR is currently reviewing and updating the section on IPs in the UNHCR Manual, which was planned to be completed by the end of 2010 (AR2009/112/01, audit of UNHCR Operations in Ethiopia - August 2009; AR2009/121/03, Audit of the implementation of the shelter construction programme in the UNHCR operations in Georgia - April 2010; and AR2008/141/04, UNHCR operations in Afghanistan - August 2009). D. Supply chain management 1. Pre-qualification of implementing partners for complex procurement operations needs to be reviewed 27. OIOS/IAD encountered a situation where it concluded that an IP pre-qualified to conduct procurement on behalf of UNHCR lacked adequate procurement procedures to handle a complex procurement involving construction. UNHCR agreed that this highlighted a weakness in the current rules for pre-qualification and embarked on a review of its pre-qualification procedures and policy on the delegation of procurement activities to IPs at the global and local levels, which should be completed by end December 2010 (AR2009/121/03, Audit of the implementation of the shelter construction programme in the UNHCR operations in Georgia - April 2010). 2. Weak asset management in field operations 28. Audits conducted during the reporting period indicated that, in spite of the instructions on implementation of IPSAS, asset management remained a weak area in many UNHCR representations. The main internal control weaknesses reported on asset management were linked to the lack of physical checks and irregular update, the Managing for Systems, Resources and People (MSRP) enterprise resource planning software for asset movements. OIOS/IAD also found unclear supervision/oversight and training responsibilities and cases of late identification and disposal of unused assets. UNHCR representations took immediate action to implement the recommendations related to asset management: physical checks have been performed and asset records were updated when required. In some cases, additional resources, particularly staff, were allocated to the asset management function to improve asset management capacity (AR2008/141/04, audit of UNHCR operations in Afghanistan - August 2009; AR2009/111/02, Audit of UNHCR operations in Ghana - January 2010; AR2009/111/01, Audit of UNHCR operations in Senegal - April 2010; AR2009/121/02, Audit of asset management at the UNHCR operations in Georgia - March 2010). E. Financial management Need for UNHCR to review and align its organizational structures and capacity at the Headquarters to ensure that it is able to cope with and handle its various roles and responsibilities under the Common Humanitarian Funds (CHFs) implemented in different countries 29. UNHCR had not evaluated whether it had the structures and capacity at Headquarters to adequately support and coordinate UNHCR's various roles and responsibilities under the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) in the countries where it had been established, namely in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. Until now, UNHCR has focused only on the fundraising and resource mobilization aspects of its participation in the CHF. OIOS/IAD was of the opinion that a holistic approach was required to ensure UNHCR's effective participation in the CHFs as a whole, as UNHCR's participation goes beyond fundraising and touches upon the functional responsibilities of many of UNHCR's specialist divisions, as well as the Regional Bureau for Africa. UNHCR's roles and responsibilities under the CHF include protection cluster lead functions and inter-agency coordination functions, as well as programmatic and financial planning and monitoring and reporting on the use of CHF funds received. The mixture of activities involved and the related skills set required are therefore extensive. UNHCR accepted the recommendation made by OIOS/IAD in this regard and stated that the Donor Relations and Resource Mobilization Service (DRRM) of the Division of External Relations (DER) was actively involved in all policy level activities covering CHFs and providing regular guidance to the field colleagues, as CHFs are field-based funding mechanisms and Headquarters continued to provide assistance as and when needed. OIOS/IAD acknowledged the response provided by UNHCR but reiterated that focusing only on the fundraising and resource mobilization aspects would not give UNHCR a portfolio view of the risks and related control mechanisms pertaining to the CHFs (AR2009/115/04, Audit of UNHCR's arrangements for managing its participation in the Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund - May 2010). F. Human resources management 1. Need for better assistance and supervision of representatives in the field in exercising their delegated authority for recruiting national staff 30. There was a need to devise and implement suitable reporting, monitoring and support mechanisms in order to ascertain whether the authority delegated to the field offices for the recruitment of national staff is exercised properly and to take the necessary corrective action. The UNHCR Division of Human Resources Management (DHRM) agreed that training modules, as well as oversight and quality control mechanisms, would be put in place. These actions are planned to be implemented during 2010 (AR2009/162/02, Horizontal audit of UNHCR recruitment process for national staff - November 2009). 2. UNHCR increased the provision of training for the Medical Insurance Plan and implemented new MIP software to replace the old one that had become obsolete 31. OIOS/IAD was concerned that field offices did not have the adequate competencies and skills to discharge their responsibilities for the administration of the Medical Insurance Plan (MIP) that had been delegated to them, and that UNHCR Headquarters did not have the tools and mechanisms to exercise supervision over this delegated authority. The blanket nature of the authority delegated to the field, without a detailed analysis or consideration of the appropriate level of authority, increased the risk of non-compliance with the applicable MIP rules, instructions and guidance, including the potential for fraud. UNHCR agreed and introduced in early 2010, as an addition to MSRP, a range of built-in controls in line with the MIP rules, which mitigated the risks identified in the audit (AR2008/115/04, Audit of the Medical Insurance Plan at UNHCR - October 2009). G. Information technology management 1. Need to enhance certain functions in the MSRP Treasury Management Module 32. The Treasury Management Module of MSRP, implemented in November 2007, enabled the speedy treasury-side bank reconciliation, the automatic creation and posting of accounting entries for fund transfers and foreign exchange deals, and the reduction of the cash-in-transit account for replenishment of UNHCR country offices. Nevertheless, due to functionality gaps, certain processes pertaining to investment reporting and updating bank signatories were still performed using legacy applications. Considerable delays also existed in reconciling the general ledger with bank statements for certain bank accounts. OIOS/IAD also noted that several manual processes in the electronic fund transfer made the data files susceptible to unauthorized alteration of the information contained therein. In addition, the tool used by UNHCR managers to estimate the liquid funds needed in the near future was not reliable and had errors. The monitoring of the banks' compliance with operating instructions issued was also inadequate. UNHCR planned to implement these recommendations by 31 December 2010 (AR2009/161/01, Audit of UNHCR's Treasury Management (PeopleSoft) Module - April 2010). 2. Lack of standards on minimum requirement for information technology (IT) support 33. UNHCR did not have standard operating procedures setting forth the minimum requirements for IT support staff during the downsizing phase of an operation. Such procedures would be useful when operations in a particular region are downsized. In response to this recommendation, UNHCR prepared a guide on information and communications technology (ICT) staffing for field offices (AR2009/111/01, Audit of UNHCR operations in Senegal - April 2010). H. Safety and security 1. Design and standing of security management in UNHCR's organizational structure did not adequately reflect the importance and the high-risk nature of safety and security 34. OIOS/IAD was concerned that while an adequate governance mechanism for security management was well understood, the design and standing of security management in UNHCR's organizational structure did not adequately reflect the importance and the high-risk nature of safety and security to its staff and the refugees under its mandate. The location of UNHCR's Field Safety Section within the newly established Division of Emergency and Supply Management (subsequently renamed as the Division of Emergency, Security and Supply), and the location of the General Services Section, responsible for safety and security of staff and premises at UNHCR Headquarters, within the Division of Financial and Administrative Management, did not provide for a single, coordinated line of command for security management. UNHCR explained that the current organizational structure for security management was the result of a detailed review that was part of UNHCR's overall reform process and that the High Commissioner had personally assured that security has the highest possible visibility at UNHCR. Based on this explanation, OIOS/IAD closed the recommendation (AR2009/160/02, Audit of governance aspects of security management in UNHCR - December 2009). 2. UNHCR's cooperation on security issues with the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) was not efficient and there was a gap in the understanding of the respective mandates 35. The mandate of UNDSS does not include any provision for the safety and security of UNHCR's beneficiaries, whom UNHCR has a mandate to protect. This has resulted in different interpretations of the field presence requirements and operational needs. Whom UNHCR's mandate requires it to have an extended field presence, sometimes in remote areas, the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) has not always been willing to grant security clearance and provide security coverage for such areas. OIOS/IAD recommended that UNHCR develop a dialogue with UNDSS to formally clarify its mandate for the protection of refugees and other persons of concern, and its expectations from UNDSS in this regard. At the time of this report, OIOS/IAD was not aware of any action UNHCR had taken on the recommendation. There is therefore a concern that the absence of a mutually acceptable framework between UNDSS and UNHCR could jeopardize the security of the beneficiaries in the event of an emergency (AR2009/160/02, Audit of governance aspects of security management in UNHCR - December 2009). IV. Implementation rate of OIOS/IAD recommendations 36. Figure 3 provides a summary of recommendations issued and implemented during the reporting period by each focus area. Fifty-five per cent of recommendations made during the reporting period were implemented within the period. 37. OIOS/IAD would like to draw attention to the following actions undertaken by UNHCR, which allowed OIOS/IAD to close recommendations that had been outstanding for more than two years: Creation of a policy on urban refugees to provide clearer guidance and criteria for assistance to UNHCR beneficiaries living in urban areas. Creation and dissemination of a catalogue of queries and expenditure reports in the MSRP to assist managers and staff to effectively manage UNHCR resources and monitor their use. This includes a large range of queries related to financial management activities such as budget, treasury, account payable and receivable, General Ledger and payments to IPs. Issuance of guidance to increase staff awareness on the importance of security in information and communications technology (ICT) applications. 38. At the time of the report, 58 recommendations issued prior to 1 July 2008 had not yet been implemented. OIOS/IAD will be working with UNHCR over the next year to assess which recommendations are still relevant and discuss steps that can be taken to accelerate their implementation. Annex II provides details of the critical recommendations open for over two years. V. Other activities Risk assessment 39. In accordance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, OIOS/IAD updates its risk assessment of UNHCR on an ongoing basis as a result of audits conducted and changes in UNHCR's internal and external environment. OIOS/IAD plans to discuss with UNHCR management how the risk assessment might be used to assist UNHCR in developing a formal and systematic way of managing its risks. OIOS/IAD is also in the process of developing a new reporting template, which will incorporate risk language into OIOS/IAD reporting to UNHCR management. This will address a concern of UNHCR's management in the past that OIOS/IAD reports should make greater use of risk language. Cooperation and dialogue with other United Nations oversight bodies 40. OIOS/IAD cooperates with a number of oversight bodies within and outside the United Nations system, e.g. OIOS/IAD meets regularly with the Board of Auditors (BoA) and the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) to share information and to minimize overlap in oversight activities. As a matter of routine, work plans are shared with BOA and JIU and they are notified of audits at the planning stage and provided with copies of final reports. Quality assurance 42. In December 2008, OIOS/IAD launched its Quality Assurance and Improvement Programme to further improve the quality of its audits. A P-4 post, funded by OIOS/IAD, has been created in Geneva to assist in ensuring the quality of, among others, UNHCR Audit Section outputs. In the first half of 2010, OIOS/IAD conducted an internal quality assessment review to ensure that it conforms to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Auditing strategic management and governance 43. In June 2009, OIOS/IAD organized a workshop on auditing strategic management and governance, attended by some UNHCR Audit Section staff. The result was a toolkit, which has also been shared with UNHCR management. Governance issues have far-reaching impact on organizational effectiveness. It is OIOS/IAD's belief that through enhanced oversight of the governance processes and practices at every level of the organization, OIOS/IAD can promote management's awareness of the need for good governance and thereby add significant value to the organization's control environment and achievement of its objectives. Assistance of specialized OIOS/IAD units 44. To supplement and add value to the audit resources funded by UNHCR, the OIOS/IAD ICT Audit Section conducted ICT audits in UNHCR. Three such audit reports were issued during the reporting period. 45. OIOS/IAD also has a Special Assignments Section, to assist with forensic auditing.
