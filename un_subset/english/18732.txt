UNITED NATIONS E Economic and Social Council Distr. Original: COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS Fifty-eighth session Agenda item 10 ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS Letter dated 5 March 2002 from the Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights I have the honour to enclose herewith the report of the International Commission of Jurists round table on the draft optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), held in Geneva on 30 November 2001. The purpose of this conference was to provide a forum for the exchange of views between State representatives, organizations and experts in the field of economic, social and cultural rights on a wide range of issues pertaining to the ICESCR and to a possible draft optional protocol. I am of the opinion that the report of this conference contains a number of very valuable ideas and is likely to make an important contribution to the ongoing debate on this matter. I would therefore be most grateful if you could have this report* distributed as a document of the fifty-eighth session of the Commission on Human Rights, under item 10 of the agenda.
