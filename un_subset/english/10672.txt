The most severe packing group possible for the shipping name chosen shall be used. Where this provision is used the proper shipping name shall be supplemented with the word "sample" (e.g., FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S. Sample). In certain instances, where a specific proper shipping name is provided for a sample of a substance considered to meet certain classification criteria (e.g., GAS SAMPLE, NON-PRESSURIZED, FLAMMABLE, UN 3167) that shipping name shall be used. When an N.O.S. entry is used to transport the sample, the proper shipping name need not be supplemented with the technical name as required by special provision 274. 2.0.4.2 Samples of the substance shall be transported in accordance with the requirements applicable to the tentative assigned proper shipping name provided: (a) the substance is not considered to be a substance prohibited for transport by 1.1.2; (b) the substance is not considered to meet the criteria for Class 1 or considered to be an infectious substance or a radioactive material; (c) the substance is in compliance with 2.4.2.3.2.5(b) or 2.5.3.2.5.1 if it is a self-reactive substance or an organic peroxide, respectively; (d) the sample is transported in a combination packaging with a net mass per package not exceeding 2.5 kg; and (e) the sample is not packed together with other goods."

A large packaging design type is defined by the design, size, material and thickness, manner of construction and packing, but may include various surface treatments. It also includes large packagings which differ from the design type only in their lesser design height. 6.6.5.1.3 Tests shall be repeated on production samples at intervals established by the competent authority. For such tests on fibreboard large packagings, preparation at ambient conditions is considered equivalent to the provisions of 6.6.5.2.3. 6.6.5.1.4 Tests shall also be repeated after each modification which alters the design, material or manner of construction of large packagings. 6.6.5.1.5 The competent authority may permit the selective testing of large packagings that differ only in minor respects from a tested type, e.g. smaller sizes of inner packagings or inner packagings of lower net mass; and large packagings which are produced with small reductions in external dimension(s). 6.6.5.1.6 Where a large packaging has been successfully tested with different types of inner packagings, a variety of such different inner packagings may also be assembled in this large packaging. In addition, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained, the following variations in inner packagings are allowed without further testing of the package: (a) Inner packagings of equivalent or smaller size may be used provided: (i) the inner packagings are of similar design to the tested inner packagings (e.g. shape - round, rectangular, etc); (ii) the material of construction of the inner packagings (glass, plastics, metal etc.) offers resistance to impact and stacking forces equal to or greater than that of the originally tested inner packaging; (iii) the inner packagings have the same or smaller openings and the closure is of similar design (e.g. screw cap, friction lid, etc); (iv) sufficient additional cushioning material is used to take up void spaces and to prevent significant movement of the inner packagings; and (v) inner packagings are oriented within the large packagings in the same manner as in the tested package; (b) A lesser number of the tested inner packagings, or of the alternative types of inner packagings identified in (a) above, may be used provided sufficient cushioning is added to fill the void space(s) and to prevent significant movement of the inner packagings. 6.6.5.1.7 The competent authority may at any time require proof, by tests in accordance with this section, that serially-produced large packagings meet the requirements of the design type tests. 6.6.5.1.8 Provided the validity of the test results is not affected and with the approval of the competent authority, several tests may be made on one sample. 6.6.5.2 Preparation for testing 6.6.5.2.1 Tests shall be carried out on large packagings prepared as for transport including the inner packagings or articles used. Inner packagings shall be filled to not less than 98% of their maximum capacity for liquids or 95% for solids. For large packagings where the inner packagings are designed to carry liquids and solids, separate testing is required for both liquid and solid contents. The substances in the inner packagings or the articles to be transported in the large packagings may be replaced by other material or articles except where this would invalidate the results of the tests. When other inner packagings or articles are used they shall have the same physical characteristics (mass, etc) as the inner packagings or articles to be carried. It is permissible to use additives, such as bags of lead shot, to achieve the requisite total package mass, so long as they are placed so that the test results are not affected. 6.6.5.2.2 Large packagings made of plastics materials and large packagings containing inner packagings of plastic materials - other than bags intended to contain solids or articles - shall be drop tested when the temperature of the test sample and its contents has been reduced to -18°C or lower. This conditioning may be disregarded if the materials in question are of sufficient ductility and tensile strength at low temperatures. Where test sample are prepared in this way, the conditioning in 6.6.5.2.3 may be waived. Test liquids shall be kept in the liquid state by the addition of anti-freeze if necessary. 6.6.5.2.3 Large packagings of fibreboard shall be conditioned for at least 24 hours in an atmosphere having a controlled temperature and relative humidity (r.h). There are three options, one of which shall be chosen. The preferred atmosphere is 23 ± 2°C and 50% ± 2% r.h. The two other options are: 20 ± 2°C and 65% ± 2% r.h.; or 27 ± 2°C and 65% ± 2% r.h. Note: Average values shall fall within these limits. Short term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ± 5% relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility. 6.6.5.3 Test requirements 6.6.5.3.1 Bottom lift test 6.6.5.3.1.1 Applicability For all types of large packagings which are fitted with means of lifting from the base, as a design type test. 6.6.5.3.1.2 Preparation of large packagings for test The large packagings shall be loaded to 1.25 times its maximum permissible gross mass, the load being evenly distributed. 6.6.5.3.1.3 Method of testing The large packagings shall be raised and lowered twice by a lift truck with the forks centrally positioned and spaced at three quarters of the dimension of the side of entry (unless the points of entry are fixed).
