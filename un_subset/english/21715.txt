The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General dated 19 April 2002 (A/56/826) and amounted to US$ 41,529,500 gross ($38,488,500 net), exclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in kind of $3,670,800. It provided for 203 military observers, 27 military personnel, 26 civilian police, 184 international staff, 113 local staff and 10 observers from the African Union. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in paragraph 18 of its report dated 17 May 2002 (A/56/946), recommended that the General Assembly appropriate $41,529,500 gross for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. 2. The General Assembly, by its resolution 56/298 of 27 June 2002, appropriated an amount of $41,529,500 gross ($38,488,500 net) for the maintenance of the mission for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance 3. The mandate of MINURSO was established by the Security Council in its resolution 690 (1991). The mandate for the performance period was provided by Security Council resolutions 1406 (2002), 1429 (2002), 1463 (2003), 1469 (2003) and 1485 (2003). 4. The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to maintain international peace and security. 5. Within this overall objective, the Mission, during the performance report period, has contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, as shown in the frameworks below. These frameworks are grouped by components: substantive civilian, military and support. The components reflect, rather than determine, the common programmatic nature of the expected accomplishments and outputs contained therein. 6. The frameworks represent a shift towards a results-based budgeting approach. The 2002/03 budget did not include standard frameworks for planned results, which would have been the baseline against which performance would be measured and reported. Therefore, MINURSO mandate performance is presented in a transitional format showing the actual indicators of achievement and actual outputs during the 2002/03 period for which information was available. The expected accomplishments would lead to the fulfilment of the Security Council's objective within the time frame of the mission and the actual indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishments during the performance period. The actual outputs represent the contributions made by the mission towards the expected accomplishments during the performance period. Expected accomplishments Actual indicators of achievement 1.1 Progress towards the political settlement of the status of Western Sahara 1.1.1 Parties received, discussed and responded to the peace plan for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara 1.1.2 Neighbouring countries received, discussed and commented on the peace plan for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara 1.1.3 No hostilities between the parties Actual outputs 16 high-level political consultations by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General with the parties, neighbouring countries and key Member States 50 contacts by the Political Affairs Officer with the parties, neighboring countries and key Member States in the region 2 reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council Electronically archived 244,643 files relating to persons who applied to be included in the voter list Secured storage of 244,643 registered voter files and other sensitive Identification Commission documents and materials 250 summaries of international and regional media reports regarding issues of relevance to Western Sahara, for use in the preparation of assessments by political officers in the mission, the Secretariat and by Member States 1.2 Progress towards the resolution of humanitarian issues, in particular those related to prisoners of war (POWs), refugees and persons unaccounted for 1.2.1 The basic food needs of Western Saharan refugees are met 1.2.2 Increased interest in telephone services between the refugee camps and the Territory Conducted jointly with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 6 high-level meetings of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General with the parties and neighbouring States on the implementation of confidence-building measures Conducted 2 meetings, jointly with the World Food Programme, with more than 15 donors regarding the continuing food shortages in the Tindouf area refugee camps Contributed to the release of 100 POWs and organized a visit by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to the POW detention centre in Tindouf Conducted 2 high-level consultations with the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva on the situation regarding POWs and persons unaccounted for Assisted with the negotiation and implementation of proposals by UNHCR for limited confidence-building, telephone and mail services between the Tindouf refugee camps and the Territory Comments The telephone service was implemented but suspended shortly after it was started by one of the parties.

Non-budgeted contributions Actual value Status-of-forces agreement Voluntary contributions in-kind (non-budgeted) 7. The unspent balance resulted primarily from lower requirements for mission subsistence allowance due to an average vacancy rate of 6.4 per cent. The budget had been based on full deployment. 8. The unutilized balance was primarily attributable to rations. As a result of the adjusted distribution of resources between military and police and operational costs categories of expenditure, the costs of rations for military observers have been recorded under this heading, as well as under other supplies and equipment. The related apportionment was not adjusted, resulting in an unspent balance under this heading. 9. The unspent balance was the result of three factors: an average vacancy rate of 8.7 per cent, posts encumbered at lower than budgeted levels and the inclusion of service allowance in the calculation of international staff salaries. The latter item was recorded as expenditure under common staff costs. 10. The unspent balance resulted primarily from the encumbrance of national staff posts at levels lower than the GSL-4, step I level provided for in the budget. 11. The unutilized balance was primarily attributable to lower requirements for mission subsistence allowance paid to observers from the African Union. This was due to two factors: an average vacancy rate of 60 per cent and the fact that only 50 per cent of the observers received mission subsistence allowance from MINURSO. The remaining observers were paid directly by the African Union. 12. Provision was made for an independent jurist to assist the Identification Commission with its activities. However, with the suspension of the Commission, the services of an independent jurist were no longer required. Instead, the resources were used to retain consultancy services to assist with negotiations on the new political initiatives of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General. The variance resulted from differences in the length of time that consultancy services were retained and the rates at which they were paid. 13. Additional requirements for official travel arose primarily as a result of the need to support the new political initiatives of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary- General. 14. Additional requirements were attributable primarily to the replacement of the existing prefabricated accommodation facilities and equipment of the military observers. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the long-term duration of the mission, the prefabricated accommodation facilities had not been replaced since the inception of the mission in 1991. Continuous maintenance was no longer feasible and replacement became necessary to ensure that the military observers, many of them stationed in remote team sites subject to severe weather conditions, were provided with adequate accommodation. 15. Some vehicles for which budgetary provision had been made were unable to be procured due to the lack of a systems contract. However, to meet the operational requirements of the Mission, vehicles were transferred from the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH). The unspent balance was therefore the result of the difference between the budgeted purchase costs of the new vehicles and the costs relating to the transfer of existing vehicles from UNMIBH. 16. The unspent balance related primarily to reduced requirements for fuel, which resulted from the fact that actual aircraft utilization rates were substantially lower than budgeted for. 17. Additional requirements were principally attributable to the replacement of obsolete mobile communications equipment for military observers and the installation on patrol vehicles of mobile radios with global positioning system capabilities. 18. Additional requirements arose as a result of the acquisition of equipment required in connection with the establishment of a training centre, the replacement of the existing data backup system and the acquisition of a videoconferencing system to provide continuous communication with the liaison office in Tindouf. 19. Specialist medical services had previously been provided at no cost to MINURSO, as a result of which no budgetary provisions were made. This arrangement ceased during the performance period with the closure of the hospital at which the services had been provided. Additional requirements thus arose from the fact that specialist medical services for MINURSO personnel had to be sought elsewhere and had to be obtained at commercial rates. 20. The additional requirements were primarily attributable to rations. As a result of the adjusted distribution of resources between military and police and operational costs categories of expenditure, the costs of rations have been recorded under this heading, as well as under military contingents. The related apportionment was not adjusted, resulting in an overrun under this heading. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 21. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of MINURSO are: (a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $3,120,500 with respect to the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003; (b) To decide on the treatment of other income and adjustments for the period ended 30 June 2003, amounting to $2,833,000 from interest income ($177,000) and other/miscellaneous income ($170,000), offset by prior-period adjustments of $36,000 and savings on or cancellation of prior-period obligations ($2,522,000).
