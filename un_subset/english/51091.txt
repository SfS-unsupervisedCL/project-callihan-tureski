Commission on the Status of Women Fifty-fourth session 1-12 March 2010 Item 5 of the provisional agenda* Follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolutions and decisions Letter dated 19 November 2009 from the President of the Economic and Social Council to the Chairperson of the Commission on the Status of Women * E/CN.6/2010/1. The 2009 substantive session of the Economic and Social Council in July broke new ground on the issue of health. By promoting consensus on issues ranging from non-communicable diseases, communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, health systems, health literacy, e-health, financing and more, the Council opened the way for new opportunities to promote global public health. I see this as a major step forward to an effective implementation of the new approach to health issues, which is based on mobilizing various constituencies for action. The Council has set the stage for many follow-up actions leading to development of regional action plans on health literacy or multisectoral working groups on health challenges. This will certainly also help us to realize the potential of the Council in generating momentum towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by bringing together many diverse constituencies on issues of global importance and in encouraging innovative solutions to problems. The adoption of the Council's ministerial declaration will provide much needed political impetus to the implementation of the global public health goals. With regard to the outcomes of the Council's substantive session in July 2009, I would like to highlight, in particular, some proposals made by the Council which are of relevance to the functional commissions. A list of the resolutions adopted by the Council specifically calling for action by the functional commissions is attached for reference (see annex). I wish to draw particular attention to Economic and Social Council resolution 2009/29 on the role of the Council in the integrated and coordinated implementation of the outcome of and follow-up to major United Nations conferences and summits. In that resolution, the Council, inter alia, reiterated its role as the central mechanism for system-wide coordination as well as its role in promoting the integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences in the economic, social and related fields, repeated its invitation to the organizations of the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization, to contribute, within their respective mandates, to the work of the Council, as appropriate, including to the integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits, and recognized the need for more effective consideration of the issue of integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits, and in that regard, decided to review the programme of work for its substantive session so as to avoid duplication and overlap between its coordination and general segments. I would greatly appreciate it if the above information could be brought to the attention of the Commission on the Status of Women for consideration and action, and wish to thank you for your continued assistance and collaboration in this regard.
