Letter dated 27 February 2002 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Finland to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1386 (2001), in which the Council called upon Member States to contribute personnel, equipment and other resources to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, I am pleased to inform you that the Government of the Republic of Finland decided on 21 January 2002 to participate in the Force with a maximum of 50 civil-military cooperation and liaison officers. The Government's decision authorizes the Finnish contingent to participate in the Force for the first three months, the period during which the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is serving as the lead nation of the Force. Thereafter, the Finnish participation will be reconsidered. The Finnish contingent (46) arrived in Kabul on 11 and 12 February 2002 and has been fully operative since 16 February 2002. I would appreciate it if the present letter could be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Anne Meskanen First Secretary Chargé d'affaires a.i.
