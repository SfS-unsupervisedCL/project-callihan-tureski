Draft resolution The Security Council, Recalling all its previous relevant resolutions, in particular resolutions 1595 (2005), 1636 (2005), 1644 (2005), 1664 (2006), 1686 (2006), 1373 (2001) and 1566 (2004), Reaffirming its strongest condemnation of the 14 February 2005 terrorist bombing, as well as of all other attacks in Lebanon since October 2004, and reaffirming also that those involved in these attacks must be held accountable for their crimes, Having examined the report of the International Independent Investigation Commission (S/2007/150) ("The Commission"), submitted pursuant to resolutions 1595 (2005), 1636 (2005), 1644 (2005), and 1686 (2006), Commending the Commission for the outstanding professional work it continues to accomplish under difficult circumstances in assisting the Lebanese authorities in their investigation into all aspects of this terrorist act, Taking note of the letter of the Prime Minister of Lebanon of 21 February 2007 to the Secretary-General (S/2007/159, Enclosure) requesting that the mandate of the Commission be extended for a further period of up to one year from 15 June 2007 in order to ensure stability and continuity in the investigative process, and noting the concurrent recommendation of the Secretary-General in this regard, Noting the Commission's conclusion that, in light of its current and planned investigative activities and while significant progress has been made, it is unlikely that the Commission will complete its work before its current mandate expires and that the Commission therefore welcomes the Lebanese request for an extension of its mandate beyond this date, Willing to continue to assist Lebanon in the search for the truth and in holding all those involved in this terrorist attack accountable, 1. Welcomes the report of the Commission; 2. Decides to extend the mandate of the Commission until 15 June 2008 and declares its readiness to terminate the mandate earlier if the Commission reports that it has completed the implementation of its mandate; 3. Requests the Commission to continue to report to the Council on the progress of the investigation every four months, or at any other time as it deems appropriate; 4. Decides to remain seized of the matter.
