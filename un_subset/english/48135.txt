Trade and Development Board Special session 17 - 20 March 2008 Rule 77 of the rules of procedure of the Trade and Development Board provides for the participation of nongovernmental organizations in the activities of UNCTAD. In accordance with Board decision 43 (VII), a distinction is made between international nongovernmental organizations which exercise functions, and have a basic interest, in most of the activities of the Board and of its subsidiary bodies, and those which have a special competence in, and are concerned with, specific matters falling within the terms of reference of one or two subsidiary bodies or of the Board itself. The former are placed in the General Category and the latter in the Special Category. National non-governmental organizations of recognized standing which are deemed to have a significant contribution to make to the work of UNCTAD may be entered by the Secretary-General of UNCTAD in a register established for this purpose. As at the end of October 2007, there are 200 non-governmental organizations included in the list provided for in rule 77 of the Board's rules of procedure: 110 in the General Category and 90 in the Special Category. In addition, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD has entered 21 national non-governmental organizations in the Register. The list of organizations follows. I.
