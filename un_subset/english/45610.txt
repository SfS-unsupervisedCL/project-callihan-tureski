UNITED NATIONS A General Assembly Distr. Original: HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL Seventh session Agenda item 7 HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN PALESTINE AND OTHER OCCUPIED ARAB TERRITORIES Human Rights Council resolution 6/19 on religious and cultural rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem Note of the High Commissioner for Human Rights* 1. The present note is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 6/19 of 28 September 2007 on religious and cultural rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, in which the Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council, at its seventh session, on the implementation of that resolution. 2. The issue of access of Palestinians to their holy sites is dealt with, albeit to a limited extent, in the report that the High Commissioner recently submitted to the Council pursuant to its resolution S-6/1. The High Commissioner intends, however, to report in greater detail on any policies or measures taken by Israel which limit access of Palestinian residents in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (both Christians and Muslims) to their religious sites located in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.
