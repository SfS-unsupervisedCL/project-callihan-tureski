General Assembly Fifty-ninth session Agenda item 36 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Fifty-ninth year Letter dated 29 September 2004 from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit herewith a summary of Israeli violations and acts of aggression against Lebanon from 2 to 23 September 2004 (see annex). These grave violations are part of a series of persistent and provocative Israeli violations of Lebanese territory, including air, sea and land, and intervene against the principles of international law, the resolutions of international legitimacy and your repeated calls for their cessation. In view of these violations and the stepping-up of Israeli threats against Lebanon and the safety of its territory and its citizens, Lebanon calls upon the United Nations to deter and prevent Israel from such dangerous acts, which constitute a threat to international security and peace. Lebanon holds Israel fully responsible for any consequences to which those acts may lead. In drawing your attention to the gravity consequences of such acts, I request to have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 36, and of the Security Council.
