of 19 December 2007, 63/222 of 19 December 2008, 64/210 of 21 December 2009, 65/168 of 20 December 2010 and 66/210 of 22 December 2011 on the role of the United Nations in promoting development in the

of today, recognizing the universality of the United Nations, and reaffirming its commitment to promote and strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system, "Reaffirming the role and authority of the General Assembly on global matters of concern to the international community, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations, especially in promoting international cooperation for development and policy coherence on global development issues, including in the context of globalization and interdependence, "Acknowledging that the United Nations, particularly the General Assembly, provides a universal and inclusive multilateral forum which confers incomparable value to its discussions and its decisions on global matters of concern to the international community, "Recalling the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and its outcome document, entitled `The future we want', and all major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social, environmental and related fields for the promotion of sustainable development and their outcomes and follow-up processes, in particular the International Conference on Financing for Development, the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus and the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development, "Recognizing that the international multilateral system should urgently support sustainable development, particularly in relation to inclusive and equitable economic growth, job creation and the efforts of developing countries to eradicate poverty and hunger and achieve environmental sustainability, "Emphasizing that globalization is a useful tool for development that should benefit all countries and that every effort should be made to meaningfully integrate developing countries into the global economy by creating an enabling international environment for their goods and services, "Recognizing that globalization and interdependence imply that the economic performance of a country is increasingly affected by factors outside its geographical borders, that maximizing in an equitable manner the benefits of globalization requires responses at the global and regional levels and that there remains a need for a strengthened global partnership for development to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, "Reaffirming its strong support for fair and inclusive globalization and the need to translate economic growth into sustainable development, particularly poverty eradication and, in this regard, its resolve to make the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people, a central objective of relevant national and international policies as well as national development strategies, including poverty eradication strategies, as part of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, "Reaffirming also the commitment to eradicate poverty and hunger and promote sustained economic growth, sustainable development and global prosperity for all and to promote the development of the productive sectors in developing countries to enable them to participate more effectively in and benefit from the process of globalization, "Expressing deep concern about the ongoing adverse impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, particularly on development, cognizant that the global economy, notwithstanding significant efforts, still remains in a challenging phase with elevated downside risks, including turbulence in global financial and commodity markets, high unemployment and indebtedness in several developed and developing countries and widespread fiscal strains, which threaten the global economic recovery and reflect limited progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand, and stressing the need to continue to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and the urgent need for continuing efforts to reform and strengthen the international financial system, while implementing the reforms agreed to date, "Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General, "1. Reiterates the need for inclusive, transparent and effective multilateral approaches to managing global economic challenges, and in this regard reaffirms the central role of the United Nations system in ongoing efforts to find common solutions to such challenges; "2. Recognizes the need for the multilateral trade, economic and financial architecture to incorporate and promote sustainable development and ensure greater coherence and coordination to promote an enabling international environment that facilitates the work of Member States in addressing poverty, inequalities and environment; "3. Reaffirms the need for the United Nations to play a fundamental role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence, coordination and implementation of development goals and actions agreed upon by the international community, and reiterates its commitment to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial, trade and development institutions in order to support sustainable development, particularly in the context of a post-2015 development agenda; "4. Also reaffirms the need to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in enhancing the global partnership for development, with a view to creating a supportive global environment for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, including accelerating efforts to deliver and fully implement existing global partnership for development commitments; "5. Emphasizes, in this regard, the need for enhanced accountability of the United Nations development system, in particular the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, to Member States in order to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in enhancing the global partnership for development; "6. Recognizes that the scaling-up of successful policies and approaches in the implementation and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals needs to be complemented by a strengthened global partnership for development, and in this regard calls upon Member States to reinvigorate their support and aid to the full and timely achievement of the Goals; "7. Also recognizes the central role of a strengthened global partnership for development, based on lessons learned in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, to support a truly universal global development agenda beyond 2015, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities; "8. Further recognizes that the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rules-based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy, that is, the scope for domestic policy, especially in the areas of trade, investment and international development, is now often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations and that it is for each Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space; "9. Recognizes that policies which integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development can contribute to reducing inequalities within and among countries with a view to guaranteeing that the poor and those living in the most vulnerable situations maximize their benefits from a globalized world; "10. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventieth session the item entitled `Globalization and interdependence', and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly a report on the sub-item entitled `Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence'." 3.
