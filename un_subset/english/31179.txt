The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 19 December 2003 (A/58/644) and amounted to $47,448,700 gross ($45,095,400 net), exclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in kind in the amount of $1,274,400. It provided for 1,230 military contingent personnel, 69 civilian police officers, 48 international staff and 110 national staff. Subsequently, in his report on strengthening the security and safety of United Nations operations, staff and premises of 5 April 2004 (A/58/756), the Secretary-General proposed, inter alia, a number of security enhancements in UNFICYP requiring the acquisition of equipment and improvements to the physical infrastructure at a total estimated cost of $2,176,900. 2. On the basis of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in paragraph 21 of its report on the financing of UNFICYP of 13 April 2004 (A/58/759/Add.4) and in paragraph 27 of its report on the strengthening of the security and safety of United Nations operations, staff and premises of 6 April 2004 (A/58/758), the General Assembly, by its resolution 58/301 of 18 June 2004, appropriated an amount of $49,417,300 gross ($47,093,500 net) for UNFICYP for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 comprising the amount of $47,240,400 gross ($44,916,600 net) for the maintenance of the Force and $2,176,900 gross and net for the strengthening of the security and safety of the staff and premises of the Force. The appropriated amount included voluntary contributions from the Government of Cyprus in the amount of $16,444,900, equivalent to one third of the net cost of UNFICYP, and $6.5 million from the Government of Greece. An amount of $26,472,400 gross ($24,148,600 net) was assessed on Member States for the maintenance of UNFICYP and the strengthening of the security and safety of the staff and premises of the Force for that period. II. Mandate performance 3. The mandate of UNFICYP was established by the Security Council in its resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964. The mandate for the performance period was provided by the Council in its resolutions 1548 (2004) of 11 June 2004 and 1568 (2004) of 22 October 2004. 4. By its resolution 1568 (2004), the Security Council endorsed the Secretary-General's recommendations for the amendment of the concept of operations and force level of UNFICYP from 1,230 to 860 military personnel, as outlined in his report of 24 September 2004 (S/2004/756). 5. UNFICYP is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to ensure peace and security in Cyprus and the return to normal conditions. 6. Within this overall objective, UNFICYP has, during the performance report period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below. These frameworks are grouped by components: substantive civilian, military, civilian police and support. 7. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based frameworks set out in the 2004/05 budget. In particular, the performance report compares the actual indicators of achievement, i.e. the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement and compares the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs. Component 1: substantive civilian Expected accomplishment 1.1: improved relations and understanding between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities building on the contacts from the opening of the crossings Planned indicators of achievement Actual indicators of achievement No incidents at crossing points 8 incidents related primarily to the non-presentation of identification documents and lack of vehicle insurance documents required on the other side of the buffer zone 30 per cent increase in the number of cases effectively resolved by UNFICYP from 80 in 2002/03 to 104 335 cases resolved (related to arrests, detentions, prison visits, asylum-seeking; humanitarian relief and medical evacuations; farming, mine awareness and unauthorized civilian use of the buffer zone) compared to 80 in 2002/03 (319 per cent increase) and 250 in 2003/04 owing to increased cooperation by the parties and opening of the crossing points in April 2003 100 per cent increase in bicommunal events from 95 in 2002/03 to 190 106 events compared to 95 in 2002/03 (12 per cent increase) and 260 in 2003/04.

IV. Analysis of variances 8. The unutilized balance under this heading is attributable to the phased repatriation of military personnel in January, February and April 2005 pursuant to Security Council resolution 1568 (2004) and the resulting lower average deployment of 1,066 personnel compared to the budgeted 1,230 military personnel. 9. The additional requirements under this heading are attributable to an increase in the daily mission subsistence allowance rate from the budgeted $12 to $25 on 1 July 2004 and $36 on 1 August 2004, combined with the appreciation of the Cyprus pound against the United States dollar when the mission subsistence allowance became payable in local currency (PoundC 17) from 1 February 2005 offset in part by a higher actual vacancy rate (33.3 per cent compared to the budgeted 10 per cent), with an average deployment of 46 civilian police personnel for the period. 10. The unspent balance under this heading reflects lower actual staff assessment expenditure incurred during the reporting period compared to the standard costs used for the estimation of staff assessment requirements in the budget combined with a higher average vacancy rate for international staff (15.2 per cent) because of the mission's decision to block 8 vacated international posts owing to the reduction from 1 July 2005 of the international staffing establishment of the Division of Administration by three Field Service posts and the conversion of five Field Service posts to national staff posts, offset in part by an increase during the reporting period of the post adjustment multiplier, ranging from 38 to 47.5, compared to 27.6 used in the budget and the introduction of a revised international staff salary scale effective 1 January 2005. 11. The variance under this heading is attributable to the 11 per cent appreciation of the Cyprus pound against the United States dollar (an average of PoundC 0.455 compared to the budgeted PoundC 0.510) and to a 5.7 per cent salary scale increase effective 1 September 2004. 12. The additional requirements under this heading are attributable to the temporary replacement of one Administrative Assistant pending the recruitment of an international staff member, as well as to the replacement of three national staff on extended sick leave and the short-term hiring of one temporary finance, one procurement and three communications personnel to avoid disruption of service following the transfer to other peacekeeping missions of international staff occupying posts subsequently converted from 1 July 2005 to national staff posts. 13. The unutilized balance under this heading is attributable to the reduced official travel requirements to destinations outside the mission area and the resulting lower number of trips actually undertaken during the reporting period, as well as lower expenditure in respect of training-related travel owing to the application of the train- the-trainers policy and the provision of training locally. 14. The additional requirements under this heading are attributable primarily to the unforeseen requirements in connection with the relocation of military contingent personnel to centralized locations following the reduction of the force level and closure of camps, patrol bases and observation posts, combined with the 11 per cent appreciation of the Cyprus pound against the United States dollar and the resulting higher cost of supplies and services provided locally, as well as to increases in the cost of diesel fuel and contractual maintenance services. Expenditure incurred under the above heading against a provision of $2,149,900 for strengthening the security and safety of the staff and premises of the Force amounted to $2,057,400 and included the acquisition and installation of a closed-circuit television system, shatter-proof materials, automatic gate systems and security barriers, prefabricated blast walls, concrete barriers, various items of security equipment (X-ray screening systems, metal and explosives detectors) and supplies, as well as security enhancement engineering projects. 15. The variance under this heading is attributable to the 196 per cent increase in the rental cost of nine cross-country 4x4 vehicles effective 1 July 2004, the increase in the cost of fuel combined with the appreciation of the Cyprus pound during the reporting period, as well as expenditure related to the acquisition of nine cross-country 4x4 vehicles, delivered in June 2005, as their continued commercial rental became financially non-viable owing to the increase in rental costs, offset in part by a lower number of rented vehicles (253 compared to the budgeted 265). 16. The additional requirements under this heading are attributable to the acquisition of fibre-optic transceivers and switches to support the network upgrade and data-processing equipment for data storage and disaster recovery, offset in part by reduced requirements for maintenance and repair services owing to the utilization of in-house repair capabilities in lieu of local contractors and the lower cost of licenses owing to the introduction of a new cost-effective software volume licensing agreement. 17. The additional requirements under this heading are attributable to the increased costs of medical services provided by private doctors and clinics and the increased costs of medicines and medical supplies combined with the appreciation of the Cyprus pound during the reporting period. 18. The variance under this heading is attributable to the lower actual cost of 21 binoculars (12 replacement and 9 additional) for the civilian police personnel owing to favourable prices obtained on the market. Other supplies, services and equipment 19. The unspent balance under this heading is primarily attributable to savings resulting from the utilization of existing military accoutrements stocks and supplies and reduced requirements for military haircutting services and welfare activities following the reduction of the military contingent strength, as well as lower actual expenditure on training fees and supplies owing to fewer training courses undertaken during the reporting period. Reduced requirements under this heading were partially offset by higher actual freight and customs clearance expenditure owing to the transfer of a forklift, a medium cargo truck and a bulldozer, communications equipment and one prefabricated kitchen unit from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and other missions, as well as the acquisition of miscellaneous security items (respirators, chemical suits and decontamination showers) for the strengthening of the security and safety of the staff and premises of the Force. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 20. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNFICYP are: (a) To decide that Member States shall waive their respective shares in other income for the period ended 30 June 2005 amounting to $541,100 and their respective shares in the amount of $191,300 from the unencumbered balance of $792,200 for the period ended 30 June 2005, to be applied to meeting the current and future after-service health insurance liabilities of the United Nations; (b) To decide on the treatment of the remaining unencumbered balance of $600,900 for the period ended 30 June 2005.
