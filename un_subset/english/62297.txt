Sixty-seventh session Agenda item 142 Financing of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994 First performance report on the budget of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for the biennium 2012-2013 Report of the Secretary-General Summary The first performance report on the budget of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for the biennium 2012-2013 is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/238. As reflected in section II of the present report, the total amount of $188,279,300 gross for revised estimates takes into account post-related actual expenditure experience in 2012 and updated projected rates. On this basis, the revised estimates reflect an increase of $15.7 million, net of staff assessment, over the initial appropriation for the biennium 2012-2013. It will be recalled that, in the context of the regular budget, the General Assembly, in its resolution 66/246, decided to defer consideration of post-related recosting for inflation and exchange rate projections to the first performance report on the budget for the biennium 2012-2013, in order to ensure appropriation of post-related costs in line with actual expenditure experience. Post-related recosting was similarly deferred pursuant to resolution 66/238, as detailed in the annex thereto. Accordingly, section III of the present report indicates a total amount of $182,163,600 gross for revised estimates, taking into account post-related actual expenditure experience in 2012 and the deferral of post-related recosting for updated projected rates. On that basis, the revised estimates reflect an increase of $10 million, net of staff assessment, over the initial appropriation for the biennium 2012-2013. The action to be taken by the General Assembly is provided in section IV of the present report. 1. The primary purpose of the first performance report is to identify revised estimates owing to variations in the rates of inflation and exchange, and in the standards and vacancies assumed in the calculation of the initial appropriations. The variations take into account post-related actual expenditure experience in 2012 and updated projected rates. 2. The net increase of $15,699,500 for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda results from the technical adjustments shown in tables 2 and 3 below. Table 2 reflects the changes by component and main determining factor, and table 3 reflects the changes by object of expenditure and main determining factors. 3. Explanations of the variations in the costing parameters assumed in the calculation of the initial appropriations are provided in section II. In addition, the annex provides the budgetary assumptions used in the initial appropriations for the biennium 2012-2013 and the rates used in the present report. 4. Section III of the report indicates net adjustments in the amount of $9,972,200, taking into account post-related actual expenditure experience in 2012 and deferral of post-related recosting for updated projected rates, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/238. 5. The revised estimates are summarized in table 1 below.

It will be recalled that, in its resolution 66/238, the General Assembly decided to defer consideration of post-related recosting for inflation and exchange rate projections to the first performance report on the budget for the biennium 2012-2013, in order to ensure appropriation of post-related costs in line with actual expenditure experience. Accordingly, post-related requirements for inflation and exchange rates in the initial appropriation for the biennium 2012-2013 are at the same level as those in the revised appropriation for the biennium 2010-2011. As set out in section II therefore, the adjustments for posts are based on the actual experience during the year and updated projections compared with those approved in the revised appropriation for the biennium 2010-2011. 8. For non-post-related requirements, the adjustments are based on actual experience during the year and updated projections compared with those foreseen in the initial appropriation for the biennium 2012-2013. A. Changes in exchange rates (Decrease: $3,923,900) 9. The basis for recosting can be either the average operational rates of exchange experienced thus far in the biennium (the averaging method) or the operational rates in effect at the time of recosting (the latest rate). It will be recalled that, in its report on the accounts of the United Nations for the biennium ended 31 December 1995 (A/51/5 (Vol. I), chap. II, para. 110), the Board of Auditors recommended that budgetary assumptions relating to operational exchange rates be based on an averaging method instead of the latest available exchange rates. The Secretary-General had indicated that it would not be advisable to predetermine whether the averaging method or the latest month should be used for budget forecasting and recosting, and that such a decision should be taken at the time of each recosting. This was reported to the General Assembly and agreed to by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (see A/51/7/Add.1-9 and A/51/7/Add.6, para. 5), which indicated that the Secretary-General should use such rates as would allow for the lowest estimates. 10. In the present performance report, the exchange rates realized have been applied to the period from January to October 2012, and the October 2012 exchange rate has been applied to November and December 2012. For 2013, the October 2012 rate (the latest rate) has been applied for the Rwanda franc, whereas the average operational rates of exchange experienced thus far in the biennium (the averaging method) have been applied for the euro and Tanzanian shilling, so as to allow for the lowest estimate in respect of requirements in accordance with established methodology. The decrease of $3,923,900 mainly reflects the net effect of the overall depreciation of the Tanzanian shilling, euro and the Rwanda franc in 2012, compared with the budgeted rates (see figures I-III below). Adjustments resulting from actual experience in 2013 would be implemented in the second performance report for the biennium 2012-2013.

Changes in inflation assumptions (Increase: $19,132,900) 11. The revised projected inflation rates applied to all objects of expenditure in Arusha (United Republic of Tanzania), Kigali and The Hague (Netherlands) are based on: (a) post adjustment multipliers that have been promulgated by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) for the Professional category and above for the period from January to October 2012 and projections based on ICSC data; (b) actual versus budgeted cost-of-living adjustments based on prevailing market conditions for the General Service and related categories; and (c) the latest available information on consumer price indices as derived from the Economist for non-post objects of expenditure. 12. The increase mainly relates to upward cost-of-living adjustments applicable to posts in the General Service and related categories and post adjustment multipliers applicable to posts in the Professional and higher category. C. Adjustments to standard costs (Decrease: $421,200) 13. The decrease of $421,200 results from the net effect of adjustments to standard salary costs, common staff costs and staff assessment rates. Revisions to standard salary costs for 2012 are based on the actual payroll averages experienced thus far in the biennium, by category and level at each duty station. For the present report, January to September 2012 monthly payroll averages from Arusha, Kigali and The Hague have been analysed at each category and level and compared with those used in the initial appropriation. Projections for 2013 are based on the trends experienced in 2012. 14. Common staff costs are budgeted as a percentage of net salaries for each duty station. Expenditures under common staff costs relate to allowances and benefits, appointments, transfers and separation of staff. Adjustments to common staff costs are based on the analysis of actual common staff costs experience for all three duty stations during the biennium 2010-2011 as well as the experience from January to September 2012 compared with those assumed in the initial appropriation. D. Vacancies (Increase: $1,868,400) 15. The increase of $1,868,400 results from the adjustments to the 2012-2013 vacancy rates, taking into account the experience realized, as reflected in the annex. III. Revised estimates based on post-related actual expenditure experience 16. Section II above identifies adjustments as a result of variations in costing parameters, taking into account post-related actual expenditure experience in 2012 and updated projected rates for the biennium 2012-2013. Consequently, the revised estimate based on post-related actual expenditure and updated projected rates is $188,279,300, as reflected in table 5 and will be included in the base for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015. 17. In line with General Assembly resolution 66/238, the revised estimates are based on the post-related actual expenditure experience in 2012, with deferral of post-related recosting for updated projected rates. Accordingly, the revised estimates amount to $182,163,600. The adjustments resulting from actual experience for the biennium will be reported in the second performance report for the biennium 2012-2013. 18. Accordingly, the amount of $69,208,100 under posts for 2012 reflects the actual expenditure experience from January to September, extrapolated to December. It should be noted that the amount excludes the ICSC projections for post adjustments to year end. For 2013, the amount of $46,854,500 under posts reflects the deferred post-related recosting and is therefore at the same level as the initial appropriation. Non-post resources are recosted in accordance with existing practice as detailed in section II above.

IV. Action requested of the General Assembly 19. The General Assembly is requested to take note of the revised level of resources for the biennium 2012-2013 and the base for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015, as contained in table 5. 20. The General Assembly is further requested to decide on the revised estimates, as reflected in table 4, in accordance with resolution 66/238.
