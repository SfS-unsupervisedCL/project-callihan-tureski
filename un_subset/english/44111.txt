(Signed) Ileana Núñez Mordoche Ambassador Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations Acting Chair of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement FINAL DOCUMENT TABLE OF CONTENTS The Ministers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, met on 29 and 30 July 2008 in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, under the Chairmanship of H.E. Mr. Manouchehr Mottaki, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran to review the progress and implementation of the Plan of Action adopted at the 14th Conference of Heads of States or Governments of the NonAligned Movement held 15-16 September 2006 in Havana, Cuba, prepare for the upcoming NAM Summit and address urgent matters. In this regard, they reaffirmed and underscored the Movement's abiding faith in and strong commitment to its Founding Principles, ideals and purposes, particularly in establishing a peaceful and prosperous world, a just and equitable world order as well as to the purposes and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The Ministers affirmed the continued relevance and validity of all principled positions and decisions of the Movement as contained in the substantive outcome documents of the 14th NAM Summit held in Havana, Cuba, 15-16 September 2006 and the preceding thirteen Summit Conferences of the Movement, as well as all preceding Ministerial Conferences or Meetings of the Movement. Likewise, they expressed their determination to preserve and act in keeping with the Bandung Principles and the purposes and principles of the Non-Aligned Movement in the present international juncture as agreed in the Declaration on the Purposes and Principles and the Role of the Non-Aligned Movement in the Present International Juncture adopted in the 14th NAM Summit in Havana. The Ministers acknowledged the NAM Chair's Report on the Movement's activities covering from the 14th NAM Summit held in Havana to date, which showed significant progress in the process of strengthening and revitalizing the Non-Aligned Movement. CHAPTER I: GLOBAL ISSUES Review of the International Situation The Ministers emphasized that the present global scenario presents great challenges in the areas of peace and security, economic development and social progress, human rights and the rule of law to Non-Aligned Countries. They affirmed that many new areas of concern and challenges have emerged which warrant the renewal of commitment by the international community to uphold and defend the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations (UN) and the principles of international law. In taking stock of developments at the international level since the 14th Conference of Ministers of the Movement, they noted that the collective desire of the Movement to establish a peaceful and prosperous world as well as a just and equitable world order remains encumbered by fundamental impediments. These impediments are in the form of, inter alia, the continuing lack of resources and underdevelopment of the majority of the developing world, on the one hand, and in the form of, inter alia, the continuing lack of cooperation of and coercive and unilateral measures imposed by some developed countries, on the other. The rich and powerful countries continue to exercise an inordinate influence in determining the nature and direction of international relations, including economic and trade relations, as well as the rules governing these relations, many of which are at the expense of developing countries. The Ministers reaffirmed that the Movement will remain guided in its endeavours by its Founding Principles, the principles enshrined in the Declaration on the Purposes and Principles and the Role of the Non-Aligned Movement in the Present International Juncture adopted in the 14th NAM Summit in Havana, the UN Charter and international law. To this end, the Movement will continue to uphold the principles of sovereignty and the sovereign equality of States, territorial integrity and non-intervention in the internal affairs of any State; take effective measures for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of peace, to defend, promote and encourage the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered; refrain in international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; develop friendly relations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and the self-determination of peoples in their struggle against foreign occupation; achieve international cooperation based on solidarity among peoples and governments in solving international problems of a political, economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character; and promote and encourage the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. The Ministers noted that the existing, new and emerging threats and challenges continue to impede efforts by States to attain greater economic development and social progress, peace and security, and enjoyment of human rights and the rule of law. Global peace and security continue to elude humankind as a result of, inter alia, increasing tendency by certain States to resort to unilateralism and unilaterally imposed measures, non-fulfilment of the commitments and obligations assumed under the relevant international legally binding instruments especially on weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons treaties, terrorism, conflicts, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, the use of double standards in international relations, the continuing failure and unwillingness of the majority of the developed countries to fulfil their commitments in the economic and social fields. They underscored the need for the international community to collectively redress these situations in accordance with the UN Charter and the principles of international law. Globalisation presents opportunities, challenges and risks to the future and viability of developing countries. The process of globalisation and trade liberalisation has produced uneven benefits among and within States and that the global economy has been characterised by slow and lopsided growth and instability. In its present form, globalisation perpetuates or even increases the marginalisation of developing countries. Therefore, globalisation must be transformed into a positive force for change for all peoples, benefiting all countries, and contributing to the prosperity and empowerment of developing countries, not their continued impoverishment and dependence on the developed world. In addition, greater efforts must be made to generate a global strategy to prioritise the development dimension into global processes in order to enable developing countries to benefit from the opportunities offered by globalisation and trade liberalisation, including through the creation of an enabling external economic environment for development which requires greater coherence between the international trading, monetary and financial systems that should be open, equitable, non-coercive, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory. The revolution in information and communication technologies continue to change the world at a rapid speed and in a fundamental way, and has created a vast and widening digital divide between the developed and developing countries, which must be bridged if the latter are to benefit from the globalisation process. These new technological innovations must be made more easily available to developing countries in their efforts to modernise and revitalise their economies in pursuit of their developmental goals and well being of their populations. In this context, the achievement of these goals requires an enabling international environment and the honouring of commitments and pledges made by States, in particular the developed world. The future will present as many challenges and opportunities as the past and the Movement must continue to remain strong, cohesive and resilient in order to address them and preserve the historic legacy of the Movement. The continued and relevance and validity of the Movement will depend, in large measure, on the unity and solidarity of each of its Member Countries as well as their ability to influence these changes positively. In this regard, the process of the revitalisation and strengthening of the Movement must continue to be advanced and consolidated. The Ministers recalled the decision of the Summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), held in Algiers in July 1999, calling for the restoration of constitutional legality in States whose governments had come to power through unconstitutional means, and in this context, encouraged the Non-Aligned Countries to continue to uphold the democratic ideals consistent with the Founding Principles of the Movement. Non-Aligned Movement: Role and Methods of Work Recognising the aspirations of their peoples, the Ministers reaffirmed the Movement's irrevocable political and moral commitment and determination to and full respect for the Bandung Principles and those adopted at the Havana Summit and the UN Charter as well as for their preservation and promotion, with a view to further consolidate and enhance the Movement's role and position as the principal political platform representing the developing world in multilateral forums, in particular the UN. In this context, they stressed that achieving the principles, ideals and purposes of the Movement hinges upon the unity, solidarity and cohesion among its membership, firmly rooted on mutual respect, respect for diversity and tolerance. The Ministers recalled that the Movement has been playing an key active, effective and central role, over the years, on issues of concern and vital importance to its members, such as decolonisation, apartheid, the situation in the Middle East including the question of Palestine, the maintenance of international peace and security, and disarmament. After almost half of a century of its existence, and having undergone many challenges and vicissitudes, it is timely and appropriate to sustain and further consolidate the process of strengthening and revitalising the Movement and undertake actions that allow the Movement to effectively and efficiently counter address the main challenges facing us today. In the context of existing and new threats and challenges, it is imperative for the Movement to continue to promote multilateralism, especially by strengthening the central role of the UN, defending the interests of developing countries and preventing their marginalisation. The Ministers expressed their satisfaction at the performance and achievement of the Movement over the past forty-six - years in preserving and promoting its ideals, principles and purposes as well as in pursuing the collective concerns and interests of its membership. In recognition of the wisdom and far-sightedness of the Founding Fathers, leaders of the Founding Countries and other past leaders of the Movement, they reaffirmed the Movement's commitment to safeguard, uphold and further consolidate its principles, ideals and purposes. 14. In rededicating the Movement to its principles, ideals and purposes, and consistent with the afore-mentioned principled positions, which should be defended, preserved and promoted through greater efforts by the Movement and the existing mechanisms and arrangements of the Movement, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures, among others: 14.1 Continue making progress in the process of revitalizing and strengthening the Movement with a view to achieving the purposes outlined in the Declaration on the Purposes and Principles and the Role of the Non-Aligned Movement in the Present International Juncture, which will enable the Movement to deal effectively with the challenges looming ahead. Consolidate the pro-active approach in the working dynamic of the Movement, maintaining and increasing our capacity to bring forth on behalf of the NAM concrete proposals in the debates and presentation of resolutions and other initiatives at the various United Nations organs and other international fora where NAM is represented. The NAM Plan of Action shall be reviewed when necessary during Ministerial Meetings in order to evaluate its implementation and to update it, accordingly. 14.2 Disseminate the outcome documents of the 15th NAM Ministerial Conference as official documents of the United Nations system, as appropriate. 14.3 Strengthen and manifest the unity and solidarity among the membership of the Movement, particularly with those Non-Aligned Countries which are experiencing external threats of use of force, acts of aggression or unilateral coercive measures, whose peoples are living under colonial or alien domination or foreign occupation, living in abject poverty or suffering ill-health, and victims of natural disasters, bearing in mind that the Movement cannot afford lack of unity and solidarity under those circumstances; 14.4 Sustain the process of reviewing, analysing and strengthening the positions of the Movement on international issues, with a view to further ensure the adherence to and promotion of its Founding Principles and the principles adopted at the 14th Summit, as well as further consolidate the common denominators among its membership; 14.5 Continue to review and redefine the role of the Movement in the context of current realities and improve its structure and methods of work, including through strengthening existing mechanisms and arrangements and, creating new ones, as appropriate, and utilising them to the fullest, convening of regular meetings of such mechanisms and arrangements, generating a more focused and concise documentation, strengthening the role of the Chair as spokesperson of the Movement, working towards establishing a Back-up mechanism to assist the Chair, with the aim to continues promoting a more coordinated, effective and efficient Movement capable of responding in a timely manner to international developments affecting it and its Member Countries; 14.6 Improve the coordination of the work of the existing mechanisms of the Movement in New York, Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna, Paris and The Hague in the work of the relevant UN organs and agencies, upon identifying their respective priority areas of concern and competence, bearing in mind the position of the Coordinating Bureau in New York as the focal point for coordination of the Movement. 14.7 Expand and reinforce the ability and capacity of the Movement for initiative, representation and negotiation, as well as its ethical, political and moral strength and influence; 14.8 Continue to strengthen the coordination and cooperation as well as formulation of common strategies on economic development and social progress issues with the Group of 77 and China (G-77) through the Joint Coordinating Committee of the G-77 and NAM (JCC) in advancing the collective concerns and interests of developing countries at the relevant international forums particularly in the context of UN reform, and in expanding and deepening South-South cooperation. Such coordination must be guided by the Terms of Reference, adopted between both fora in 1994; 14.9 Promote coordination and cooperation between the G-77 and the NAM, wherever possible at all relevant multilateral fora to address issues of common concern to both groupings subject to their respective competencies; 14.10 Expedite its decision-making, in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Cartagena Document on Methodology of the Movement and the Document on the Methodology of the Non-Aligned Movement adopted at the 14th Summit in Havana, through determined and timely action in order to contribute more effectively in the multilateral process, with the aim of enhancing its role and stature as a leading global force; 14.11 Be more proactive in addressing international developments which could adversely impact on the Movement and its Member Countries; 14.12 Encourage the interaction of the Ministers responsible for portfolios of relevance to the Movement, such as food production and agriculture, energy, culture, education, health, human resources, environment, information and communications, science and technology, social progress, women and children, with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of the Movement and increasing the cooperation among its Member Countries in these areas; 14.13 Expand and deepen its interaction and cooperation with parliamentarians, civil society and non-governmental organisations, and the private sector of Non-Aligned Countries on the recognition that they can perform a constructive role towards the attainment of the principles, ideals and purposes of the Movement; and 14.14 Support, as a further manifestation of solidarity of the Movement, the candidatures of Non-Aligned Countries vis-à-vis non member countries, where appropriate, to the United Nations organs and bodies, including the Security Council and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), as well as all subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly and the ECOSOC, bearing in mind the ensuing obligation of such Countries whose candidatures are successful owing to such support, to defend, preserve and promote the concerns and interests of the Movement in those organs and bodies, without prejudice to their sovereign rights. The Ministers also agreed to consider working towards ensuring adequate representation of NAM in all international fora. International Law The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the continued relevance and validity of the Movement's principled positions concerning international law, as follows: 15.1 The Ministers reemphasized that the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the principles of international law are indispensable in preserving and promoting peace and security, the rule of law, economic development and social progress, and human rights for all. In this context, UN Member States should renew their commitment to defend, preserve and promote the UN Charter and international law, with the aim of making further progress to achieving full respect for international law; and 15.2 The Ministers remained concern at the unilateral exercise of extra-territorial criminal and civil jurisdiction of national courts not emanating from international treaties and other obligations arising from international law, including international humanitarian law. In this regard, they condemned the enactment of politically motivated laws at the national level directed against other States, and stressed the negative impact of such measures on the rule of international law as well as on international relations, and called for the cessation of all such measures; 15.3 The Ministers reiterated the need to eliminate unilateral application of economic and trade measures by one State against another that affect the free flow of international trade. They urged States that have and continue to apply such laws and measures to refrain from promulgating and applying them in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law, which, inter alia, reaffirm the freedom of trade and navigation. Recognising the serious danger and threats posed by the actions and measures which seek to undermine international law and international legal instruments, as well as consistent with and guided by the Movement's principled positions thereof, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures, among others: Identify and pursue measures that may contribute towards achieving a peaceful and prosperous world as well as a just and equitable world order based on the UN Charter and international law; Conduct external relations based on the ideals, principles and purposes of the Movement, the UN Charter and international law, as well as the "Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the UN", the "Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security", and the "Declaration on the Enhancement of Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations"; Firmly oppose the unilateral evaluation and certification of the conduct of States as a means of exerting pressure on Non-Aligned Countries and other developing countries; Refrain from recognising, adopting or implementing extra-territorial or unilateral coercive measures or laws, including unilateral economic sanctions, other intimidating measures, and arbitrary travel restrictions, that seek to exert pressure on Non-Aligned Countries - threatening their sovereignty and independence, and their freedom of trade and investment - and prevent them from exercising their right to decide, by their own free will, their own political, economic and social systems, where such measures or laws constitute flagrant violations of the UN Charter, international law, the multilateral trading system as well as the norms and principles governing friendly relations among States; and in this regard, oppose and condemn these measures or laws and their continued application, persevere with efforts to effectively reverse them and urge other States to do likewise, as called for by the General Assembly and other UN organs; request States applying these measures or laws to revoke them fully and immediately; Support, in accordance with international law, the claim of affected states, including the targeted states, to compensation for the damage incurred as a consequence of the implementation of extraterritorial or unilateral coercive measures or laws; Oppose, while reiterating the utmost importance of preserving the delicate balance of rights and obligations of States as stipulated in the various international legally binding instruments to which they are party, the actions by a certain group of States to unilaterally reinterpret, redefine, redraft or apply selectively the provisions of these instruments to conform with their own views and interests and which might affect the rights of their States Parties as defined therein, and in this context, work towards ensuring that the integrity of these instruments is preserved by their States Parties; Oppose all attempts to introduce new concepts of international law aimed at internationalising certain elements contained in the so-called extra-territorial laws of certain States through multilateral agreements; Endeavour to generate further progress to achieve full respect for international law and, in this regard, commend the role of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in promoting the peaceful settlement of international disputes, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the UN Charter and the Statute of the ICJ; Urge the Security Council to make greater use of the ICJ, the principal judicial organ of the UN, as a source of advisory opinions and interpretation of relevant norms of international law, and on controversial issues, further urge the Council to use the ICJ as a source of interpreting relevant international law, and also urge the Council to consider its decisions be reviewed by the ICJ, bearing in mind the need to ensure their adherence to the UN Charter, and international law; Invites also the General Assembly, the other organs of the United Nations and the specialized agencies duly authorized, to request advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice on legal questions arising within the scope of their activities; The Non-Aligned States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) shall continue to preserve the integrity of the Statute and ensure that the ICC remains impartial and fully independent of political organs of the UN, which should not instruct or impede the functions of the ICC, bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute; The Non-Aligned States Parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC call upon those States, which have not yet done so, to consider to ratify or accede to the Rome Statute of the ICC; Participate actively and consistently in the work of the special working group of the Assembly of States Parties of the ICC on the crime of aggression, with a view to achieving an agreed provision thereof for inclusion in the Statute by 2009; The Non-Aligned States continued to underscore the necessity of the independence of the ICC in accordance with its judicial nature. They stated that the Security Council's responsibilities under the Charter of the UN should not limit the role of the Court as a judicial body. The Court should be empowered to pronounce on acts of aggression independently, when the states parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC have reached agreement on the definition of the crime of aggression. Oppose all actions, in particular through the Security Council, aimed at establishing a process to grant immunity to the staff members of UN peacekeeping operations, which violate the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute of the ICC and damage the credibility and independence of the ICC; and Call upon the Non-Aligned States Parties to the relevant treaties to work collectively to increase and enhance their representation and coordination in the bodies established through those treaties, and support the candidatures of their experts as a further manifestation of solidarity among them. Promotion and Preservation of Multilateralism The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning the promotion and preservation of multilateralism and the multilateral process, as follows: 17.1 The Movement reaffirmed that the UN, its Charter, and international law remain indispensable tools and central in the preservation and maintenance of international peace and security and the strengthening of international cooperation. While acknowledging its limitations, the UN, which represents near universal membership and a well-founded international legitimacy, and through it, multilateralism, remains the central multilateral forum for addressing the pressing global issues and challenges presently confronting all States. The responsibility for managing and achieving worldwide economic development and social progress as well as responding to threats to international peace and security must be shared among all States and exercised multilaterally through the UN, which must play the central role thereof; and . 17.2 Remain seized of and active in further deliberations in the UN on the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, bearing in mind the principles of the UN Charter and international law, including respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in their internal affairs, as well as respect for fundamental human rights; 17.3 The Movement also reaffirmed the commitment to discuss and define human security in the UN General Assembly, in conformity with the principles enshrined in the Charter. The Movement stressed that the national ownership and leadership, and capacity building are essential elements in the consideration of this issue. The Movement also affirmed that particular attention should be given to peoples under foreign occupation to ensure their unhindered accessibility to humanitarian assistance and the occupying powers fulfil their obligations under international law and international humanitarian law. 17.4 The Movement reiterated its strong concern at the growing resort to unilateralism and unilaterally imposed measures that undermine the UN Charter and international law, and further reiterated its commitment to promoting, preserving and strengthening multilateralism and the multilateral decision making process through the UN, by strictly adhering to its Charter and international law, with the aim of creating a just and equitable world order and global democratic governance, and not one based on monopoly by the powerful few. The Ministers affirmed the role of South-South cooperation in the overall context of multilateralism and that it is a continuing process, which is vital to confront the threats and challenges facing developing countries in advancing economic development and social progress, promoting and preserving peace and security, and promoting and protecting human rights and the rule of law. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to promote, defend and preserve these positions, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures, among others: 19.1 Promote and work towards creating a multi-polar world through the strengthening of multilateralism through the UN and the multilateral processes, which are indispensable in promoting and preserving the interests of Non-Aligned Countries; 19.2 Initiate further vigorous initiatives to achieve the realisation of multilateral cooperation in the areas of economic development and social progress, peace and security, and human rights for all and the rule of law, including through enhancing the Movement's unity, solidarity and cohesiveness on issues of collective concern and interests with the aim of shaping the multilateral agenda to embrace development as a priority, which should take into account the need for the developing and developed countries, and international institutions to intensify partnerships and coordinate their resources to effectively address all imbalances in the global agenda; 19.3 Work towards achieving a universal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, stressing the value of multilateralism to achieve a balanced, development oriented and, successful conclusion of the Doha round of negotiations, and urge all States to fulfil their commitments to shape globalisation as a positive force and that its benefits are shared evenly by all; 19.4 Strengthen the comparative advantages of existing multilateral arrangements and institutions without compromising the principle of equitable geographical representation and equal partnerships, and promote the democratisation of the system of international governance in order to increase the participation of Non-Aligned Countries in international decision making; 19.5 Oppose unilateralism and unilaterally imposed measures by certain States - which can lead to the erosion and violation of the UN Charter and international law, the use and threat of use of force, and pressure and coercive measures - as a means to achieving their national policy objectives; and 19.6 Strengthen South-South cooperation, including through enhancing the capacities of relevant institutions and mechanisms, as indispensable means to promote and preserve multilateralism and the multilateral process. Peaceful Settlement of Disputes, and Non-Use or Threat of Use of Force The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the Movement's principled positions concerning peaceful settlement of disputes, and non-use or threat of use of force, as follows: 20.1 It is incumbent upon all States to defend, preserve and promote the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the principles of international law, in particular pacific settlement of disputes and the non-use or threat of use of force; and 20.2 The Movement reiterated the basic principle of the UN Charter that all States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The Movement stressed that the UN Charter contains sufficient provisions regarding the use of force to maintain and preserve international peace and security, and that achieving this goal by the Security Council should be strictly done in full conformity with the relevant Charter provisions. Resorting to Chapter VII of the Charter as an umbrella for addressing issues that do not pose a threat to international peace and security must be avoided and in this regard, the Council should fully utilise the relevant Charter provisions, where appropriate, including Chapters VI and VIII. In addition and consistent with the practice of the UN and international law pronounced by the ICJ, Article 51 of the UN Charter is restrictive and that it should not be re-written or re-interpreted. The Ministers expressed their serious concern and complete dismay at the victimisation of innocent civilians in instances where force has been employed or sanctions have been imposed, including those authorised by the Security Council. In the spirit of the UN Charter, they called on all States to advance the principle of the non-use of force and peaceful settlement of disputes as a means of achieving collective security rather than the threat of force or use of force, bearing in mind "that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest" as stipulated in the UN Charter. 22.1 Call upon the international community to renew its commitment to uphold and defend the principles of the UN Charter and international law as well as the means envisaged in the UN Charter for the pacific settlement of dispute and non-resort to the threat or use of force; 22.2 Promote and preserve dialogue among civilizations, culture of peace and inter-faith dialogue, which would contribute towards peace and security, taking into account the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the UN Charter, the Declaration on the Strengthening of International Security, and the Declaration on the Enhancement of Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat of Use of Force in International Relations; 22.3 Strengthen the role of the Movement in peaceful settlement of disputes, conflict prevention and resolution, confidence building, and post-conflict peacebuilding and rehabilitation in or between Non-Aligned Countries, in particular through seriously identifying concrete measures to expedite the creation of a NAM mechanism in this regard, whose terms of reference must be in conformity with its Founding Principles, the UN Charter and international law. Any such mechanism should be based on the consent of the States concerned. 22.4 Oppose and condemn labelling of NAM countries and peoples by certain States through use of pejorative terms as well as systematic vilification of other States to exert political pressure. 22.5 Oppose and condemn the categorisation of countries as good or evil based on unilateral and unjustified criteria, and the adoption of the doctrine of pre-emptive attack, including attack by nuclear weapons by certain States, which is inconsistent with international law, in particular the international legally-binding instruments concerning nuclear disarmament; and further oppose and condemn all unilateral military actions, or use of force or threat of use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Non-Aligned Countries, which constitute acts of aggression and blatant violations of the principles of the UN Charter, including non-interference in the internal affairs of States; and 22.6 Promote, in ensuring international peace and security, the diversity of approaches to development consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law as a core value of the Non-Aligned Countries. Culture of Peace and Dialogue among Civilisations, Religions and Cultures The Ministers noted that the world today is composed of States with diverse political, economic, social and cultural systems and religions determined by their history, traditions, values and cultural diversity, whose stability can be guaranteed by the universal recognition of their right to freely determine their own approach towards progressive development. In this context, they emphasized that respect for the diversity of such systems and approach is a core value which relations and cooperation among States in an increasingly globalising world should be based on, with the aim of contributing to establishing a peaceful and prosperous world, a just and equitable world order, and an environment conducive to exchanging human experiences. They underscored that the promotion of dialogue among civilisations and the culture of peace globally, in particular through the full implementation of the Global Agenda for Dialogue among Civilisations and its Programme of Action and the Declaration and Programme of Action on Culture of Peace could contribute towards that end. The Ministers reaffirmed that dialogue among cultures, civilisations and religions should be a durable process and that, in the current international environment, it is not an option but an imperative, sound and productive tool to promote economic and social development, peace and security, and human rights and the rule of law in guaranteeing a better life for all. They further reaffirmed in this context that tolerance is a fundamental value of international relations. The Ministers, bearing in mind that the current challenges facing international community need to be resolutely addressed by all nations through multilateralism, welcomed the initiative of "Coalition for Peace" based on high ethical values, justice and friendship in order to denounce acts of aggression, and to reinforce and promote stability, tranquillity and durable peace throughout the world. The Ministers recognized the valuable contributions of all religions and beliefs to modern civilization and the contribution that dialogue among civilizations can make to an improved awareness and understanding of common values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence. The Ministers reiterated the need to continue working towards the promotion of dialogue and understanding among civilizations, cultures and religions and reaffirmed their commitment to work together to prevent cultural homogenization and domination or incitement to hatred and discrimination, combating defamation of religion and to evolve better ways of promoting tolerance and respect for and protect (EG) freedom of religion and belief, including the right to preserve one's cultural identity. The relevant UN organs, including the General Assembly, should make positive contributions in that respect and promote much-needed dialogue on those important and sensitive issues. The Ministers recognised the ever-increasing significance and relevance of a culture of living in harmony with nature, which is inherent in nomadic civilisation, in today's world. They, therefore, welcomed the efforts of States to preserve and develop nomadic culture and traditions in modern societies. The Ministers took note of the entry into force on 18 March 2007, of the Convention on the protection and promotion of Diversity of cultural expressions, by UNESCO. They noted with satisfaction that the entry into force of this Convention is a major contribution to the international community in the definition of a framework of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity. The Ministers called on United Nations Member States to consider becoming parties to this Convention. The Ministers welcomed the fruitful efforts of the NAM Member Countries, including the initiatives by the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Republic of Indonesia, the Kingdom of Morocco, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Republic of the Philippines, the State of Qatar and the Republic of Senegal, in exploring the opportunities for co-existence and cooperation between religions and civilisations through ideas and strategies, and holding numerous conferences and forums in order to approach alliances between religions and civilisations, including other inter-governmental processes and initiatives such as the First Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and the High-Level Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace, held on 21 September 2006 in New York. The Ministers also welcomed the Non - Aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity which was held in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, on 3rd and 4th September 2007, reaffirmed their commitment to the Tehran Declaration and Programme of Action (TDPA) adopted therein, and expressed their satisfaction over the establishment of the NAM Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity in Tehran as recommended by the Ministerial Meeting. The Ministers welcomed the convening of the first High Level Dialogue of the General Assembly on Inter-religious and Intercultural Cooperation for Peace held on 4 - 5 October 2007 at the joint initiative of Pakistan and Philippines. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures, among others: 33.1 Emphasize on the need to continue strengthening the dialogue among civilizations, culture of peace and inter-cultural dialogue, inter alia through the World Programme for the Dialogue among Civilizations and the Alliance of Civilizations; 33.2 Oppose all attempts to impose on any State any particular model of political, economic, legal or cultural system, which may lead to global instability and weaken the security of States and their peoples; 33.3 Strive to prevent and mitigate cultural homogenization as well as uniculturalism in the context of globalization, through increased intercultural dialogue and exchange guided by enhancing respect for and observance of cultural diversity, 33.4 Promote a culture of peace based on respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, right to self-determination of peoples under foreign occupation and colonial domination, prevention of violence, promotion of nonviolence, strict adherence to the principles of international relations as enshrined in the UN Charter, and full realisation of the right to development; 33.5 Promote respect for the diversity of religions, beliefs, cultures, prophets, religious symbols and Personalities, as part of the universal respect for peoples and civilizations and common heritage belonging to humankind. 33.6 Welcome the efforts of the Non-Aligned Countries in promoting the culture of peace, and dialogue among civilisations, religions and cultures, including by organising international and regional conferences and forums; 33.7 Also welcome the decision by the Government of the Philippines to host a Special NAM Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development to be held from 26 to 28 May 2009 in Manila, Philippines. 33.8 Initiate discussions with a view to elaborate an international instrument on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance, including ways to eliminate defamation of religions, and discrimination based on religion or belief. 33.9 Contribute to the implementation of the agreements contained in the Tehran Declaration and Programme of Action on Human Rights and Cultural Diversity and, in this context, explore the possibility to promote a NAM initiative on the subject in the Human Rights Council or the United Nations General Assembly. Defamation of Religions The Ministers reaffirmed their strong belief in the need to stress moderation of all religions and beliefs and to promote understanding through dialogue within and across religions. In this connection, they are deeply alarmed at the rising trends of discriminatory national laws and policies adopted and exercised against any religion, stigmatizing groups of people on the basis of religions under variety of pretexts relating to security and illegal immigration, particularly people from certain ethnicities and religious minorities following the events of 11 September 2001. The Ministers, bearing in mind that defamation of religions is being wrongly justified on the ground of the right of freedom of expression, emphasized that everyone has the right to hold opinions without interference and the right to freedom of expression, and that exercise of these rights carries with it special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to limitations as are provided for by law and are necessary for respect of the rights and reputations of others, protection of national security or of public order, public health or morals. The Ministers expressed concern on the negative stereotyping of religions, insults to and defamation of religious personalities, holy books, scriptures and symbols, which impede the enjoyment of human rights including the right to worship and manifest religion without fear of coercion, violence or reprisal. They deplored all acts of ideological and physical violence and assaults, and incitements thereto, against persons on the basis of their religion or belief, and those acts directed against the holy symbols, sites or places of worship of all religions. The Ministers underlined the need to address these disturbing instances through appropriate measures at the national and international level, in conformity with existing instruments of international law. They also underlined the unacceptability of any attempts to restrict the freedom of worship by any religious group in any circumstance. The Ministers underlined the important role of education in the promotion of tolerance and the elimination of discrimination based on religion or belief. Right to Self-Determination and Decolonisation The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning the right to self-determination of peoples under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination, as follows: 38.1 The Movement stressed the fundamental and inalienable right of all peoples, including all non-self governing territories, as well as those territories under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination to self determination, the exercise of which, in the case of peoples under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination, remains valid and essential to ensure the eradication of all these situations and to guarantee universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; 38.2 The Movement reaffirmed the right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence on the basis of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and expressed its unwavering support to the resolutions on Puerto Rico adopted by the UN Special Committee on Decolonisation; and called for their immediate implementation. 38.3 The Movement remained concerned at the loss, destruction, removal, theft, pillage, illicit movement or misappropriation of and any acts of vandalism or damage, directed against cultural property in areas of armed conflict and territories that are occupied. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to preserve, defend and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures, among others: 39.1 Strongly support the work and activities of the UN Special Committee on Decolonisation, and again urge the Administering Powers to grant their full support to the activities of the Committee and fully cooperate with this UN body; 39.2 Request the colonialist countries to pay full compensation for the economic, social and cultural consequences of their occupation, bearing in mind the right of all people who were or are still subjected to colonial rule or occupation to receive fair compensation for the human and material losses they suffered as a result of colonial rule or occupation; 39.3 Strongly condemn the ongoing brutal suppression of the legitimate aspirations to self-determination of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation in various regions of the world; 39.4 Urge UN Member States to fully implement the decisions and resolutions of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) concerning the return of cultural properties to the peoples who were or still under colonial rule or occupation, and in this regard, further urge UNESCO to identify the stolen or illegally exported cultural properties in accordance with the relevant conventions on the subject, and also urge the process of returning these properties to their countries of origin, in compliance with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, be expedited, bearing in mind the right of the Non-Aligned Countries to maintain and conserve their national heritage as it constitutes the foundation of their cultural identity; 39.5 Renew its call to UN Member States to speed up the process of decolonisation towards the complete elimination of colonialism, and including by supporting the effective implementation of the Plan of Action of the Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism (2001-2010); 39.6 Work towards the full implementation of the principle of self-determination with respect to the remaining territories within the framework of the Programme of Action of the Special Committee on Decolonisation, in accordance with the wishes of the people consistent with the UN Charter and the relevant UN resolutions; 39.7 Oppose any attempt aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a State, which is incompatible with the UN Charter; and 39.8 Call on the Government of the United States to assume its responsibility to expedite a process that will allow the Puerto Rican people to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, and urges the Government of the United States to return the occupied land and installations on Vieques Island and at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station to the Puerto Rican people, who constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation. 39.9 Work actively to have the U.N. General Assembly to consider in its 63rd Session the question of Puerto Rico in all its aspects; United Nations: Follow-up to the 2005 World Summit Outcome, the Millennium Declaration and the Outcomes of the Major United Nations Summits and Conferences The Ministers reaffirmed that the UN Charter provides a balance among the purposes and principles of the Organisation that encompass all pertinent issues, including economic and social development, peace and security, and human rights and rule of law, and that the Millennium Declaration as well as the 2005 World Summit Outcome provide the twenty-first century perspective of that balance. They further reaffirmed that the existing, new and emerging threats and challenges faced by all States in these areas are inter-connected and that these could be addressed by acting at a sufficiently early stage with the full range of available peaceful means as envisaged in the UN Charter and in a manner that would ensure the preservation of its purposes and principles, the intergovernmental character of the Organisation and the required balance among its principal organs, as well as the neutrality and impartiality of its undertakings in these areas. The Ministers reiterated their disappointment at the provisions contained in the 2005 World Summit Outcome that did not fully take into account the concerns and interests of developing countries, especially on critical and crucial issues relating to development, official development assistance and trade and they also expressed their disappointment at the lack of implementation by developed countries of many of the commitments on those issues. They further expressed their disappointment at the inability of the World Summit to agree on the issue of disarmament and nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They noted that the World Summit Outcome, in spite of its limitations, could serve as a workable basis for UN Member States to move forward the process of strengthening and updating the UN to meet existing and emerging threats to economic and social development, peace and security, and human rights and the rule of law. They further noted that while the development cluster of the World Summit Outcome fell short of the expectations of developing countries, there were positive elements, which could be used as a platform for actively promoting the implementation of commitments made in previous major UN summits and conferences. The Ministers remained concerned by the lack of and/or uneven progress made by least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States in achieving the internationally agreed development goals including the Millennium Development Goals, and in this regard reiterating the importance of strengthening global partnership in the follow-up to and implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001 - 2010, the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. The Ministers drew particular attention to the decision of some donor countries to establish timetables for the attainment of the 0.7 per cent target of GNP to developing countries by 2015 as ODA and 0.15 per cent to 0.2 per cent to the least developed countries (LDCs) by 2010, and expressed concern at the overall decline in Official Development Assistance in 2006 and 2007. In this regard, they agreed to highlight that the ECOSOC's Development Cooperation Forum as well as the first follow-up Conference to review the implementation of the outcome of the international conference on financing for development should consider the establishment of an effective mechanism to monitor the progress made towards achieving those targets. They once again underlined the need to establish ODA timetables by those developed countries, which have not yet done so, in order to assist developing countries to meet the MDG's target in a timely manner. The Ministers reaffirmed that economic and social development are the centrepiece of the objectives and operational activities of the UN. The achievement of the internationally Agreed Development Goals (IADG), including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), should continue to be the relevant framework of the development activities of the UN system. The Ministers emphasized the importance of the follow-up to the international Conference on Financing for development to review the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus to be held from 29 November to 2 December 2008 in Doha, and resolved to work collectively towards reflecting the interests of developing countries in the outcome of that conference, and called for an active participation in this conference. The Ministers emphasized the need for a timely, effective, comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries and called for the continued formulation of proposals to address significant debt relief for middle-income developing countries including implementation of initiatives. Likewise, they expressed regret at the lack of a more expansive treatment of trade issues and also expressed concern about the inadequate treatment of systemic inequities in international economic relations, in particular the slow progress in enhancing the voice and participation of developing countries in the Bretton Woods Institutions, which operate to the detriment of developing countries. They also drew attention to the importance of ensuring the full implementation of the recommendations, such as those for research and development in science and technology and for strengthening health systems in developing countries. In that context, they also underscored the need to strengthen and the implement development dimension in the series of international economic, financial and trade negotiations, including inter alia on the issue of intellectual property. The Ministers reiterrated the call for the international community, the United Nations system, and international organizations and institutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization, to translate all commitments made at the major United Nations conferences and summits, in the economic, social and related fields into concrete and specific actions in order to, inter alia, achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and calls for the efficient use of monitoring and follow-up mechanisms to ensure that these commitments and actions are effectively implemented; The Ministers emphasizes the need to fully implement the global partnership for development and enhance the momentum generated by the development follow resolution in order to operationalize and implement, at all levels, the commitments in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits, in the economic, social and related fields, and decides to strengthen the existing mechanisms and establishing effective mechanisms to monitor, review and follow up the implementation of the outcomes of all the major United Nations conferences and summits in the social, economic and related fields, and stresses that all countries should promote policies coherent and consistent with the commitments of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including those systemic in nature; The Ministers stressed the need for the United Nations to play a fundamental role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence, coordination and implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and actions agreed upon by the international community, and resolves to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial, trade and development institutions in order to support sustained economic growth, poverty and hunger eradication and sustainable development; The Ministers welcomed the informal High Level Event on the Millennium Development Goals, convened by the Secretary General and the President of the 63rd Session of the General Assembly, to be held on the 25th of September 2008, and called upon the international community to actively engage in the deliberations leading to the review of the progress made, take stock of existing gaps in the achievement of the MDG's, identify actions needed to ensure these goals, including in strengthening international cooperation and to ensure that international targets remain on track and the momentum be maintained . Consistent with, and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to promote, defend and preserve these positions, the Ministers agreed to continue to undertake the following measures, among others: 50.1 Actively engage in the follow-up process and the implementation of the commitments contained in the 2005 World Summit Outcome and its Development Follow up resolution and the Millennium Declaration, as well as the international development goals agreed at the major UN conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields, in a manner that would advance the principled positions of the Movement towards the issues under consideration. To this end, the Movement shall insist, in close cooperation and coordination with the Group of 77 and China, that the follow-up process of these conferences and summits, must remain inclusive, open-ended and transparent in order to ensure that the interests and priorities of the Non-Aligned Countries are duly taken into account in the final outcome of that process; 50.2 Pursue the issues of fundamental importance to the Movement in the context of follow-up to the 2005 World Summit Outcome and the Millennium Declaration, that have been omitted from the outcome document or yet to be explored in the UN such as disarmament, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and arms control; and 50.3 Call for international support for South-South cooperation, including regional and interregional cooperation, which complement North-South cooperation through, inter alia, triangular cooperation. 50.4 Pay particular attention to the outcome of the High Level Event on the Millennium Development Goals, to be held on the 25th of September 2008, as a positive contribution to the achievement of the agreed development goals. 50.5 The Ministers agreed to convene a Special Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to issue of Poverty Eradication before the closure of its 63rd Session United Nations: Institutional Reform A. Reform of the United Nations The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning the institutional reform of the UN, as follows: 51.1 The UN remains the central and indispensable forum for addressing issues relating to international cooperation for economic development and social progress, peace and security, and human rights and the rule of law, based on dialogue, cooperation and consensus-building amongst States. In this context, the Movement attaches great importance to the strengthening of the role of the UN and stresses that efforts should be made to develop its full potential; 51.2 The purpose of reform is to make the UN development system more responsive, efficient and effective in its support to developing countries to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, on the basis of their national development strategies, and that reform efforts should enhance organisational efficiency and achieve concrete development results; 51.3 The reform of the UN, which remains a collective agenda and high priority for the Movement, is a dynamic and ongoing process and not an end in itself in accordance with the parameters for the objective and scope of the review exercise set out by the 2005 World Summit Outcome and the Millennium Declaration. Reform of the UN must be comprehensive, transparent, inclusive and balanced and pursued in an effective and accountable manner, fully respecting the political nature of the Organisation as well as its intergovernmental, universal and democratic character, consistent with the Charter. In this context, the voice of every Member State must be heard and respected during the reform process irrespective of the contributions made to the budget of the Organisation, while stressing that any reform measure should be decided by Member States through an intergovernmental process in accordance with the Charter. 51.4 The Ministers emphasized the need for the payment of assessed contributions by major contributors, which is critical to the financial stability of the Organization, to be made timely, in full and without conditions so as to enable the UN to carry out its mandates effectively. A reformed UN must be responsive to the entire membership, faithful to its founding principles and capable of carrying out its mandate; 51.5 The impact of UN reform on developing countries is yet to be felt given the continuous decline in the resources made available to the UN for multilateral development cooperation. The Ministers underscored the need for a substantially larger allocation of resources to strengthen the development pilar of the United Nations, which includes that Department of Economic and Social Affairs, UNCTAD, Regional Commissions and the Development Account. In this context, the Ministers particularly expressed particular concern at the fact that despite a small increase in funds earmarked for the Development Account, funds available still fall well short of the needs of developing countries. The success of UN reform can only be judged in terms of a collective assessment of the potential improvements in the functioning of the Organisation while preserving the interests of all developing countries. In this context, UN reform shall be strictly approved by the General Assembly and its ultimate goal shall not be to cut in the UN budget and resources. Should reforms however release part of existing resources, such resources shall be ultimately redirected to support activities and programmes related to international cooperation for development; 51.6 The objectives of UN reform, which should include the strengthening of the General Assembly and the ECOSOC as well as reforming the Security Council and other relevant UN bodies while addressing at the same time the systemic issues which may arise as a result, are: to strengthen multilateralism and the multilateral decision-making process, providing the UN with a substantive capacity to fully and effectively meet the purposes and principles enshrined in its Charter, and at consolidating its democratic and inter-governmental character and its transparency in the discussion and implementation of decisions by Member States; to strengthen and update the role of the Organisation, as the pre-eminent and indispensable forum, by developing its full potential in addressing threats and challenges to economic development and social progress, peace and security, and human rights and the rule of law which could be achieved through the implementation of all of its mandates, decisions and resolutions, bearing in mind that a stronger UN that responds more effectively to their collective needs is in their common interest; to promote greater democracy, effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and accountability within the UN system; to strengthen the role of the Organisation in promoting international cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security and in particular for development and in implementing the internationally-agreed development goals, in the economic, social and related fields, including the Millennium Development Goals, through the provision of adequate resources and effective follow-up mechanisms. In this context, any UN reform proposal should also address systemic issues and requirement for additional human and financial resources that may arise as a result; and to mainstream the development dimension within the General Assembly, ECOSOC and the economic sectors of the UN system, including in the areas of sustainable development, policy space, South-South cooperation social and environmental responsibility and accountability, bearing in mind the aim of enabling the full participation of peoples from the South in the international decision and rule-making economic processes, and ensuring their access to and full enjoyment of the benefits of the international economy. 51.7 In acknowledging the interconnectedness of economic and social development, peace and security, and human rights and the rule of law, efforts should be made to ensure that any effort to transform the UN into a more effective instrument for preventing conflict should take into account the need for a balanced coherent and comprehensive approach, in accordance with its Charter and international law, in order to enhance conflict prevention and resolution and post-conflict peace-building strategies with the aim of achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development. In this context, it is critical that all principal organs of the UN play an active role in evolving and implementing a more effective collective security system, in accordance with their respective functions and powers; 51.8 It is indispensable for UN Member States to develop common perceptions and agreed approaches to address existing, new and emerging threats and challenges to international peace and security as well as the root causes of conflict. Such common perceptions and approaches to collective security would only be legitimate if they are developed in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and by all Member States acting together. The active participation of each and every principal organ of the UN is crucial, acting both in the exercise of its respective functions and powers, without upsetting the balance as established by the Charter thereof; and 51.9 Efforts to strengthen the contribution of civil society, non-governmental organisations and the private sector to the work of the UN and its bodies through the established consultative arrangements should continue to be pursued, in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions and should serve the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Such contribution should seek, inter alia, to address in particular the obstacles that developing countries are experiencing in mobilising the resources and in obtaining the technology and capability needed to implement their sustainable development programmes. The Ministers expressed satisfaction over the high level of coordination and activism reached by the JCC, between NAM and G-77 and China, in following up various aspects of the UN reform, which has placed them as key players, also contributing to the advancement of the interests of the developing countries. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to continue pursue the following measures: 53.1 Promote the concerns and interests of developing countries in the reform process, ensure its successful outcome, and promote and preserve the integrity and respective functions and powers of the General Assembly, the ECOSOC, and the Security Council as defined in the Charter; 53.2 Oppose proposals that seek; (a) to transform the democratic and intergovernmental nature of the UN as well as its oversight and monitoring processes including any proposal that seeks to undermine the role of the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly; (b) to impose an artificial cap on budget levels; (c) to fund more activities from within the existing pool of resources; or (d) to redefine the Charter-based functions and powers of its principal organs on budgetary related issues. 53.3 Engage constructively in consultations and work towards, in particular through ensuring the implementation of the relevant UN decisions and resolutions thereof: (a) revitalising the work of the General Assembly, in view of its central role and position as the chief deliberative, policy making and representative organ of the UN; (b) strengthening the role of the ECOSOC as a principal body for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and recommendations on issues of economic and social development, and monitoring the implementation of development programmes; (c) democratising the Security Council as an effective forum in the maintenance of international peace and security; and (d) reforming the Secretariat and its management in order to ensure the efficient and effective implementation of all mandates and to provide the highest level of accountability and transparency, at all levels, within the Secretariat and from the Secretariat to Member States through the establishment of a clear and implementable accountability framework; 53.4 Enhance the global partnership for development that is necessary to fully realize the outcomes of all major UN summits and conferences in the economic, social and related fields; 53.5 Oppose the tendency to equate reform of the UN with greater empowerment of the Security Council, mindful of the need to keep the balance among the functions and powers of the principal organs of the UN; 53.6 Ensure that the UN is provided with sufficient resources and on a timely basis needed to fully implement all mandated programmes and activities, in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions, including evolving a mechanism to monitor their effective implementation; and 53.7 Maintain close inter-governmental oversight and review of all proposals, which are yet to be considered and acted upon by the General Assembly, as well as those, which are being implemented. 53.8 Preserve the unity of purpose and action achieved by NAM and the G-77 and China through the JCC in following up on the various aspects of the UN reform in order for the interests and concerns of developing countries to be adequately reflected in the final outcome of this process. B. Relationship among the Principal Organs of the United Nations The Ministers underscored the need for UN Member States to fully respect the functions and powers of each principal organ of the UN, in particular the General Assembly, and to maintain the balance among these organs within their respective Charter-based functions and powers. They stressed that the Security Council must fully observe all Charter provisions as well as all General Assembly resolutions, which clarify its relationship with the latter organ and other principal organs. In this context, they affirmed that Article 24 of the Charter does not necessarily provide the Security Council with the competence to address issues which fall within the functions and powers of the General Assembly and the ECOSOC, including in the areas of norm-setting, legislation and establishing definitions, bearing in mind that the Assembly is primarily tasked with the progressive development of international law and its codification. The Ministers expressed their grave concern over the increasing and continuing encroachment by the Council on issues which clearly fall within the functions and powers of other principal organs of the UN and their subsidiary bodies. They further stressed that close cooperation and coordination among all principal organs is highly indispensable in order to enable the UN to remain relevant and capable of meeting the existing, new and emerging threats and challenges. The Ministers stressed that while Member States have conferred on the Security Council the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security pursuant to Article 24 (1) of the UN Charter and in carrying out its duties under this responsibility, the Council acts on their behalf. In this context, they further stressed that the Council should report and be accountable to the General Assembly in accordance with Article 24 (3) of the Charter. The Ministers reiterated its concern over the continuing encroachment by the Security Council on the functions and powers of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council through addressing issues which traditionally fall within the competence of the later organs, and the attempts to enter areas of norm-setting and establishing definitions which fall within the purview of the Assembly. 57.1 Urge all States to uphold the primacy of and full respect for the provisions of the UN Charter pertaining to the functions and powers of the Assembly, call on the Presidents of the General Assembly, the ECOSOC and the Security Council to conduct regular discussions and coordination among themselves regarding the agenda and programme of work of the respective principal organs that they represent in order to establish increased coherence and complementarity among these organs in a mutually reinforcing manner, respectful of each others' mandates, and with a view to generating a mutual understanding among them, with whom the members of the respective organs that they represent have vested in good faith their trust and confidence; 57.2 Call on the Security Council to submit a more comprehensive and analytical annual report to the General Assembly, assessing the work of the Council, including such cases in which the Council has failed to act, as well as the views expressed by its members during the consideration of the agenda items under its consideration; 57.3 Call on the Security Council, pursuant to Articles 15 (1) and 24 (3) of the UN Charter, to submit special reports for the consideration of the General Assembly; 57.4 Call on the Security Council to ensure that its monthly assessments are comprehensive and analytical, and issued in a timely fashion. The General Assembly may consider proposing parameters for the elaboration of such assessments; 57.5 Call on the Security Council to fully take into account the recommendations of the General Assembly on matters relating to international peace and security, consistent with Article 11 (2) of the Charter; and 57.6 Oppose and stop attempts to shift issues under the agenda of the General Assembly or the ECOSOC to the Security Council, and the encroachment by the latter on the functions and powers of the Assembly. C. Revitalisation of the Work of the General Assembly The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the principled positions of the Movement concerning the revitalisation of the work of the General Assembly, as follows: 58.1 The role and authority of the General Assembly, including in questions related to international peace and security, as the chief deliberative, policy-making and representative organ of the UN, and its inter-governmental and democratic character as well as that of its subsidiary bodies, which have immensely contributed to the promotion of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the goals of the Organisation, must be respected. Its prerogative as the chief oversight organ of the UN, including on management and procurement for peacekeeping operations, must also be respected; and 58.2 The revitalization of the work of the General Assembly - which must be guided by the principles of democracy, transparency and accountability and achieved through open-ended and inclusive consultations - is a critical component of the comprehensive reform of the UN, and its objectives should continue to strengthen the role and position of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-making and representative organ of the United Nation, bearing in mind that the improvement of its procedural and working methods is only a first step towards a more substantive improvements and revitalization of the Assembly; and to restore and enhance the role and authority of the General Assembly, including in the maintenance of international peace and security as provided for in the Charter, through, inter alia, fully respecting its functions and powers and strengthening its relationship and coordination with other principal organs, in particular the Security Council. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to continue to implement the following measures, among others: 59.1 Support all ongoing and continuous efforts to strengthen the central role and authority of the Assembly, taking into account the criteria of relevance and efficiency; oppose any reform proposal that seeks to challenge the central role and authority of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-making and representative organ of the UN; and oppose any approach that seeks to or could result in undermining or minimizing the achievements of the General Assembly, diminishing its current role and functioning, or raising questions about its relevance and credibility; 59.2 Call on UN Member States to renew their commitment and political will to implement General Assembly decisions and resolutions on a non-selective and non-discriminatory basis, since the failure to do so is at the root of many unresolved questions; 59.3 Ensure that the UN is provided with the resources needed to fully implement all mandated programmes and activities, in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions; 59.4 Reaffirm the role and authority of the General Assembly, including on questions relating to international peace and security, as stipulated in Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 35 of the Charter of the UN, where appropriate using the procedures set forth in rules 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, which enable swift and urgent action by the Assembly, bearing in mind that the Security Council has primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security in accordance with Article 24 of the Charter. 59.5 The Ministers reiterated the role of the General Assembly in the maintenance of international peace and security and expressed grave concern at instances wherein the Security Council fails to address cases involving genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or ceasefire between parties, in fulfilment of its primary responsibility in this regard. 59.6 The Ministers emphasized that in such instances where the Security Council has not fulfilled its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the General Assembly should take appropriate measures in accordance with the Charter to address the issue. To this extent, the Ministers recalled the decision taken at the 14th NAM Summit authorizing representatives of the Movement Member States to the UN in New York to work on an appropriate draft resolution to be submitted to the General Assembly on this issue. 59.7 Promote and preserve the role and mandate of the General Assembly in setting the priorities of the UN and in considering all budgetary and administrative issues and reform, including its absolute authority to allocate and reallocate financial and human resources, and in the appointment of senior officials in the Secretariat in accordance with the Charter and General Assembly resolutions thereof, through ensuring, inter alia, the full adherence by UN Member States to such resolutions; 59.8 Identify measures to simplify the Uniting for Peace procedure to enable swifter and urgent action by the General Assembly, in recognition of its role on issues relating to international peace and security as set out in the Charter; and 59.9 Strengthen the role of the General Assembly in accordance with article 97 of the UN Charter in the selection of the Secretary General of the Organisation. D. Selection and appointment of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The Ministers underlined the central role of the General Assembly in the process of selecting and appointing the Secretary-General of the UN, and expressed support to efforts aimed at reinforcing and strengthening the role of the Assembly in this regard, and agreed that all NonAligned Countries shall engage actively in these efforts. Recalling the role of the principal organs as enshrined in Article 97 of the UN Charter, the Ministers called upon the President of the General Assembly to consult with Member States to identify potential candidates endorsed by a Member State and, upon informing all Member States of the results, forward these results to the Security Council. In this context, the Ministers agreed that formal presentation of candidatures for the position of Secretary-General should be done in a manner that allows sufficient time for interaction with Member States in the General Assembly and the Security Council, and requested that during the selection process of the SG the PGA, convene a meeting of the General Assembly for an exchange of views and dialogue with all candidates. E. Question of Equitable Representation on and Increase in the Membership of the Security Council, and other Matters Related to the Security Council The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council, and other matters related to the Security Council, in particular the directives of the Movement adopted during its 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th Summits, and which have been reflected in the Movement's position and negotiating papers, and the decisions of the Ministerial Conferences and Meetings, as follows: 63.1 The Movement remained concerned at the lack of progress in the discussions in the General on the question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council, and other matters related to the Council, where the discussions therein have shown that while a convergence of views has emerged on a number of issues, major differences still exist on many others, while there have been some improvements made to the working methods of the Council, they have not satisfied even the minimum expectations of the general membership of the UN, leaving much room for improvement; 63.2 In this context, the Movement expressed satisfaction over the adoption of Decision 61/561 on the "Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council and related matters" during the 61st session of the General Assembly; 63.3 Reform of the Security Council should not be confined only to the question of membership and that it should address substantive issues relating to the Council's agenda, working methods and decision-making process; 63.4 In recent years, the Security Council has been too quick to threaten or authorise enforcement action in some cases while being silent and inactive in others. Furthermore, the Council has been increasingly resorting to Chapter VII of the Charter as an umbrella for addressing issues that do not necessarily pose an immediate threat to international peace and security. A careful review of these trends indicates that the Council could have opted for alternative provisions to respond more appropriately to particular cases. Instead of excessive and quick use of Chapter VII, efforts should be made to fully utilize the provisions of Chapters VI and VIII for the pacific settlement of disputes. Chapter VII should be invoked, as intended, as a measure of last resort. Unfortunately, provisions of Articles 41 and 42 in some cases have been too quickly resorted to while the other options had not been fully exhausted; 63.5 The Security Council-imposed sanctions remain an issue of serious concern to NonAligned Countries. In accordance with the UN Charter, sanctions should be considered to be imposed only after all means of peaceful settlement of disputes under Chapter VI of the Charter have been exhausted and a thorough consideration undertaken of the short-term and long-term effects of such sanctions. Sanctions are a blunt instrument, the use of which raises fundamental ethical questions of whether sufferings inflicted on vulnerable groups in the target country are legitimate means of exerting pressure. The objectives of sanctions are not to punish or otherwise exact retribution on the populace. In this regard, the objectives of sanctions regimes should be clearly defined, and that its imposition should be for a specified timeframe and be based on tenable legal grounds, and that it should be lifted as soon as the objectives are achieved. The conditions demanded of the State or party on which sanctions are imposed should be clearly defined and subject to periodic review. Sanctions should be imposed only when there exists a threat to international peace and security or an act of aggression, in accordance with the Charter, and that it is not applicable "preventively" in instances of mere violation of international law, norms or standards. Targeted sanctions may be a better alternative so long as the population of targeted State concerned is not victimised whether directly or indirectly; 63.6 Transparency, openness and consistency are key elements that the Security Council should observe in all its activities, approaches and procedures. Regrettably, the Council has neglected these important factors on numerous occasions. Such instances include unscheduled open debates with selective notification, reluctance in convening open debates on some issues of high significance, repeatedly restricting participation in some of the open debates and discriminating between members and non-members of the Council particularly with regard to sequencing and time limits of statements during the open debates, failure to submit special reports to the General Assembly as required under Article 24 of the Charter, submission of annual reports still lacking sufficient information and analytical content, and lack of minimal parameters for the elaboration of the monthly assessment by the Security Council Presidencies. The Council must comply with the provisions of Article 31 of the Charter, which allow any non-Council member to participate in discussions on matters affecting it. Rule 48 of the Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Council should be thoroughly observed. Closed meetings and informal consultations should be kept to a minimum and as the exception they were meant to be; and 63.7 The objectives of reform of the Security Council, which should be addressed in a comprehensive, transparent and balanced manner, are as follows: to ensure that the agenda of the Council reflects the needs and interests of both developing and developed countries, in an objective, rational, non-selective and nonarbitrary manner; to ensure that the enlargement of the Council, as a body primarily responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security, would lead to a more democratic, more representative, more accountable and more effective Council; to democratise the decision-making process of the Council, including by limiting and curtailing the use of the veto with a view to its eventual elimination and, in this context, the concept of voluntary "self-restraint" is insufficient and cannot be considered as an option. Additional options that could be considered include, inter alia Limiting the exercise of the veto right to actions taken by the Council under Chapter VII of the Charter. The possibility of overruling the veto within the Council by an affirmative vote of a certain number of Member States, commensurate with the size of an expanded Council. The possible overruling of the veto by a two-third majority vote in the General Assembly under the Uniting for Peace procedure and under progressive interpretation of Articles 11 and 24 (1) of the Charter; to ensure that the Rules of Procedure of the Council, which have remained provisional for more than 60 years, are formalised in order to improve its transparency and accountability. 64.1 Call on the Council to increase the number of public meetings, in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter, and that these meetings should provide real opportunities to take into account the views and contributions of the wider membership of the UN, particularly nonCouncil members whose affairs are under the discussion of the Council; 64.2 Call on the Security Council to allow briefings by the Special Envoys or Representatives of the Secretary-General and the UN Secretariat to take place in public meetings, unless in exceptional circumstances; 64.3 Call on the Security Council to further enhance its relationship with the UN Secretariat and troop contributing countries (TCC), including through a sustained, regular and timely interaction. Meetings with TCCs should be held not only in the drawing up of mandates, but also in their implementation, when considering a change in, or renewal of, or completion of a mission mandate, or when there is a rapid deterioration of the situation on the ground. In this context, the Security Council Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations should involve TCCs more frequently and intensively in its deliberations, especially in the very early stages of mission planning; 64.4 Call upon the Security Council to uphold the primacy of and respect for the Charter in connection with its functions and powers and stresses once again that the decision by the Security Council to initiate formal or informal discussions on the situation in any Member State of the United Nations or any issue that does not constitute a threat to international peace and security is contrary to Article 24 of the Charter. 64.5 Call on the Council to establish its subsidiary organs in accordance with the letter and spirit of the UN Charter, and that these organs should function in a manner that would provide adequate and timely information on their activities to the general UN membership; 64.6 Reject any attempts to use the Security Council to pursue national political agendas and stressed the necessity of non-selectivity and impartiality in the work of the Council, and the need for the Council to strictly keep within the powers and functions accorded to it by the Member States under the UN Charter. 64.7 Call on the Council to avoid resorting to Chapter VII of the Charter as an umbrella for addressing issues that do not necessarily pose a threat to international peace and security, and to fully utilise the provisions of other relevant Chapters, where appropriate, including Chapters VI and VIII, before invoking Chapter VII which should be a measure of last resort, if necessary; 64.8 Oppose attempts through the imposition or prolongation of sanctions or their extension by the Security Council against any State under the pretext or with the aim of achieving the political objectives of one or a few States, rather than in the general interest of the international community and 64.9 Urge the Non-Aligned Countries, which are members of the Security Council, to promote and defend, as deemed possible, the aforementioned positions and objectives during their tenure of membership in the Council, and to this end to, while noting the satisfaction recent positive steps in that regard, stress the need for the consolidation of the NAM Caucus in the Council with the principal objective of coordinating and defending the positions of the Movement in the Security Council, and call upon the members of the Caucus to provide timely briefings and to engage in close consultation with the Non-Aligned Countries, particularly those whose interests and concerns are under consideration by the Council, as well as to keep the Movement continuously updated of all relevant developments and issues with which the Council is actively seized. F. Strengthening of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) The Ministers welcomed the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 61/16, which strengthens the role of the ECOSOC as a principal body for the promotion of international economic cooperation, coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and formulation of recommendations on issues of economic and social development as well as for the full implementation of the international development goals agreed at the major UN conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields, including the Millennium Development Goals, and expressed their resolve and commitment to promote greater efforts geared toward this end. They particularly welcomed ECOSOC's role in undertaking regular and periodic review and assessment of international economic and development policies and their impact on development, and called for full implementation of this role. G. The Human Rights Council The Ministers stressed that the Human Rights Council should provide equal treatment to both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, as well as the right to development They further stressed that the Council should not allow confrontational approaches, exploitation of human rights for political purposes, selective targeting of individual countries for extraneous considerations and double standards in the conduct of its work, which should comply with the UN Charter, international law and relevant UN resolutions. The Ministers emphasized that universality, transparency, impartiality, objectivity and nonselectivity, should be guiding principles for the work of the Council and its method of work. The Council in performing its responsibilities should, bear in mind, in accordance with Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds of the Member States. The Ministers emphasized the importance of constructive approach in the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in this regard, they urged the Human Rights Council to focus on constructive international dialogue and cooperation, capacity building and technical assistance to ensure the realisation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to development. The Ministers welcomed the adoption of Resolution 62/219 by the General Assembly on 22 December 2007, endorsing the Human Rights Council's decision to adopt resolution 5/1 entitled Institutional Building of the Human Rights Council and resolution 5/2 entitled Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-Holders of the Human Rights Council, including their annexes and appendixes. The Ministers emphasized the need to evolve effective working relationship between the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in line with the spirit of General Assembly resolution 48/141. They further stressed that the Human Rights Council, being the expert inter-governmental body on human rights issues, should have an oversight role in reviewing the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, including its activities under country engagement and establishing its field offices. The Ministers reiterated that the Non-Aligned Movement should continue to closely coordinate its position on the following priority areas: a) Foster international cooperation and constructive dialogue in the Human Rights Council and prevent the occurrence of practices of double standards, selectivity and political manipulation which discredited the Commission on Human Rights. b) Continue the review, rationalization and improvement, as appropriate, of all existing mandates, special procedures, expert bodies and the confidential procedure, bearing in mind that in discharging their mandates, the mandate holders should be guided by and observe, the Code of Conduct for the Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the Human Rights Council contained in HRC Resolution 5/2 of 18 June 2007, so as to enhance the effectiveness of the system c) Encourage the presentation of experts from NAM countries as candidates for special procedures mandate-holders, d) Develop the relationship of the Human Rights Council with other entities of the United Nations system, as appropriate, in accordance with the General Assembly resolutions 48/141, 60/251 and 62/219. e) Determine the Council's reporting procedures to the United Nations General Assembly, for purposes of universal endorsement of all its programs and activities, in its capacity as subsidiary organ of the General Assembly. f) Ensure that the Universal Periodic Review be conducted by the Human Rights Council as a result-oriented, cooperative mechanism, based on an interactive dialogue, with the full involvement of the country concerned and with consideration given to its capacity-building needs and that such a mechanism shall complement and not duplicate the work of treaty bodies, bearing in mind the need to eradicate selectivity, double standards and politicisation in the consideration of human rights issues. It should aim at strengthening the Member States capacity, upon their request, to implement their obligations, on promotion and protection of human rights. It should not be used as a tool to coerce States and subject them to politically motivated country-specific resolutions. g) Review modalities for consultation between the Human Rights Council, as mandated by General Assembly resolution 60/251, and NGOs in order to streamline their activities, based inter alia on ECOSOC resolution 1996/31, taking into consideration that NGOs should conform at all times to the principles governing the establishment and nature of their consultative relations with ECOSOC, and that they are responsible for the actions of their accredited representatives during their participation in the work of the Human Rights Council; The Ministers emphasized the role of the Human Rights Council as the United Nations organ responsible for consideration of human rights situations in all countries in the context of the Universal Periodic Review based on cooperation and constructive dialogue. The Ministers expressed their deep concern over the continuation of the practice of selective adoption of country - specific resolutions in the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, which breaches the principles of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in addressing human rights issues which undermine cooperation as the essential principle to effectively promote and protect all universally recognized human rights for all. H. Post-Conflict Peacebuilding Activities and the Operationalisation of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) The Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) recalled the 14th Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement held in Havana, Cuba September 2006 at which the Heads of State or Government of the Movement reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning post-conflict peacebuilding activities and had welcomed the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) as by General Assembly resolution 60/180; as a coordinated, coherent and integrated institutional mechanism, to address the special needs of countries emerging from conflict, towards recovery, reintegration and reconstruction at their request in accordance with the principle of national ownership", in laying the foundation for sustainable development. In pursuit of this mandate, the Ministers reaffirmed the Non-Aligned Movement's commitment to an efficient and effective Peacebuilding Commission, which fully utilises the advantages and benefits arising from the diversity of its composition. In this context, they noted the first report of the Commission, as contained in document A/62/137-S/2007/458. They also acknowledged the work undertaken by the Commission in its first year of operation with respect to the first two countries on its agenda, namely Burundi and Sierra Leone. In addition, they welcomed the recent decisions made by PBC in response to the respective requests of Guinea-Bissau and Central African Republic to be included on the commission's agenda. The Ministers welcomed the establishment of a NAM Caucus within the Peacebuilding Commission aimed at coordinating positions of Non-Aligned countries in the Commission and to keep the Movement informed of the activities carried out by the Commission. In this connection, they lauded the efforts of the Caucus in the rapid progress of the Commission, specifically towards the entrenchment of the principle of national ownership, the need for capacity building and drawing recognition to, and signalling the importance of the economic recovery and development dimension in the peace building process. The Ministers expressed concern at several instances in which the Security Council denied the coordinator of the NAM Caucus in the PBC an opportunity to address members of the Security Council on matters related to the competence of the PBC. They urged the Security Council, the General Assembly and ECOSOC to utilize the expertise of the PBC, including the coordinator of the NAM Caucus of the PBC, as the representative of the largest grouping within the PBC, by ensuring participation in discussions on all issues of relevance to, or falling within, the competence of the PBC. Furthermore, they stressed on the necessity to promote the institutional relation between the PBC and the General Assembly, the Security Council and the ECOSOC. The Ministers reiterated that, without prejudice to the functions and powers of the other principal organs of the UN in relation to post-conflict peacebuilding activities, the General Assembly must play the key role in the formulation and implementation of such activities and functions. They underlined the central role of the PBC in providing the United Nations with policy guidance and strategies in its post-conflict peacebuilding activities. In this regard they reaffirmed the work of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission as the central organ of the Commission, with responsibilities as described in the General Assembly's resolution 60/180. As well as considering the organizational committee a suitable platform for strategy and policy discussions to promote the rules and working methods of the Commission and to reinforce the coherence of the Commission's Configurations and to facilitate a result oriented engagement with relevant actors and stakeholders. In this connection also, they urged the NAM Caucus in the Commission to encourage work towards the further development of rules of procedure and methods of work, suitable for the efficient and proper functioning of the Commission. They emphasized that the provisional rules of procedure of the PBC need to be regularly revisited in the light of the experience gained by the Commission since its operationalization, and the developments in the work of the Commission. The Ministers emphasized that the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) must continue to be used as a catalytic support mechanism geared towards providing critical support during the early stages of the peace building process to avert relapse into conflict. They stressed the importance of further enhancing understanding of the relationship between the Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding Fund, and creating closer strategic ties between the activities of the Commission and the use of the Fund as well as the engagement of the PBC in the review process which is to be held by the General Assembly on the terms of reference of the PBF no later than two years from its establishment. The Ministers encouraged the continued coordination of positions of the Non-Aligned countries within the framework of the NAM Caucus in the PBC and requested the Caucus to continue its efforts to strengthen the position and the role of the Movement in the affairs of the PBC and continue to keep the Coordinating Bureau of the Movement abreast of the activities undertaken by the Commission, on a regular basis. They further encouraged the Non-Aligned members of the Peace-building Commission and the Non - Aligned countries which are on its agenda, to actively participate in the NAM Caucus to ensure its purposeful contribution to the peace-building activities of the United Nations. I. Review of Mandates of United Nations Programmes and Activities The Ministers reiterated the Movement's principled position regarding the review of mandates of the United Nations programme and activities, as contained in the Final Document of the 14th NAM Summit in Havana, as well as the joint letter signed by the Chairs of NAM and the Group of 77 and China, issued as an official document of the United Nations (A/61/693). The Ministers stressed that the mandates review process should be aimed at strengthening the programme of work of the Organisation in order to make it better equipped to effectively deliver its mandates, old and new, not a cost-cutting one. They underscored the importance of assessing the implementation of the mandates of the Organisation, and the reasons behind their partial or non-implementation, in order to make a well-informed decision regarding each single mandate under consideration. They emphasized that review of mandates should fully respect the politically sensitive mandates, and to reach agreement in principle on the manner by which the mandates are going to be addressed prior to reaching any decision concerning them. They further stressed that such an exercise should adhere to the principle of consideration on a case-by-case basis in a manner that addresses the political nature of the issue, while respecting other pertinent and parallel efforts undertaken by the General Assembly. The Ministers reiterated their rejection of efforts by some parties to pursue the integration of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) under the mandate of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. They maintained that the mandates and objectives of the two Agencies differ and that the mere intention to merge them is completely rejected in light of the long-standing and unique situation of the Palestine refugees. The Ministers affirmed that the UNRWA, since its establishment by General Assembly resolution 302 (IV) of 8 December 1949, has played an essential role in ameliorating the plight of the Palestine refugees and that its continued operation is essential for the well-being of the Palestine refugees throughout the region as well as for the stability of the region as a whole, pending the achievement of a just resolution to the question of the Palestine refugees. In this regard, they further affirmed that the critical issue of the functioning of UNRWA involves not only the provision of vital humanitarian assistance to Palestine refugees throughout the host countries but also a complex political dimension. The Ministers thus reaffirmed their strong and continued support for the mandate of UNRWA until the achievement of a just and lasting resolution to the plight of the Palestine refugees in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948. The Ministers also rejected proposals aimed at discontinuing programmes of great importance to developing countries, in particular, the Regular Programme for Technical Cooperation. The Ministers stressed in this regard that review of mandates related with development clusters, in particular Africa's development should not entail any discontinuation of these mandates, but rather an assessment to the effectiveness of their implementation which will constitute an important input to the forthcoming High Level Meeting on MDG's, to be held in New York in September 2008. J. United Nations Secretariat and Management Reform Recognising that the reform of the UN is a collective agenda of its membership, the Ministers stressed that the voice of every Member State must be heard and respected during the reform process, irrespective of its level of contribution to the budget of the Organisation. The Ministers recognized that in order to advance the reform process of the Secretariat and Management, the United Nations must be equipped with the necessary and sufficient resources to allow its full implementation, avoiding any delay in this task. The Ministers reiterated that the objectives of the reform of the Secretariat of the UN and its management are as follows: to respond more efficiently and effectively to the needs of Member States; to further strengthen and update the role, capacity, effectiveness and efficiency of the UN and thus, improving its performance in order to realize the full potential of the Organisation, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter; to ensure the effective enforcement of greater accountability and transparency measures within the Secretariat as well as accountability of the Secretariat towards Member States in particular at the senior managers level; To better reflect the international character of United Nations Secretariat as a fundamental principle through obtaining the agreed benchmarks on equitable geographic representation at all levels of the Secretariat, including senior managerial level, as well as to achieve the targeted gender balance among all staff members. The final result of the reform process should be to ensure that the UN is able to implement all its mandates more effectively and efficiently. The Ministers emphasized that the reform of the Secretariat of the UN and its management should not: change the intergovernmental nature of the decision-making, oversight and monitoring processes of the Organisation; be a cost-cutting exercise of the Organisation; reduce the budget levels of the Organisation; fund more activities from within the existing pool of resources of the Organisation; and redefine the functions and powers of the principal organs of the Organisation. The Ministers strongly rejected attempts to impose conditionalities to the reform process which negatively impact the confidence atmosphere needed for the negotiations. K. United Nations System-wide Coherence The Ministers reiterated their willingness to continue to engage constructively in the process set up by the President of the General Assembly to facilitate an intergovernmental consideration of the recommendations emanating from the High-Level Panel's Report and the Secretary-General's comments. The Ministers reaffirmed all the general elements stated by the Joint Coordinating Committee of G-77 and NAM during the plenary meetings of the General Assembly on system wide coherence and in its letter of 19 March 2007, including the following: The Ministers reiterated their preference of an integrated process instead of a divided one. Funding, development and governance continue to be areas of priority interest for the JCC. The Ministers understand that all areas of the High Level Panel's Report are going to be discussed before a final decision is reached and at that point they will have a single comprehensive decision. The Ministers also reiterated their position that development cooperation should be demand-driven and be pursued on the basis of the national strategies and plans of developing countries. In this regard, they emphasized that UN development cooperation should be voluntary and grant-based in nature and that there should be no "one size-fits all" approach. Likewise, they highlighted that the nature of development cooperation should be responsive to the specific needs, priorities and conditions of each country. The Ministers acknowledged that General Assembly resolution 62/208 on the Triennial comprehensive policy review operational activities for development of the United Nations system constitutes the intergovernmental agreed guiding policy framework for addressing the UN operational activities for development. The Ministers underscored that the fundamental characteristics of the UN operational activities for development must remain, inter alia, the universal, voluntary and grant nature, the neutrality and the multilateralism, as well as their ability to respond to the development needs of program countries in a flexible manner. The Ministers commended the effective coordination between NAM and G-77, through the Joint Coordinating Committee, in the consultations on the System-wide Coherence, and in this regard undertook to continue to work together with the G-77, through the JCC, with a view to defend, preserve and promote the interests of developing countries and defend the integrated, intergovernmental, inclusive and transparent nature of this process, without the imposition of artificial deadlines for decision-making. United Nations: Financial Situation and Arrangement The Ministers reiterated the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning the financial situation and arrangement of the UN, as contained in the Final Document of the 14th NAM Summit as follows: 93.1 The Movement remained concerned at the financial situation of the UN as a result of the failure on the part of some Member States, especially major contributing States, to meet their assessed contributions in full, on time and without conditions, in accordance with the Charter and relevant General Assembly resolutions; 93.2 The Movement reiterated that it remains crucial to ensure that all decisions on the priority-setting of the UN are adopted in an inclusive and transparent manner, and that the Organisation should be provided with the resources needed for the full and effective implementation of all mandated programmes and activities as well as those required to guarantee the quality of services needed for the functioning of its inter-governmental machinery; 93.3 The principle of capacity to pay of Member States should remain as a fundamental criterion in the apportionment of the expenses of the Organisation; 93.4 The general principles governing the financing of UN peacekeeping operations, as set out in the relevant General Assembly resolutions, should be adhered to. A proper balance should be struck between the level and urgency with which peacekeeping activities are funded on the one hand, and availability of resources needed for full implementation of all mandated programmes and activities by the General Assembly, in particular in the area of development, on the other; and 93.5 To strike a balance in reflecting the agreed priorities of the Organization in the allocation of resources to the United Nations regular budget; which is persistently to the detriment of the development activities. 93.6 The existing reporting procedures on budget and financial cycle should be maintained and the role of the Member States in programme evaluation of the Organisation should be strengthened. In this regard, the functions of the Committee on Program and Coordination (CPC), as the main subsidiary of ECOSOC and the General Assembly for planning, programming and coordination and its vital role in program design by ensuring that the Secretariat accurately interprets and translates legislative mandates into programs and subprograms should be further strengthened. The Ministers reaffirm that the financial stability of the UN should not be jeopardized by any arbitrary measure. They also stressed that measures to ensure financial discipline should be done in full compliance with relevant General Assembly resolutions, in particular 41/213 and 42/211, as well as relevant rules and regulations of the Organization. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to reiterate the following measure, among others: 95.1 Urge all UN Member States in arrears, in particular the major contributing States, to settle their outstanding dues without further delay and to pay their future assessments in full, on time and without imposing preconditions in accordance with the Charter and relevant General Assembly resolutions, mindful at the same time of the special situation faced by some developing countries that hamper their ability to pay their assessed contributions. United Nations: Peacekeeping Operations The Ministers reaffirmed the guiding principles of United Nations peacekeeping operations (UNPKOs) adopted at the 11th Ministerial Conference of NAM held in Cairo in 1994, and reiterated the Movement's position on UNPKOs adopted by the 12th Summit held in Durban in 1998, and which have been further reiterated at the 13th Summit held in Kuala Lumpur in 2003, the 14th Ministerial Conference held in Durban in 2004 and the 14th Summit held in Havana in September 2006. The Ministers commended the Movement's significant and major contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security under the auspices of the United Nations. Noting that peacekeeping has become the flagship activity of the Organisation, the Ministers expressed satisfaction that the Non-Aligned Countries currently provide more than 80% of peacekeeping personnel in the field. They reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning UNPKOs, as follows: 97.1 The Ministers reiterated that the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security rests with the UN and that the role of regional arrangements, in that regard, should be in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter, and should not in any way substitute the role of the UN, or circumvent the full application of the guiding principles of UNPKOs; 97.2 The Ministers emphasized that the establishment of any peacekeeping operation or extension of mandate of existing operations should strictly observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and those principles that have evolved to govern such operations and have become basic principles thereof, namely the consent of the parties, the non-use of force except in self-defence and impartiality. The Ministers believed that these basic principles have guided UN peacekeeping operations over the last five decades without controversy, still remain relevant and should be preserved. The Ministers also emphasized that the respect for the principles of sovereign equality, political independence, territorial integrity of all States and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within their domestic jurisdiction should also be upheld in this regard. 97.3 The Ministers continued to emphasize that UN peacekeeping operation should be provided from the outset with political support, adequate human, financial and logistical resources, and clearly defined and achievable mandates and exit strategies; 97.4 The Ministers called upon the Security Council, while mandating UNPKOs, to authorise optimal troop strengths in order to achieve the mandated tasks; 97.5 The Ministers stressed that UNPKOs should not be used as a substitute for addressing the root causes of conflict, which should be addressed in a coherent, well-planned, coordinated and comprehensive manner, with other political, social, economic and developmental instruments. They further maintained that consideration should be given by the UN to the manner by which those efforts can continue without interruption after the departure of UNPKOs, so as to ensure a smooth transition to lasting peace and security; 97.6 The Ministers, while recognising the ongoing surge in peacekeeping which requires a genuine and concerted response by the entire membership of the UN, in particular the developed countries, called upon these countries to participate in and share the burden of UNPKOs; 97.7 The Ministers emphasized that in the context of the comprehensive approach and the objective of a lasting peace and security, UN peacekeeping operations should be accompanied by a parallel and inclusive peace process that is well planned and carefully designed, supported by the consent and adherence of the parties concerned. 97.8 The Ministers reaffirmed that the General Assembly has the primary role within the UN in formulating concepts, policies and budgetary matters related to peacekeeping. In this regard, the Ministers emphasized that the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations is the only UN forum mandated to review comprehensively the whole question of UNPKOs in all their aspects. Further, the Ministers agreed to continue to promote and safeguard the collective positions and priorities of the Movement on peacekeeping. 97.9 The Ministers stressed that the UN's engagement in increasingly demanding and complex multidimensional peacekeeping operations should be consistent with the agreed principles, guidelines and terminology governing peacekeeping. They emphasized the importance of consistency in the use of agreed peacekeeping terminology and underlined that any discussion of the above should be done through the inter-governmental process; 97.10 The Ministers, while taking note of the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping (DPKO) and establishment of the Department of Field Support (DFS), emphasized the importance of preserving unity of command in mission at all levels, as well as coherence in policy and strategy, and clear command structures in the field and up to, and including, at headquarters; 97.11 The Ministers called upon the UN Secretariat and concerned parties to accord the highest priority to the safety and security of UN peacekeepers in the field in light of the worsening security situation prevailing in many field missions. In this context, they condemned in the strongest terms the killing and targeted attacks of UN peacekeepers, and all acts of violence against them; 97.12 The Ministers stressed that Troops Contributing Countries (TCCs) should be involved early and fully, in all aspects and stages of UNPKOs and called for more frequent and substantive interaction among the Security Council, the UN Secretariat and the TCCs. They called for the full and effective implementation of the existing mechanisms laid down in Security Council Resolution 1353 (2001) and in the Note of the President of the Security Council dated 14 January 2002 (S/2002/56); 97.13 The Ministers expressed the view that further development of the mechanisms, referred to in paragraph 95.12 above, towards achieving peacekeeping objectives should be considered; 97.14 The Ministers underscored in particular that the experience and expertise of troop contributing countries can be drawn upon when the Security Council implements, extends or adjusts UN peacekeeping mandates. Troop contributing countries are best placed to contribute to an objective assessment of the situation on the ground. In this regard, enhanced and better interaction between Troop Contributing Countries and the Security Council Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations could also contribute to a more inclusive consultation and decision making process. 97.15 The Ministers emphasized that any invitation by the UN Secretariat to the meetings on establishing a new UN peacekeeping mission or expanding an ongoing UNPKO should be transparent and encompass all Troop Contributing Countries. 97.16 The Ministers expressed support for continuing efforts to strengthen African peacekeeping capabilities, and emphasized the importance of implementing the Joint Action Plan for United Nations Support to the African Union Peacekeeping in the short, medium and long term. 97.17 The Ministers remained concerned over the staffing and structure of the Department of peacekeeping Operations and Department of Field support whereby NAM Member Countries are insufficiently represented, particularly at professional level. The Ministers urged the Secretary General to enhance his efforts in accordance with General Assembly resolutions to address the current imbalance of geographic representation, and the representation of unrepresented and underrepresented Troops Contributing Countries (TCCs) in particular at the professional and leadership level in the DPKO and DFS as well as in the field missions. 97.18 The Ministers stressed the importance of the rapid and effective deployment of the UNPKOs including their reinforcement as necessary. In this regard, the Ministers stressed the need for enhanced rapidly deployable capacities for UN peacekeeping missions in crisis. Such a mechanism needs to be developed in close consultation with TCCs. 97.19 The Ministers reaffirmed that the funding of UNPKOs through voluntary contributions should not influence the UN Security Council decisions to establish UNPKOs or affect their mandates; 97.20 The Ministers expressed concern over the significant amounts of outstanding reimbursements that the United Nations currently owes to the Troop Contributing Countries, which may adversely affect the UN peacekeeping capacity. 97.21 The Ministers noted the positive outcome of the 2008 session of the UN Contingent Owned Equipment Working Group although they believe that there is a need for the increase in reimbursement rates of COE to be based on actual expenses and investments. They stressed the need to review Troop Cost which has not been revised since 2002. 97.22 The Ministers stressed again that all UN Member States must pay their assessed contributions in full, on time and without condition. They reaffirmed the obligation of Member States, under article 17 of the UN Charter, to bear their expenses to the Organisation as apportioned by the General Assembly, bearing in mind the special responsibility of the Permanent Members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963; 97.23 The Ministers reemphasized the critical importance of timely, efficient, transparent and cost-effective procurement of goods and services in support of UNPKOs, and reiterated the view that there is a need to ensure greater UN procurement from Non-Aligned Countries; 97.24 The Ministers acknowledged the outstanding contribution and sacrifices of peacekeepers and stressed that all UN peacekeeping personnel perform their duties in a manner that preserve the image, credibility, impartiality, and integrity of the UN. They stressed the importance of maintaining a policy of zero tolerance on all forms of misconduct, including sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping missions. 97.25 The Ministers emphasized that due process and national requirements must always be observed during investigations of misconduct. They further stressed that the UN should ensure that steps are taken to restore the image and credibility of any UN peacekeeping mission, Troop Contributing Countries or UN peacekeeping personnel when allegations of misconduct are ultimately found to be unproven. The Ministers urged the implementation of the Revised Draft Model Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) adopted by the General Assembly. The Ministers welcomed the valuable contribution of the Movement members that led to the adoption of a focused, action oriented comprehensive strategy on assistance and support to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by United Nations staff and related personnel. 97.26 The Ministers noted the importance of security sector reform (SSR) among other important components in the context of UN peacekeeping and post conflict situations, and stressed that SSR should be integrated in the broad framework of UN Rule of Law activities, thus ensuring that SSR activities and structures are not duplicating the work carried out in the Rule of Law area. They reaffirmed that the development of a UN approach to SSR must take place within the General Assembly, and stressed that the formulation of strategies to SSR, including its scope and mandate, should be carried out through the intergovernmental process. 97.27 The Ministers emphasized that SSR should be undertaken at the request of the country concerned, and underlined the primary responsibility and the sovereign right of the country concerned in determining its national priorities in this regard; 97.28 The Ministers, deeply aware of the risks inherent in peacekeeping, reserved their most profound thoughts and respect for those UN peacekeepers that have lost their lives while in the service of peace. 97.29 The Ministers commended the ongoing work of the NAM Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations, under the chairmanship of Morocco, in coordinating issues of common concern to the Movement in the field of peacekeeping. They encouraged all NAM delegations to continue to actively participate in the working group with a view to promote and achieve the objectives of the Movement, in particular the Troop Contributing Countries, in the work of the Special committee on Peacekeeping Operations. Disarmament and International Security The Ministers reaffirmed and reiterated the long-standing principled positions of the Movement on disarmament and international security, including the decisions taken at the XII Summit in Durban in 1998, the XIII Summit in Kuala Lumpur in 2003, the 14th Summit in Havana in 2006, the XIII Ministerial Conference in Cartagena in 2000, the XIV Ministerial Conference in Durban in 2004 and the Ministerial Meeting held in Putrajaya, Malaysia, in May 2006. The Ministers reiterated their continued grave concern over the current difficult and complex situation in the field of disarmament and international security. In this regard, they called for renewed efforts to resolve the current impasse in achieving nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation in all its aspects. While reaffirming the absolute validity of multilateral diplomacy in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation, the Ministers reiterated their determination to promote multilateralism as the core principle of negotiations in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation, and in this regard, they welcomed the adoption of General Assembly Resolution 62/27 on Promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. The Ministers reiterated their strong concern at the growing resort to unilateralism and in this context, underlined that multilateralism and multilaterally agreed solutions, in accordance with the UN Charter, provide the only sustainable method of addressing disarmament and international security issues. The Ministers reaffirmed the Movement's principled positions on nuclear disarmament, which remains its highest priority, and on the related issue of nuclear non-proliferation in all its aspects and stressed the importance that efforts aiming at non-proliferation should be parallel to simultaneous efforts aiming at nuclear disarmament. They stressed their concern at the threat to humanity posed by the continued existence of nuclear weapons and of their possible use or threat of use. They reiterated deep concern over the slow pace of progress towards nuclear disarmament and the lack of progress by the Nuclear Weapons-States (NWS) to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals. They underscored the need for the NWS to implement the unequivocal undertaking that they provided in 2000 so as to accomplish the total elimination of nuclear weapons and emphasized, in this regard, the urgent need to commence negotiations on nuclear disarmament without delay. The Ministers remained deeply concerned at strategic defence doctrines of NWS, including the "NATO Alliance Strategic Concept", which not only set out rationales for the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, but also maintain unjustifiable concepts on international security based on promoting and developing military alliances and nuclear deterrence policies. The Ministers reiterated that the improvement in the existing nuclear weapons and the development of new types of nuclear weapons as envisaged in the United States Nuclear Posture Review contravene the security assurances provided by the NWS. They further reaffirmed that these improvements as well as the development of new types of such weapons violate the commitments undertaken by the NWS at the time of the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The Ministers emphasized that progress in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects is essential to strengthening international peace and security. They reaffirmed that efforts toward nuclear disarmament, global and regional approaches and confidence building measures complement each other and should, wherever possible, be pursued simultaneously to promote regional and international peace and security. The Ministers reaffirmed the importance and the relevance of the UN Disarmament Commission (UNDC) as the sole specialised, deliberative body within the UN multilateral disarmament machinery. They continued to fully support the work of the UNDC and expressed regret that UNDC was unable to reach agreement on recommendations on its two agenda items during substantive sessions of its three-year cycle ending in April 2008 due to the lack of political will and inflexible positions of certain Nuclear Weapons States, despite NAM's constructive role and concrete proposals throughout the deliberations, especially in the Working Group on "Recommendations for achieving the objective of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons". The Ministers called upon UN Member States to display the necessary political will and flexibility in order to achieve agreement on its agenda during the next cycle. The Ministers reaffirmed the importance of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament, and reiterated their call on the CD to agree on a balanced and comprehensive program of work by, inter alia, establishing an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament as soon as possible and as the highest priority. They emphasized the necessity to start negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons with a specified framework of time, including a Nuclear Weapons Convention. They reaffirmed the importance of the unanimous conclusion of the ICJ that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control. The Ministers reiterated their support for the convening of the Fourth Special Session of the UN General Assembly devoted to Disarmament (SSOD-IV) and further reiterated their deep concern over the lack of consensus on the deliberations to consider the objectives and agenda of SSOD-IV. Appreciating the role of the Chair of the open-ended working group in 2007, selected from NAM, the Ministers recalled the concrete proposals and the consistent and constructive efforts of the Movement to reach agreement among all UN Member States. They regretted the lack of political will of a certain State in obstructing consensus. The Ministers reiterated the importance of satisfactorily concluding the work of the open-ended working group on SSOD-IV, at an early date, as mandated by the General Assembly with a view to reaching agreement on the objectives and agenda of SSOD-IV, including the possibility of establishing its preparatory committee. The Ministers again called for an international conference to identify ways and means of eliminating nuclear dangers, at the earliest possible date, with the objective of arriving at an agreement on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons with a specified framework of time to eliminate all nuclear weapons, to prohibit their development, production, acquisition, testing, stockpiling, transfer, use or threat of use, and to provide for their destruction. The Ministers reaffirmed that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and reaffirmed further that non-NWS should be effectively assured by NWS against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. Pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, they called for the conclusion of a universal, unconditional and legally binding instrument on security assurances to non-NWS as a matter of priority. They noted the establishment in 1998 of an Ad Hoc Committee on effective international arrangements to assure Non-nuclear-weapons States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons in the Conference on Disarmament to negotiate universal, unconditional and legally binding security assurances to all non-NWS. The Ministers stressed the significance of achieving universal adherence to the CTBT, including by all NWS, which, inter alia, should contribute to the process of nuclear disarmament. They reiterated that if the objectives of the Treaty were to be fully realized, the continued commitment of all States signatories, especially the NWS, to nuclear disarmament would be essential. The Ministers, while noting the entry into force of the 2002 Moscow Treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States, stressed that reductions in deployments and in operational status cannot substitute for irreversible cuts in, and the total elimination of, nuclear weapons, and called on the United States and the Russian Federation to apply the principles of transparency, irreversibility and verifiability to further reduce their nuclear arsenals, both warheads and delivery systems, under the Treaty. The Ministers continued to be concerned over the negative implications of the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defence systems and the threat of weaponization of outer space which have, inter alia, contributed to the further erosion of an international climate conducive to the promotion of disarmament and the strengthening of international security. The abrogation of the ABM Treaty brings new challenges to strategic stability and the prevention of the arms race in outer space. They remained concerned that the implementation of a national missile defence system could trigger an arms race(s) and the further development of advanced missile systems and an increase in the number of nuclear weapons. The Ministers recognized the common interest of all mankind in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and emphasized that prevention of an arms race in outer space, including a ban to deploy or use weapons therein, would avert a grave danger for international peace and security. They further emphasized the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitation and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space, including bilateral agreements, and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space. They also emphasized the urgent need for the commencement of substantive work in the CD on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. The Ministers remained convinced of the need for a multilaterally negotiated, universal, comprehensive, transparent, and non-discriminatory approach toward the issue of missiles in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security. They expressed their support for efforts to be continued within the UN to explore further the issue of missiles in all its aspects. In this regard, they emphasized the contribution of peaceful uses of space technologies, including space launch vehicle technologies, to human advancement, such as for telecommunications and data gathering on natural disasters. They also emphasized the need to keep the issue of missiles in all its aspects on the agenda of the UN General Assembly and welcomed that the Panel of Governmental Experts established in accordance with Resolution 59/67 successfully concluded its work in 2008. Pending the achievement of such a universal approach related to delivery systems for weapons of mass destruction, any initiative to address these concerns effectively and in a sustainable and comprehensive manner should be through an inclusive process of negotiations in a forum where all States could participate as equals. They stressed the importance of the security concerns of all States at regional and global levels in any approach to the issue of missiles in all its aspects. The Ministers believed that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZs) created by the treaties of Tlatelolco, Rarotonga, Bangkok, Pelindaba and Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free-status are positive steps and important measures towards strengthening global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. They welcomed the signing of the Treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia in Semipalatinsk on 8 September 2006 as an effective contribution to strengthening regional and global peace and security. They reiterated that in the context of nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZs), it is essential that NWS should provide unconditional assurances against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons to all States of the zone. They urged States to conclude agreements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned with a view to establishing new NWFZs in regions where they do not exist, in accordance with the provisions of the Final Document of the First Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament (SSOD-I) and the principles adopted by the 1999 UN Disarmament Commission. Recalling the convening and the outcome of the First Conference of the States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that Established Nuclear Weapon Free Zones held in Tlatelolco, Mexico, from 26 to 28 April 2005, the Ministers called on the States parties and signatories to the Treaties of NWFZs to implement further ways and means of co-operation among themselves, their treaty agencies and other interested States. They expressed their support for Mongolia's continued efforts in institutionalizing its nuclear-weapon-free status by working to conclude the required legal instrument in this regard with its two neighbours. The Ministers reiterated their support for the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction. As a priority step to this end, they reaffirmed the need for the speedy establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East in accordance with the Security Council Resolution 487 (1981) and paragraph 14 of the Security Council Resolution 687 (1991) and the relevant General Assembly resolutions adopted by consensus. They called upon all parties concerned to take urgent and practical steps towards the fulfilment of the proposal initiated by Iran in 1974 for the establishment of such a zone and, pending its establishment, they demanded on Israel, the only country in the region that has not joined the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) nor declared its intention to do so, to renounce possession of nuclear weapons, to accede to the NPT without delay, to place promptly all its nuclear facilities under IAEA full-scope safeguards according to Security Council Resolution 487 (1981) and to conduct its nuclear related activities in conformity with the non-proliferation regime. They called for the earliest implementation of relevant IAEA resolutions on "Application of IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East". They expressed great concern over the acquisition of nuclear capability by Israel which poses a serious and continuing threat to the security of neighbouring and other States, and condemned Israel for continuing to develop and stockpile nuclear arsenals. In this context they also condemned the statement made by the Prime Minister of Israel on 11 December 2006, related to the possession of nuclear weapons by Israel. They urged the continued consideration of the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities in the context of the IAEA, including at the General Conference at its 52nd Session. They were of the view that stability cannot be achieved in a region where massive imbalances in military capabilities are maintained particularly through the possession of nuclear weapons, which allow one party to threaten its neighbours, and the region. They further welcomed the initiative by H.E. Mr. Mohammed Hosni Mubarak, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, on the establishment of a zone free from weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, and in this context, they took into consideration the draft resolution tabled by the Syrian Arab Republic, on behalf of the Arab Group, before the Security Council on 29 December 2003 on the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. They stressed that necessary steps should be taken in different international fora for the establishment of this zone. They also called for the total and complete prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material and facilities, resources or devices and the extension of assistance in the nuclear related scientific or technological fields to Israel. In this regard, they expressed their serious concern over the continuing development whereby Israeli scientists are provided access to the nuclear facilities of one NWS. This development will have potentially serious negative implications on security in the region as well as the reliability of the global non-proliferation regime. The Ministers expressed their support for the efforts of the Arab Group in Vienna to keep the question of the Israeli Nuclear capabilities under considerations of the General Conference of the IAEA at its 52nd Session. The Ministers underscored the Movement's principled position concerning non-use or threat of use of force against the territorial integrity of any State. In this regard, they condemned the Israeli attack against a Syrian facility on September 6, 2007, which constitutes a flagrant violation of the UN Charter and welcomed Syria's cooperation with the IAEA in this regard. The Ministers emphasized the importance of the observance of environmental norms in the preparation and implementation of disarmament and arms limitation agreements. They reaffirmed that international disarmament forums should take fully into account the relevant environmental norms in negotiating treaties and agreements on disarmament and arms limitation and that all States, through their actions, should contribute fully to ensuring compliance with the aforementioned norms in the implementation of treaties and conventions to which they are parties. The Ministers emphasized the importance of the UN activities at the regional level to increase the stability and security of its Member States, which could be promoted in a substantive manner by the maintenance and revitalization of the three regional centres for peace and disarmament. The Ministers of the States Parties to the NPT, while reaffirming the package of agreements of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT and the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the NPT, reiterated their disappointment at the inability of the 2005 Review Conference of the NPT to agree on substantive recommendations. They reiterated their call for the firm commitment by all States parties to the Treaty to the implementation of all the provisions of the Treaty and called for the full implementation of the 13 practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to implement Article VI of the Treaty, particularly an unequivocal undertaking by the NWS to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament. Pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, they also recalled that the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the NPT reiterated that legally binding security assurances by the five NWS to the non-NWS parties to the Treaty strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime. They underlined the importance to establish subsidiary bodies to the relevant Main Committees of the 2010 Review Conference of the NPT to deliberate on practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons; to consider and recommend proposals on the implementation of the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the NPT; and to consider security assurances. In this regard, they emphasized the need for the Preparatory Committee meetings to continue to allocate specific time for deliberations on nuclear disarmament, implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and security assurances. They recalled the agreement that the Review Conference will be chaired by a representative from the Movement. The Ministers of the States Parties to the NPT called upon the NWS to implement their commitments not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-NWS parties to the Treaty or NWFZs at any time or under any circumstances, pending the conclusion of a legally binding instrument on security assurances. The Ministers reaffirmed the inalienable right of developing countries to engage in research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination. They continued to note with concern that undue restrictions on exports to developing countries of material, equipment and technology, for peaceful purposes persist. They again emphasized that proliferation concerns are best addressed through multilaterally negotiated, universal, comprehensive and nondiscriminatory agreements. Non-proliferation control arrangements should be transparent and open to participation by all States, and should ensure that they do not impose restrictions on access to material, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes required by developing countries for their continued development. The Ministers expressed their full confidence in the impartiality and professionalism of the IAEA and strongly rejected attempts by any State to politicize the work of the IAEA, including its technical co-operation programme, in violation of the IAEA Statute. The Ministers of the States Parties to the NPT emphasized once more that nothing in the Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I, II, and III of the Treaty. They stressed that this right constitutes one of the fundamental objectives of the Treaty. In this connection, they confirmed that each country's choices and decision in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be respected without jeopardizing its policies or international co-operation agreements and arrangements for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and its fuel-cycle policies. The Ministers stressed particularly the responsibility of developed countries to promote the legitimate need of nuclear energy of the developing countries, by allowing them to participate to the fullest extent possible in the transfer of nuclear equipment, materials, scientific and technological information for peaceful purposes with a view to achieving the largest benefits and applying pertinent elements of sustainable development in their activities. The Ministers emphasizing the importance of the positive role played by the Non-Aligned Members in the IAEA, stressed the necessity that all members of the IAEA strictly observe its Statute. They stressed that any undue pressure or interference in the Agency's activities, especially its verification process, which could jeopardize the efficiency and credibility of the Agency, should be avoided. They recognised that the IAEA is the sole competent authority for verification of compliance with the obligations under the respective safeguard agreements of the Member States. They also reaffirmed that a clear distinction has to be made between the legal obligations of Member States under their respective safeguards agreements and their voluntary undertakings, in order to ensure that such voluntary undertakings are not turned into legal safeguards obligations. The Ministers reaffirmed the inviolability of peaceful nuclear activities and that any attack or threat of attack against peaceful nuclear facilities - operational or under construction- poses a great danger to human beings and the environment, and constitutes a grave violation of international law, principles and purposes of the UN Charter and regulations of the IAEA. They recognised the need for a comprehensive multilaterally negotiated instrument prohibiting attacks or threat of attacks on nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Ministers affirmed the need to strengthen the Radiological Safety and Protection Systems at facilities utilising radioactive materials as well as at radioactive waste management facilities, including the safe transportation of these materials. They reaffirmed the need to strengthen existing international regulations relating to safety and security of transportation of such materials. While reiterating the need to take appropriate measures to prevent any dumping of nuclear or radioactive wastes, they called for effective implementation of the Code of Practice on the International Transboundary Movement of Radioactive Waste of the IAEA as a means of enhancing the protection of all States from the dumping of radioactive wastes on their territories. The Ministers stressed that the issue of proliferation should be resolved through political and diplomatic means, and that measures and initiatives taken in this regard should be within the framework of international law; relevant conventions; the UN Charter, and should contribute to the promotion of international peace, security and stability. The Ministers of the States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC) reaffirmed that the possibility of any use of bacteriological (biological) agents and toxins as weapons should be completely excluded, and the conviction that such use would be repugnant to the conscience of humankind. They recognised the particular importance of strengthening the Convention through multilateral negotiations for a legally binding Protocol and universal adherence to the Convention. They reiterated their call to promote international cooperation for peaceful purposes, including scientific-technical exchange. They underlined the importance to maintain close coordination among the NAM States Parties to the Convention and highlighted that the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons forms a whole and that, although it is possible to consider certain aspects separately, it is critical to deal with all of the issues interrelated to this Convention in a balanced and comprehensive manner. The Ministers of the States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) invited all States that have not yet signed or ratified the Convention to do so as soon as possible with a view to its universality. They reaffirmed that the effective contribution of the Convention to international and regional peace and security can be enhanced through its full implementation. The Ministers reaffirmed the importance of international cooperation in the field of chemical activities for purposes not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention. They reiterated their call on the developed countries to promote international cooperation for the benefit of States Parties through the transfer of technology, material and equipment for peaceful purposes in the chemical field and the removal of all and any discriminatory restrictions that are contrary to the letter and spirit of the Convention. They recalled that the full, balanced, effective and non-discriminatory implementation of all provisions of the Convention in particular economic and technical development through international cooperation, is fundamental to the achievement of its object and purpose. While expressing their serious concern that more than 60% of chemical weapons still remain to be destroyed, they called upon States having declared possession of chemical weapons to ensure full and complete compliance with the final extended deadline (29th of April 2012) for the destruction of their chemical weapons, in order to uphold the credibility and integrity of the Convention. They stressed that the obligation and responsibility of the destruction of chemical weapons lies solely with the possessor states Parties and that fulfillment of this obligation is fundamental to achieve the object and purpose of the Convention. In this regard, they called on the relevant possessor States Parties to intensify the rate of destruction of their chemical weapons stocks by taking every necessary measure to meet their final extended deadlines for the destruction of their chemical weapons in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. The Ministers of the States Parties to the CWC reaffirmed that the implementation of the Article X of the CWC on assistance and protection against chemical weapons make a significant contribution to countering the threats of use of chemical weapons. They stressed the importance of achieving and maintaining a high level of readiness of the OPCW to provide timely and needed assistance and protection against use or threat of use of chemical weapons, including assistance to the victims of chemical weapons. The Ministers of the States Parties to the CWC, while paying due respect to the chemical weapons victims and their families, declare their firm conviction that international support to provide special care and assistance to all victims suffering the effects of exposure to chemical weapons is an urgent humanitarian need and that the States Parties to the Convention as well as the OPCW should pay urgent attention to meeting these needs including through the possible establishment of an international support network. The Ministers regretted unsubstantiated allegations of non-compliance with relevant instruments on weapons of mass destruction and called on States Parties to such instruments that make such allegations to follow procedures set out in those instruments and to provide necessary substantiation for their allegations. They called upon all States parties to the respective international instruments to implement fully and in a transparent manner all their obligations under these instruments. The Ministers expressed their satisfaction with the consensus among States on measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. They welcomed the adoption by consensus of the General Assembly Resolution 62/33 entitled "Measures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction" and underlined the need for this threat to humanity to be addressed within the UN framework and through international co-operation. While stressing that the most effective way of preventing terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction is through the total elimination of such weapons, they emphasized that progress was urgently needed in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation in order to help maintain international peace and security and to contribute to global efforts against terrorism. They called upon all Member States to support international efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. They also urged all Member States to take and strengthen national measures, as appropriate, to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery and materials and technologies related to their manufacture. While noting the adoption of resolution 1540 (2004), resolution 1673 (2006) and resolution 1810 (2008) by the Security Council, the Ministers underlined the need to ensure that any action by the Security Council does not undermine the UN Charter and existing multilateral treaties on weapons of mass destruction and of international Organisations established in this regard, as well as the role of the General Assembly. They further cautioned against the continuing practice of the Security Council to utilize its authority to define the legislative requirements for Member States in implementing Security Council decisions. In this regard, the Ministers stressed the importance of the issue of non-state actors acquiring weapons of mass destruction to be addressed in an inclusive manner by the General Assembly, taking into account the views of all Member States. Mindful of the threat posed to humankind by the existing weapons of mass destruction and underlining the need for the total elimination of such weapons, the Ministers reaffirmed the need to prevent the emergence of new types of weapons of mass destruction and therefore supported the necessity of monitoring the situation and triggering international action as required. The Ministers reaffirmed the sovereign right of States to acquire, manufacture, export, import and retain conventional arms for their self-defence and security needs. They expressed their concern about unilateral coercive measures and emphasized that no undue restriction should be placed on the transfer of such arms. The Ministers recognised the significant imbalance in the production, possession and trade in conventional weapons between the industrialized and the Non-Aligned Countries, and called for a significant reduction in the production, possession and trade of conventional weapons by the industrialized states with a view to enhancing international and regional peace and security. The Ministers remained deeply concerned over the illicit transfer, manufacture and circulation of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world. They recognized the need to establish and maintain controls over private ownership of small arms. They called on all States, in particular major producing States, to ensure that the supply of small arms and light weapons is limited only to Governments or to entities duly authorized by Governments and to implement legal restrictions preventing the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons. They encouraged all initiatives by States to mobilize resources and expertise as well as to provide assistance to strengthen the full implementation of the UN Program of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in SALW in All Its Aspects. The Ministers emphasized the importance of early and full implementation of the Programme of Action, and in this regard, stressed that international assistance and cooperation is an essential aspect in the full implementation of the Programme of Action. They expressed disappointment at the inability of the UN Conference to Review the Progress made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in SALW in All its Aspects, held in New York, from 26 June to 7 July 2006, to agree on a final Document. The Ministers noted the third Biannual Meeting of the States (BMS) held in New York, from 14 to 18 July 2008, which considered the national, regional and global implementation of the Programme of Action. They reaffirmed the total validity of the Programme of Action and encouraged the NAM delegations to coordinate efforts in the UN with a view to reaching agreement on a follow-up to the Programme of Action in order to ensure its full implementation. They called for the full implementation of the international instrument to enable States to identify and trace in a timely and reliable manner the illicit small arms and light weapons, which was adopted by the General Assembly. The Ministers continued to deplore the use, in contravention of international humanitarian law of anti-personnel mines in conflict situations aimed at maiming, killing and terrorising innocent civilians, denying them access to farmland, causing famine and forcing them to flee their homes eventually leading to de-population and preventing the return of civilians to their place of original residence. They called upon all States in the position to do so, to provide the necessary financial, technical and humanitarian assistance to landmine clearance operations, the social and economic rehabilitation of victims as well as to ensure full access of affected countries to material equipment, technology and financial resources for mine clearance. The Ministers of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction invited those States that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the Convention. The Ministers expressed concern about the explosive remnants of the Second World War, particularly in the form of landmines which continue to cause human and material damage and obstruct development plans in some Non-Aligned Countries. They called on the States primarily responsible for laying these mines and leaving explosives outside their territories during Second World War to cooperate with the affected countries and provide mine action support to affected countries, including information exchange, maps indicating the locations of mines and explosives, technical assistance for mine clearance, defrayal of the costs of clearance and compensation for any losses caused by mines-laid. The Ministers of States Parties to the Convention on Prohibition or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects (CCW) and its Protocols encouraged States to become parties to the Convention and its additional Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War. The Ministers recognized the adverse humanitarian impact caused by the use of cluster munitions. They stressed the Movement's principled position on the central role of the United Nations in the area of disarmament and arms control. They took note of the continued consideration of the issue of cluster munitions in the context of the CCW. They also took note of the Diplomatic Conference on Cluster Munitions, held in Dublin, 19-30 May 2008. The Ministers underlined the importance of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 62/30, taking into consideration the possible harmful effects to human health and the environment, caused by the use of weapons and munitions containing depleted uranium. The Ministers stressed the importance of the symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development and the important role of security in this connection, and expressed concern at the increasing global military expenditure, which could otherwise be spent on development needs. They further stressed the importance of the reduction of military expenditures, in accordance with the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments, and urged all States to devote resources made available from there to economic and social development, in particular in the fight against poverty. They expressed firm support for unilateral, bilateral, regional and multilateral measures adopted by some governments aimed at reducing military expenditures, thereby contributing to strengthening regional and international peace and security and recognised that confidence building measures assisted in this regard. The Ministers commended the continued work of the NAM Working Group on Disarmament, under the chairmanship of Indonesia, in coordinating issues of common concern to the Movement in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. They encouraged all NAM delegations to actively participate at the international disarmament meetings with a view to promote and achieve the objectives of the Movement. Consistent with and guided by the aforementioned principled positions and affirming the need to promote, defend and preserve these positions, the Ministers agreed to: 151.1 Continue to pursue the positions and priorities of the Movement, as appropriate, in the relevant international fora; 151.2 Task the NAM Coordinating Bureau to undertake efforts, as appropriate, with a view to achieving the objectives of the Movement at disarmament and international security meetings. Terrorism The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled position concerning terrorism, as follows: 152.1 Terrorist acts constitute the most flagrant violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, in particular the right to life, leading to the lack of the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedom of peoples, and that such acts endanger the territorial integrity and stability of States as well as national, regional and international security, de-stabilise legitimately constituted governments or the prevailing constitutional order and political unity of States, affect the stability of nations and the very basis of societies, as well as create adverse consequences on the economic and social development and cause the destruction of the physical and economic infrastructure of States; 152.2 Terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilisation or ethnic group, and that these attributions should not be used to justify terrorism or counter-terrorism measures that include, inter alia, profiling of terrorists and intrusion on individual privacy; 152.3 Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for whatever purposes, wherever, by whomever, against whomsoever committed are, in any circumstance, unjustifiable, whatever the considerations or factors that may be invoked to justify them; 152.4 Terrorism should not be equated with the legitimate struggle of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation for self-determination and national liberation. The brutalisation of people remaining under foreign occupation should continue to be denounced as the gravest form of terrorism, and that the use of State power for the suppression and violence against peoples struggling against foreign occupation in exercising their inalienable right to self-determination should continue to be condemned. In this regard and in accordance with the UN Charter, international law and the relevant UN resolutions, the struggle of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation for self-determination and national liberation does not constitute terrorism; 152.5 The Movement reaffirmed its principled position under international law and in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46/51 of 27 January 1992 as well as other relevant UN resolutions on the legitimacy of the struggle of people under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation for national liberation and self-determination, which does not constitute terrorism, and once again called for the definition of terrorism to differentiate it from the legitimate struggle of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation for self determination and national liberation. Acknowledging the serious danger and threats posed by terrorism and terrorist acts to the international community, consistent with and guided by the Movement's principled positions thereof as well as affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures: 153.1 Strongly and unequivocally condemn, as criminal, and reject terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, as well as all acts, methods and practices of terrorism wherever, by whomever, against whomsoever committed, including those in which States are directly or indirectly involved, which are unjustifiable whatever the considerations or factors that may be invoked to justify them, and in this context, reaffirm their support for the provisions contained in General Assembly resolution 46/51 of 27 January 1992 and other relevant UN resolutions; 153.2 Resolve to take speedy and effective measures to eliminate international terrorism, and in this context, urge all States, consistent with the UN Charter, to fulfil their obligations under international law and international humanitarian law combating terrorism, including by prosecuting or, where appropriate, extraditing the perpetrators of terrorist acts; by preventing the organisation, instigation or financing of terrorist acts against other States from within or outside their territories or by organisations based in their territories; by refraining from organising, instigating, assisting, financing or participating in terrorist acts in the territories of other States; by refraining from encouraging activities within their territories directed towards the commission of such acts; by refraining from allowing the use of their territories for planning, training or financing for such acts; or by refraining from supplying arms or other weapons that could be used for terrorist acts in other States; 153.3 Condemn any form of, and refrain from extending, political, diplomatic, moral or material support for terrorism, and in this context, urge all States, consistent with the UN Charter and in fulfilling their obligations under international law, to ensure that refugee status or any other legal status is not abused by the perpetrators, organisers or facilitators of terrorist acts and that claims of political motivation by them are not recognised as grounds for refusing requests for their extradition; 153.4 Urge all States, which have not yet done so, to consider to ratify or accede to the thirteen international and UN conventions and protocols relating to combating terrorism; 153.5 Observe and implement the provisions of all international conventions as well as regional and bilateral instruments relating to terrorism to which their countries are party, taking into account the recommendations of the Final Document of the UN Conference on the Prevention of Crime and Criminal Justice held in Cairo, Egypt in 1995 and the International Conference on Combating Terrorism held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 2005; 153.6 Oppose attempts to equate the legitimate struggle of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation for self-determination and national liberation with terrorism, in order to prolong occupation and oppression of innocent people with impunity; 153.7 Further call on all States to endorse in principle the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the UN to define terrorism, to differentiate it from the struggle for national liberation and to reach comprehensive and effective measures for concerted action. They also denounced the brutalisation of peoples kept under foreign occupation as the gravest form of terrorism. They condemned the use of State power for the suppression and violence against innocent victims struggling against foreign occupation to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination. They stressed the sanctity of this right and urged that in this era of enlarged freedom and democracy, people under foreign occupation should be allowed to freely determine their destiny. In this context, they also reaffirmed their support for General Assembly Resolution 46/51 of 27 January 1992 as well as other relevant UN resolutions and the principled position of the Movement that the struggle of peoples under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation for self-determination does not constitute terrorism; 153.8 Call upon all states to respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, and to reaffirm their commitment in this respect to prevent human rights violations in consistency with the rule of law and their obligation under international law, in particular international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, and in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions. 153.9 While reaffirming the Movement's principled position on combating international terrorism, and in the light of the previous initiatives and considerations adopted by NAM, and of their conviction that multilateral cooperation under the UN auspices is the most effective means to combat international terrorism, the Ministers reiterated their call for an International Summit Conference under the auspices of the UN to formulate a joint organised response of the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations including identifying its root causes; 153.10 Further reiterate the importance of the conclusion of a Comprehensive Convention for Combating International Terrorism and, in this respect, noting the negotiations in the Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism established by General Assembly Resolution 51/210, for elaboration of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism and the continuing efforts to that end, and call upon all States to co-operate in resolving the outstanding issues. 153.11 The Ministers call for a transparent and comprehensive implementation of the United Nations Global Counter Terrorism Strategy and further call for discussing, inter alia, the mandate of the Task Force, and defining its relations with Member States, in particular the activities of the working groups. In this regard they agreed to actively engage in the review of the implementation of the UN Global Counter Terrorism Strategy in a manner that would advance the principled position of the Movement. 153.12 Support the initiative launched by Tunisia in order to elaborate by consensus an International Code of Conduct within the framework of the UN aimed at reinforcing coordination and multilateral efforts for the prevention of terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed, in conformity with international law and the UN Charter, pending the conclusion of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism; 153.13 Hold a NAM Ministerial Meeting on the issue of terrorism at the most appropriate date, based on the progress of the discussions and negotiations on this issue at the United Nations; 153.14 Support national, regional and international efforts and arrangements that seek to implement, where appropriate, the pertinent international legally binding instruments, as well as the relevant UN resolutions, including General Assembly resolution 46/51 and Security Council resolution 1373, and regional arrangements and instruments relating to combating terrorism; strengthen the cooperation with all States in this regard, emphasizing that such cooperation should be in conformity with the UN Charter, international law and the relevant international conventions; and in this context, urge the relevant UN organs to promote ways and means to support and strengthen such cooperation; 153.15 Reject actions and measures, the use or threat of use of force in particular by armed forces, which violate the UN Charter and international law especially the relevant international conventions, imposed or threatened to be imposed by any State against any Non-Aligned Country under the pretext of combating terrorism or to pursue its political aims, including by directly or indirectly categorising them as terrorism sponsoring-States. They called upon the Security Council sanction committees to streamline their listing and delisting procedures to address the concerns of due process and transparency. They further totally reject the use of the term "axis of evil" by a certain State to target other States under the pretext of combating terrorism, as well as the unilateral preparation of lists accusing States of allegedly supporting terrorism, which are inconsistent with international law and constitute on their part a form of psychological and political terrorism and in this context, underscoring the need to exercise solidarity with the Non-Aligned Countries that are affected by such actions and measures; and 153.16 Introduce comprehensive qualitative changes to national laws and legislations of NonAligned Countries, in order to criminalise all terrorist acts as well as support, financing or instigation of such acts. 153.17 Reaffirm their support to the proposal of The Custodian of The Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud to establish the International Centre to combat terrorism adopted by the International Conference to combat terrorism held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in February 2005. The Riyadh Conference asserted that elimination of terrorism is only possible through a coordinated international efforts and cooperation. The Conference called upon the United Nations to establish the centre to exchange information and share expertise, and coordinate efforts to monitor the activities of terrorist organization and individuals closely. Democracy The Ministers reiterated that democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives. They reaffirmed that while all democracies share common features, there is no single model of democracy, that it does not belong to any country or region, and further reaffirmed the necessity of due respect for sovereignty and the right to self-determination. They expressed their conviction that international co-operation for the promotion of democracy, on the basis of respect for the principles enshrined in the UN Charter as well as those of transparency, impartiality, non-selectivity and inclusiveness, could contribute to the attainment of the goal of democracy consolidation at national and international levels. The Ministers reaffirmed that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The international community should support the strengthening and promotion of democracy, development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms in the entire world, in compliance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The Ministers recalled the pledge by the leaders of UN Member States, as reaffirmed in the 2005 World Summit Outcome, and noted the important role of the UN in the promotion and strengthening of democratic practices in Member States which have sought legal, technical and financial assistance. The Ministers took note of the operationalization of the UN Democracy Fund. The Ministers welcomed the successful organization of the Sixth International Conference on New or Restored Democracies held in Doha, Qatar from 30 October to 1 November 2006 and appreciated the active participation in this Conference. 158.1 Work collectively for the promotion of democracy and for more inclusive political processes allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all countries, including seeking assistance from the UN on a voluntary basis; 158.2 Promote, while recognizing the importance of the promotion of democracy at the national level, the democratisation of the system of international governance in order to increase the participation of developing countries in international decision-making; and 158.3 Oppose and condemn any politically motivated attempt or misuse of the international co-operation for the promotion of democracy, including the marginalisation or exclusion of Non-Aligned Countries from the full participation and equal opportunities of membership in the intergovernmental bodies of the UN system. North-South Dialogue and Cooperation In acknowledging the need for an increased interaction between the leaders of developing and developed world, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures, among others: 159.1 Generate, expand and deepen a more dynamic relationship and co-operation with developed and industrialised countries, in particular with the Group of Eight, firmly rooted on mutual respect, mutuality of benefits, shared and differentiated responsibilities, constructive engagement and dialogue, broad partnership and genuine interdependence, with the aim of forging compatible or complementary responses or initiatives on global issues and generate greater understanding between the North and the South; 159.2 Continue to hold Ministerial Meetings between the Troikas of NAM and the European Union, within the framework of ordinary sessions of the General Assembly, aimed at facilitating comprehensive and transparent exchange of views of common interest to be addressed in the UNGA sessions. 159.3 Taking note of the successful Ministerial meetings held by the Chair of the NAM with others interested parties, to continue to hold meetings, including at the Ministerial level, between the Chair of NAM and other interested parties, as appropriate, on issues of common interest. 159.4 Ensure that the views of developing countries are fully taken into account before decisions on relevant issues affecting them and the international community are made by developed countries, which could be achieved through, inter alia, institutionalising established contacts between the leaders at the highest level of developing and developed countries, and in this context, request the Chair of the Movement to coordinate with the Chair of the Group of 77 and China to identify measures that could contribute towards achieving this objective; and 159.5 Call on forthcoming annual Summits of the Group of Eight to take into account the interests and concerns of developing countries, and request the Chair of the Movement to convey those interests and concerns to the leaders of the Group of Eight. Role of Regional Organisations The Ministers underscored the important role that regional arrangements and agencies, composed of Non-Aligned and other developing countries, can play in the promotion of regional peace and security as well as economic and social development through cooperation among countries in the region. The Ministers called for the intensification of the process of consultations, cooperation, and coordination between the UN and regional and sub-regional organisations, arrangements, or agencies, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the UN Charter, as well as on their mandate, scope and composition, which is useful and can contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. The Ministers recalled the UN Declaration on the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and called on the international community to renew commitment for NEPAD and other related initiatives for Africa, noting in this regard the efforts exerted by the African Union and other regional economic communities in the area of economic integration, as well as ongoing efforts by the African Union in the operationalisation of the provision contained in General Assembly resolution 59/213 highlighting the particular areas of required support by the UN system to the African Union, in the social, economic, political, peace and security areas, and express their full commitment to continue to advocate the necessity for continued international support required to meet the special needs of Africa as contained in the Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Outcome Summit. CHAPTER II: REGIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL POLITICAL ISSUES Middle East Peace Process The Ministers reaffirmed their support for the Middle East peace process based on Security Council resolutions 242, 338, 425, 1397 and 1515, the Madrid terms of reference and the principle of land for peace. They rejected attempts to alter the terms of reference of the peace process and further rejected the imposition of unilateral measures and schemes by Israel, the occupying Power, aimed at forcibly and illegally imposing a unilateral solution. In this regard, they stressed the need for intensified and coordinated efforts by the international community to support the peace process as well as to ensure respect for international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law, the key to a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Arab-Israeli conflict as a whole. The Ministers stressed the need for the advancement and resumption of substantial negotiations between the parties on all tracks of the peace process for the achievement of a comprehensive, just, lasting and peaceful settlement, based on the relevant U.N. resolutions and in accordance with the rules and principles of international law enshrined therein. In this regard, they reiterated the necessity and urgency of ending the prolonged and unlawful Israeli occupation of all of the Arab territories occupied since 1967. They further reaffirmed their long-standing position in support of the establishment of the independent State of Palestine in all of the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967, including East Jerusalem as its capital. The Ministers took note of the international conferences held at Annapolis in November 2007 and at Paris in December 2007 and called for serious follow-up and further intense efforts by the international community for the genuine resumption and advancement of the peace process on all tracks towards attainment of a just and comprehensive peace and regional stability. They specifically stressed in the role and responsibilities undertaken by the members of the Quartet and called upon the Quartet to exert serious efforts and actions to support and promote the negotiations between the parties on final status issues, including serious and sincere implementation of the Road Map for a permanent two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They also called upon the Security Council to engage the Quartet, considering the Council's Charter authority and responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and called on the members of the NAM Caucus of the Council to remain active in this regard. The Ministers also reaffirmed their support for the Arab Peace Initiative, which was adopted by the XIV Arab Summit in Beirut in March 2002, and reaffirmed by the 19th Arab summit in Riyadh in March 2007, and welcomed the XX Arab Summit in Damascus in March 2008, which reaffirmed the commitment by all Arab States to the Arab Peace Initiative and stressed that such commitment is subject to adherence by Israel to its obligations under the terms of reference for achieving peace in the region, and called for intensification of efforts in this regard. They urged the Security Council to act upon the Initiative, and on the basis of its own resolutions, towards achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East, particularly in light of the recent deterioration of the situation and the current urgent circumstances in the region. Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem The Ministers reaffirmed their adherence to the positions concerning Palestine adopted by the XIV Summit of Heads of State or Government held in Havana in September 2006, as well as by the XIV Ministerial Conference of NAM, held in Durban in August 2004, and by the NAM at the Ministerial Meeting in Putrajaya in May 2006, which constitute the guidelines for the Non-Aligned Countries on the question of Palestine. In this regard, they further reaffirmed their adherence to the principled positions set forth in the Declaration on Palestine adopted by the Committee on Palestine during the XIV Summit in September 2006 and by the Ministerial Meeting of the NAM Coordinating Bureau in New York in September 2007. The Ministers expressed their deep regret that sixty years have passed since the 1948 AlNakba that befell the Palestinian people, by which they became a stateless and dispossessed people, displaced and dispersed from their homeland of Palestine, and that more than half of the Palestinian people continue to live in exile in refugee camps throughout the region and in the Diaspora. The Ministers also expressed their deep regret that since 1967, for forty-one years now, the Palestinian people have continuously suffered under the brutal Israeli military occupation of their land and continue to be denied their fundamental human rights, including the right to self-determination and the right of the Palestine refugees to return. The Ministers reiterated their regret at the lack of progress made, despite renewed international efforts and a resumption of the peace process, to address the major issues and follow-up core positions regarding the question of Palestine. They also expressed their grave concern in particular about the serious deterioration of the situation and critical political, economic, social and humanitarian conditions in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, as a result of ongoing unlawful policies and practices by Israel, the occupying Power. They condemned the continuing brutal Israeli military campaign against the Palestinian people, particularly in the Gaza Strip, by which the occupying Power has continued to commit grave human rights violations and reported war crimes, including the killing and injuring of Palestinian civilians, including children, by use of excessive and indiscriminate force and extrajudicial executions, and the vast destruction of properties, infrastructure and agricultural lands. They condemned also Israel's detention and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians, including hundreds of women and children and numerous elected officials, and called for their immediate release. They reiterated the demanded that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately cease all such violations of international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law. The Ministers also condemned Israel's continued imposition of collective punishment upon the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They condemned in particular Israel's inhumane closure and blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in the virtual imprisonment of the entire Palestinian civilian population there and the deepening of the economic, social and humanitarian deprivation and crisis due to the occupying Power's obstruction of access to food, medicines, fuel and electricity, building materials and other basic human necessities as well as the obstruction of movement of humanitarian personnel and sick persons requiring medical treatment outside of Gaza. The Ministers stressed that, in addition to violating countless provisions of human rights law, such collective punishment measures by Israel are tantamount to grave breaches of international humanitarian law, by which it is bound as the occupying Power and with which it must scrupulously comply. They called upon Israel to cease such illegal practices against the Palestinian people and to immediately and permanently end its illegal closure of the Gaza Strip and to allow for the opening of all of the Gaza Strip's border crossings for the movement of persons and goods into and out of the Territory. In this regard, they reiterated their support for the Palestinian Authority's proposal to assume responsibility for the operation of the Palestinian side of the Gaza Strip's border crossings, and called upon the parties to resume the application of internationally-agreed arrangements to ensure their speedy reopening and to ease the isolation and suffering of the civilian population. The Ministers also condemned Israel's imposition of severe restrictions on the movement of persons and goods via closures, hundreds of checkpoints and the Wall and its associated permit regime. They expressed alarm that such unlawful Israeli practices are destroying the Palestinian economy and society, are physically severing the northern, central and southern parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory into separate areas and isolating East Jerusalem, and are gravely undermining the Territory's contiguity, integrity and unity. In this connection, they reiterated their strong condemnation of Israel's continuing intensive campaign of settler colonialism, including vast land confiscations and the construction and expansion of illegal settlements, especially in and around Occupied East Jerusalem, as well as its attempts to illegally annex the Jordan Valley. They reaffirmed all relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, including those relating to Jerusalem and confirming that it is an integral part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory; demanded their implementation; and considered that all Israeli measures aimed at altering the legal, geographic and demographic character and status of Jerusalem and of the Occupied Palestinian Territory as a whole are null and void. They reiterated the illegality and dangers of such Israeli unilateral measures in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and reaffirmed that these unlawful measures cannot alter the terms of reference of the peace process nor negate the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. Further in this connection, the Ministers reiterated their condemnation of Israel's continuing construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, in flagrant defiance of international law, the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July 2004 and General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004. They expressed their deep concern at the physical, economic and social devastation being caused by the Wall, which is also dissecting the Territory into several walled, and isolated cantons and further isolating Occupied East They warned that, if completed, the Wall, along with Israel's illegal settlements and its fortification of illegal checkpoints, will destroy the contiguity, integrity and unity of the Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, and will thus render the two-State solution physically impossible to achieve. They thus stressed the urgency and necessity of respect for and compliance with obligations under international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as with the Advisory Opinion and resolution ES-10/15 by Israel, the occupying power, by Member States and by the UN. They welcomed the establishment of the "United Nations Register of Damage caused by the Construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" and called for its expeditious operation and the speedy fulfilment of its mandate. The Ministers reaffirmed their support for the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and the Palestinian Authority under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas and emphasized the importance of maintaining and protecting the national and democratic institutions of the Palestinian Authority, including the Palestinian legislative council which shall constitute a vital foundation for the future independent Palestinian State. The Ministers also called for the speedy restoration of the situation in the Gaza Strip to that which existed prior to the events of June 2007 to pave the way for Palestinian dialogue to achieve national reconciliation and unity, and, in this regard, expressed support for the Yemeni Initiative and called for its implementation. The Ministers called for intensification of efforts by the Quartet and the entire international community, in particular the Security Council, to address the current political and humanitarian crisis, in order to ameliorate the situation on the ground and to help advance peace process negotiations between the two sides towards ending the occupation of the Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, that began in 1967, and thus realising the establishment of the sovereign, independent, and viable state of Palestine and the promotion of peace and security. They called upon the Security Council to actively engage the, Quartet, considering the Council's Charter authority for the maintenance of international peace and security. They stressed the continuing importance of the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet Road Map and called for its full and honest implementation. The Ministers reaffirmed the necessity of upholding international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter with regard to the question of Palestine under all circumstances. They also reaffirmed the permanent responsibility of the UN towards the question of Palestine until it is resolved in all its aspects on the basis of international law, including a just resolution to the plight of the refugees in accordance with General Assembly Resolution 194 (III). They once more called upon the UN not to reward illegal actions and intransigence and to increase its efforts towards the attainment of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace settlement, based on the two-State solution, and the realization of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people. In this context, the Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to the right of the Palestinian people to exercise self-determination and sovereignty in their independent State of Palestine, on the basis of the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures: 176.1 Continue holding meetings at ministerial level of the NAM Committee on Palestine, within the framework of the Coordinating Bureau Ministerial Meetings that take place at the outset of UNGA ordinary sessions, as well as during any other Ministerial Meetings of the Movement, whenever necessary and in accordance with the developments on this issue. 176.2 Maintain regular contacts and dialogue at ministerial level between NAM Ministerial Delegation on Palestine and the members of the Quartet and the Members of the UN Security Council, with a view to enhancing the role played by NAM in the international efforts seeking a solution to the question of Palestine and lasting peace in the region. 176.3 Continue to actively participate in UN Security Council, including via a revitalized role of the NAM Caucus of the Council, and General Assembly meetings addressing the question of Palestine. 176.4 Convene a parallel forum of civil society in 2008, preferably within UN premises, intended to mobilize international public opinion on this issue and thus make a substantial contribution to attaining a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Occupied Syrian Golan The Ministers reaffirmed that all measures and actions taken, or to be taken by Israel, the occupying Power, such as its illegal decision of 14 December 1981 that purports to alter the legal, physical and demographic status of the occupied Syrian Golan and its institutional structure, as well as the Israeli measures to apply its jurisdiction and administration there, are null and void and have no legal effect. They further reaffirmed that all such measures and actions, including the illegality of Israeli settlement construction and expansion activities in the Occupied Syrian Golan since 1967, constitute a flagrant violation of international law, international conventions, the Charter and decisions of the UN, particularly Security Council Resolution 497 (1981), the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 on the Protection of Civilians in Time of War, and the defiance of will of the international community. They reiterated the Movement's demand that Israel comply with Security Council Resolution 497 (1981) and withdraw fully from the occupied Syrian Golan to the lines of 4 June 1967, in implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and that Israel adheres to the Madrid terms of reference based on the principle of land for peace, which are in their entirety considered to be a primary and basic element in the negotiation process that should be adhered to, including the immediate commencement of the demarcation of the 4 June 1967 line. The Ministers reaffirmed the Movement's unwavering support and solidarity with the Syrian just demand and rights to restore the full Syrian sovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan on the basis of the terms of reference of the Arab Peace Initiative, the Madrid Peace Process, as well as the principle of land for peace and in accordance with relevant Security Council Resolutions. They again demanded that Israel respects all its commitments and pledges. The Ministers reiterated their demand for Israel to comply immediately and unconditionally with the provisions of the Forth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Times of War, dated 12 August 1949, and to apply them to the Syrian detainees in the occupied Syrian Golan.

The Ministers called upon Israel, the occupying power, to reopen the Quneitra entry point, to facilitate the visits of the Syrian citizens under Israeli occupation to their motherland, Syria. Lebanon, the Remaining Occupied Lebanese Lands, and the Consequences of the Israeli Aggression against Lebanon The Ministers congratulated the people and leaders of Lebanon and welcomed and strongly supported the agreement reached in Doha on May 21 under the auspices of His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of Qatar, pursuant to the efforts of the Ministerial Committee of the Arab League, chaired by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabor Al-Thani, and the Secretary General of the Arab League, Amr Musa, which constituted an essential step towards the resolution of the current crisis, the return to the normal functioning of Lebanese democratic institutions, and the complete restoration of Lebanon's unity and stability. The Ministers welcomed the election of the new President of the Republic, and supported the agreement to establish a national unity cabinet and to address Lebanon's electoral law, in accordance with the Arab League Initiative.

The Ministers were strongly convinced that there should be no impunity for violations of international law and international humanitarian law and human rights, and that Israel should be held accountable for its apparent commission of large scale crimes. Furthermore Israel should, without further delay, surrender all the maps and information on the exact locations of the land mines and cluster munitions it had planted in Lebanon to the United Nations as these mines and cluster munitions are causing lots of death and terror among both the civilian population and the Lebanese Army. The Ministers called for a strict implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006), and in this respect called for an immediate and complete cease fire, and for the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon with full respect for the Blue Line and the sovereignty of Lebanon in land, sea, and air and welcomes the recent exchange of detainees and prisoners through the efforts of the UN Secretary General.

Libyan Arab Jamahiriya The Ministers recalled previous positions of the Movement and reiterated their deep regret for the conviction of Libyan citizen Abdulbasit El-Magrahi, and demanded the immediate release of the said citizen, in view of the fact that his conviction was politically motivated, without any valid legal grounds, as confirmed by the UN Observers, and large numbers of international legal experts.

The ministers condemned all acts of piracy and armed robbery against vessels in the territorial waters of Somalia and the seas off the coast of Somalia which hampered humanitarian aid to Somalia and pose a threat to commercial maritime and international navigation in the region. In this context, they welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 1816 (2008) and stressed that this resolution should be implemented in a manner fully consistent with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Ministers expressed support for Secretary General's integrated approach for peace and stability in Somalia, including for his recommendation to relocate the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS) and the country team headquarters to Somalia.

The Ministers noted with satisfaction the sustained efforts being made by the Government of The Sudan, the African Union, the League of Arab States and the United Nations to reactivate the political process leading to a lasting peace in Darfur. They expressed their conviction that no action should be taken that could jeopardize the delicate nature of the process underway in The Sudan. In that context, the Ministers expressed deep concern over the recent application by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), against the Honourable President of The Sudan, and considered that this action could seriously undermine the ongoing efforts aimed at facilitating the early resolution of the conflict in Darfur and the promotion of long-lasting peace and reconciliation in The Sudan and could be conducive to greater destabilization with far reaching consequences for the country and the region. Therefore, they decided to support steps in the United Nations and elsewhere aimed at defusing this new and dangerous situation and preventing its recurrence.

Likewise, they reaffirmed the Movement's commitment to work towards the full implementation of the decisions and recommendations contained in those documents, and called on the international community, including international financial institutions as well as regional development banks, to support efforts of developing countries, toward that end. The Ministers emphasized that economic and social development should remain the centrepiece of the deliberations at the UN, and that the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the MDGs, should continue to be the over-arching framework of the UN. They further emphasized the need for strengthened enhanced global partnership for development based on the recognition of national leadership and ownership of development strategies for the full implementation of the outcomes of the major UN conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields. They also stressed the need to strengthen the existing mechanisms and establish where needed, effective mechanisms to review and follow-up the implementation of the outcomes of all the major UN conferences and summits in the social, economic and related fields. The Ministers expressed their deep concerns over the recent global food crisis. They underlined that the global food crisis is caused by multiple interlinked factors and that its consequences are equally multidimensional, which exacerbate the challenges to achieving the IADGs including the MDGs and escalate poverty, hunger and malnutrition, in developing countries. In this context, the Ministers stressed that solutions need a multi-faceted approach requiring short, medium, and long-term actions. The Ministers underscored the need for the international community, in particular developed countries, to assist developing countries efforts to fully implement all internationally agreed development goals, including the MDGs, in particular their ongoing efforts to halve the number of people living in poverty and hunger by 2015. They further called on the international community to continue supporting developing countries efforts aimed at integrating the principles of sustainable development into their national development strategies and reversing the loss of environmental resources, including through the fulfilment of the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Ministers stressed that each country has the sovereign right to determine its own development priorities and strategies, and called upon the international community to categorically reject any conditionality in the provision of development assistance. The Ministers insisted on the need for undertaking concrete actions and measures at all levels for the full implementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Programme of Implementation, based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set out in Principle 7 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. They further called for the early and full implementation of the Bali Strategic Plan for Capacity Building and Technology Support for the developing countries. The Ministers recognized that climate change poses serious risks and challenges in particular to developing countries, and called for urgent global action to address climate change in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. They reaffirmed that efforts to address climate change should promote the integration of all three components of sustainable development that is economic development, social development and environmental protection, as interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars, in an integrated, coordinated and balanced manner. The Ministers welcomed the decisions adopted during the 13th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC held in Bali, including those on the "Bali Action Plan", the "Adaptation Fund", the "Development and Transfer of Technology" and on the "Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate". The Ministers urged the international community to assist developing countries to address the consequences of climate change, particularly through new, additional and predictable financial resources, capacity building, and access to and transfer of technology. The Ministers recognised that the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalising world and the emergence of rule-based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy, i.e. the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, investment, and industrial development, is now often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations. It is for each government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space, and emphasized that it is particularly important for developing countries, bearing in mind development goals and objectives, that all countries take into account the need for appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and commitments. The Ministers expressed the need to encourage greater direct investment, including foreign investment, to developing countries and countries with economies in transition to support their development activities, in line with their national priorities. The Ministers welcomed the offer and the efforts of the State of Qatar to host the first follow-up Conference to review the implementation of the outcome of the international conference on financing for development, to be held in Doha from 29 November to 2 December 2008, and urged the international community, in particular the developed countries to make all necessary efforts to contribute for providing a decisive impetus to financing for development with a view to achieving all internationally-agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Noting the interdependence of nations and the varying levels of Human development world-wide, the Ministers reaffirmed the need for a New Global Human Order aimed at reversing growing disparities between rich and poor, both among and within countries, through the promotion of poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work, and social integration. In this context, they welcomed the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 62/213 on the role of the United Nations in promoting a new Global Human Order and in particular the request contained therein for a report by the Secretary General assessing the implications of growing inequality for development. The Ministers called on the international community to implement its commitment to address the special needs of Africa, which is the only continent not on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and its resolve to strengthen cooperation with the New Partnership for Africa's Development by providing coherent support for the programmes drawn up by African leaders within that framework, including by mobilizing internal and external financial resources and facilitating approval of such programmes by the multilateral financial institutions; to support the African commitment to ensure that by 2015 all children have access to complete, free and compulsory primary education of good quality, as well as to basic health care; to support the building of an international infrastructure consortium involving the African Union, the World Bank and the African Development Bank, with the New Partnership for Africa's Development as the main framework, to facilitate public and private infrastructure investment in Africa; The Ministers further called for a comprehensive and durable solution to the external debt problems of African countries, including, inter alia, cancellation or restructuring for heavily indebted African countries not part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative that have unsustainable debt burdens; to make efforts to fully integrate African countries in the international trading system, including through targeted trade capacity-building programmes; to support the efforts of commodity-dependent African countries to restructure, diversify and strengthen the competitiveness of their commodity sectors and decide to work towards market-based arrangements with the participation of the private sector for commodity price-risk management; to supplement the efforts of African countries, individually and collectively, to increase agricultural productivity, in a sustainable way, as set out in the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Plan of the New Partnership for Africa's Development as part of an African "Green Revolution"; The Ministers welcomed the convening of the first High Level Meeting on Africa's Development Needs scheduled for 22 September 2008 which will constitute a significant event that will review the implementation of all commitments made to Africa in order to comprehensively address the special development needs of the continent, in this regard the Ministers called for a real commitment at the highest political level for the full implementation of all commitments made to Africa by the international community in all the major summits and conferences which must be implemented as a matter of urgency if we are to succeed in to lifting millions of African out of dehumanising poverty and hunger and creating a better life for all. Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States The Ministers recalled the special needs of the least developed countries (LDCs), the small island developing states (SIDS), and the landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) within a new global framework for transit transport cooperation for landlocked and transit developing countries, and reaffirmed the need for continued support and assistance for their endeavours, particularly in their efforts to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and the Brussels Programme of Action for the LDCs for the Decade 2001-2010, the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of SIDS, and the Almaty Programme of Action. The Ministers also recalled the results of the first Summit Meeting of LLDCs on 14 September 2006 in Havana and emphasized the need for greater cooperation of the international community towards the full implementation of the declaration of the Ministers of Land-locked Developing Countries. The Ministers welcomed the Ulaanbaatar Declaration adopted at the Meeting of Trade Ministers of landlocked developing countries, held in Ulaanbaatar on 28 and 29 August 2007, the outcome documents of the thematic meeting on transit transport infrastructure development, held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, from 18-20 June 2007, and the thematic meeting on international trade and trade facilitation, held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, on 30-31 August 2007 and the adoption of the UNGA resolution 62/204 and the communiqué of ministerial meeting of Landlocked developing countries in New York, on 28 September 2007. The Ministers stressed the importance of the upcoming mid-term review of the Almaty Program of Action to be held on 2 and 3 October 2008 in New York which should provide the international community with the opportunity to assess progress made, lessons learned and constraints encountered in the implementation of the Almaty Program of Action and agree on what needs to be done to further galvanize the global partnership for development to assist landlocked developing countries in strengthening their effective participation in international trade and the world economy. The Ministers emphasized the need to continue to pay special attention to the situation of developing countries emerging from conflict, in particular LDCs, with a view to enabling them to rehabilitate and reconstruct, as appropriate, their political, social and economic infrastructures and to assist them in achieving their development objectives. Food Security The Ministers expressed their deep concern at the sharp rise in global food prices. The resulting food crisis poses a serious challenge to the fight against poverty and hunger, as well as to the efforts by developing countries to attain food security and achieve the objectives of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015 and other development goals. The multiple and complex causes of this crisis require a comprehensive, coordinated and sustained response by the international community. The Ministers also emphasized the need for global mechanisms to serve as an early warning system on food security to prevent the recurrence of food crises. The Ministers emphasized that achieving food security would require strengthening and revitalizing the agriculture sector in developing countries, including through the empowerment of small and medium scale farmers, technical assistance, access to and transfer of technology and exchange of knowledge and experience. The Ministers underscored that subsidies and other market distortions by developed countries have severely harmed the agricultural sector in developing countries, thereby limiting the ability of this key sector to contribute meaningfully to poverty eradication and sustained economic growth, food security and rural development. The Ministers, therefore, called for the immediate elimination of all forms of agricultural subsides and other market-distorting measures by developed countries. They urged the developed countries to demonstrate the necessary flexibility and political will to address meaningfully these key concerns of developing countries at the Doha Round of Trade Negotiations. The Ministers also called for short-term actions, including humanitarian assistance for ensuring the implementation of effective social safety nets. Short-term actions must include, inter alia, emergency aid measures to enhance capacity and effective delivery of food aid and ensure greater financial support to developing countries, particularly for food purchases. The Ministers reaffirmed that eradication of poverty is the greatest global challenge facing the world today. They reiterated the importance of developing countries determining their own food security strategies in their efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger. They noted regional initiatives in this regard, including the holding of the Presidential Summit in Managua, Nicaragua on Food Security and Sovereignty. They also expressed their support to the operationalisation of the World Solidarity Fund, and called for effective mobilization of necessary financial resources required in order to enable the Fund to start its activities, in accordance with GA resolution 57/265. The Ministers also reiterated that food should not be used as an instrument for political and economic pressure. They reaffirmed the importance of international cooperation and solidarity as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that endanger food security and are not in accordance with international law and the UN Charter. Recognizing the severity and urgency of the global food crisis, the Ministers underscored the need for the United Nations, with its universal membership, to play a leading role in addressing the crisis. They welcomed the holding of the FAO High-Level Conference on `World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate Change and Bioenergy' in Rome from June 3-5, 2008. They also noted the initiative of the Secretary General of the United Nations to establish a High Level Task Force on the Global Food Crisis, and called on the Task Force to intensively engage with the General Assembly and the ECOSOC and relevant international organizations. The Ministers proposed that the General Assembly convene a special meeting on food security and consider taking the issue of agriculture development and food security as its main theme for the 63rd session. Middle Income Developing Countries The Ministers recognised that Middle-Income Developing Countries still face significant development challenges, specially in the area of poverty eradication; and in this regard stressed the need to continue to support their development efforts in order to address those challenges, including by working in competent multilateral and international fora and also through bilateral arrangements on measures to enhance international cooperation with MICs and help them meet, inter alia, their financial technical and technological development requirements. The Ministers recalled the international conferences on development and cooperation with MICs held in March 2007 in Madrid, Spain and in October 2007 in San Salvador, El Salvador. They also welcomed the offer of the Government of Namibia to host the third international conference on development and cooperation with MICs to be held from 4-6 August -2008. Trade The Ministers expressed serious concern at the lack of substantial progress on the trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization and consider it a serious setback for the Doha Round, and call upon the developed countries to demonstrate the flexibility and political will necessary for breaking the current impasse in the negotiations, and also call upon all members of the World Trade Organization to adhere to the development mandate of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of 1 August 2004 and the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, which places development at the heart of the multilateral trading system. The Ministers also reiterated the importance of fully responding to the concerns raised by developing countries in paragraph 8 of the Doha Plan of Action, in particular, regarding the realisation of all areas of the Doha Work Programme, especially in Agriculture, Non-Agriculture Market Access, Services, Trade Related Intellectual Property System (TRIPS), Rules as well as operational and meaningful special and differential treatment for developing countries. They also called for action to accelerate the work on the development related mandate concerning the TRIPS Agreement and the implementation related issues in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, especially on the issues of making intellectual property rules of TRIPS supportive of the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity as well as trade-related aspects of the TRIPS and Public Health. The Ministers stressed that the use of agricultural subsidies by developed countries impedes the promotion of agricultural production in developing countries and urged the developed countries to eliminate all forms of agricultural subsidies and other market-distorting measures. The Ministers invited donors and beneficiary countries to implement the recommendations of the Task Force on the Aid for Trade Initiative established by the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, which aims to support developing and least developed countries in building their supply and export capacities, including infrastructure and institutions development, and the need to increase their exports, and stressed in this regard the urgent need for its effective operationalization with sufficient additional, non-conditional and predictable funding. The Ministers stressed the importance of facilitating the accession of all developing countries, in particular the LDCs, as well as countries with economies in transition, that apply for membership in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), consistent with its criteria and taking into account their development level, bearing in mind paragraph 21 of General Assembly resolution 55/182 and subsequent developments, and called for the effective and faithful application of the WTO guidelines on accession by the LDCs. The Ministers emphasized that accession process to WTO should be accelerated without political impediments and in an expeditious and transparent manner. The Ministers underscored the important role of UNCTAD as the focal point within the UN system for the integrated treatment of trade and development and interrelated issues in the areas of finance, technology, investment and sustainable development, should conduct research into an analysis of macroeconomic policies, trade, investment, finance, debt and poverty, and their interdependence. Such research should be used to help developing countries to meet their development goals including poverty eradication to improve the welfare of their citizens and to address the opportunities and challenges created by globalization. They further reiterated the need to continue the operationalization of UNCTAD's relevant functions in the areas of policy space and corporate responsibility and the reinvigoration of its intergovernmental machinery. The Ministers agreed to work towards a full implementation of the recommendations of the XII session of the UNCTAD's ministerial conference, held in Accra, Ghana from 20 to 25 April 2008. 284.1 Build a common position of G-77 and NAM seeking to strengthen the role of UNCTAD as the UN body in charge of an integrated treatment of trade, development and related matters in the field of finances, technology, investment and sustainable development, particularly in support of its XII Conference. 284.2 Continue promoting the rejection of and the adoption of concrete actions against the enforcement of unilateral coercive economic measures at the several multilateral fora where NAM and G-77 are involved. South-South Cooperation Recognising the increasing importance of South-South trade and economic cooperation, and the changing context of North-South interdependence and terms of engagement, the Ministers called for a more energetic effort to deepen and enhance South-South cooperation, including triangular cooperation, bearing in mind that such cooperation is not a substitute to North- South cooperation. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitments to fully implement the Havana Programme of Action, the Marrakech Plan of Implementation of South-South cooperation and the Doha Plan of Action that taken together represent a comprehensive framework for intensified cooperation among developing countries. The Ministers reiterated their support for the upcoming high-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, pursuant to General Assembly Resolution 62/209 to be held in 2009. The Ministers welcomed the launching of the Development Platform of the South and the approval of the South Fund for Development and Humanitarian Assistance during the 12th Session of the Intergovernmental Follow-up and Coordinating Committee on ECDC in Yamoussoukro, Cote d' Ivoire on June 13, 2008 and called for the launching of the Fund at the G77 Annual Ministerial Meeting in New York in September 2008. The Ministers reaffirmed the role of South-South cooperation in the overall context of multilateralism, as a continuing process vital to confront the challenges faced by the South and as valuable contribution to development, and the need to further strengthen it, including through enhancing the capacities of the institutions and the arrangements that promote such cooperation. The Ministers are committed to support and promote mechanisms enhancing intra/interregional trade among developing countries. The Ministers reiterated their invitation to all the parties involved to conclude the Third Round of the Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP) as early as possible and encouraged other developing countries to consider participating in the GSTP. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to further reinforce the following measures, among others: 292.1 Strengthen national capacities in order to enhance the individual and collective resilience of Non-Aligned Countries, which could be achieved particularly through expanding, deepening and enriching South-South cooperation in all areas of relations among them, including through undertaking concrete projects and programmes, pooling of resources, and tapping the contributions of eminent personalities and institutions of the South. In this regard, the South Fund for Development and Humanitarian Assistance established by the Second South Summit of the Group of 77 and China could greatly contribute to achieving the goals and objectives of South-South cooperation; 292.2 Encourage Member States to elaborate South-South cooperation arrangements, including sectoral cooperation arrangements, and other partnerships that promote South-South cooperation. 292.3 Promote on a voluntary basis trade agreements among developing countries as a tool for strengthening South-South economic cooperation; 292.4 Promote and strengthen regional and sub-regional integration through groupings and other arrangements on the basis of mutual benefit, complementarities and solidarity among developing countries with a view to facilitating and accelerating the economic growth and development of their economies; 292.5 Encourage the NAM Centre for South-South Technical Cooperation (NAM-CSSTC), consistent with its terms of reference, to continue to organize training and capacity building programs for Non-Aligned Countries, and in this regard, further encourage member states of NAM to provide necessary assistance on a voluntary basis to the Centre towards achieving its established goals and objectives; 292.6 Strengthen the capability of developing countries to evaluate international economic issues, through the establishment of a NAM network of coordination and cooperation between academic and specialized centres of research and economic studies; 292.7 They reaffirmed the central role of the South Centre as the think tank of the countries of the South, called upon the members of the Movement to support the Centre and requested the South Centre to establish South-South networks among relevant institutions to facilitate the exchange of programmes, academia, etc. 292.8 Encourage the NAM Business Forum on South-South Cooperation, consistent with its terms of reference, to continue with its initiatives to enhance South-South trade and business relations. In this context, they welcomed the success of the Second NAM Business Forum and the General Meeting of the NAM Business Council for South-South Cooperation, held in Havana, Cuba, on November 2007. 292.9 Encourage UN Member States to support international development funds aimed at financing the implementation of South-South Cooperation projects, such as the Perez Guerrero Trust Fund. The Ministers welcomed the cooperation initiatives and the substantial financial contributions made by some NAM countries, including inter alia OPEC countries based on solidarity and principles of friendship among states, which are conducive to the realization of human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights, and the right to development, as well as initiatives for scientific and research programs on energy, environment and climate change, as decided at the OPEC Summit in Riyadh in November 2007. In this regard, they encouraged member states to consider supporting and engaging in those mechanisms of cooperation or other relevant regional or sub-regional arrangements of a cooperative nature International Migration and Development The Ministers reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts; in particular acts of incitement to ethnic, racial and religious discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups, and urged them to reinforce measures in this regard. The Ministers agreed to effectively promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants regardless of their immigration status, especially those of women and children, in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all relevant international instruments to which they are party. The Ministers reaffirmed that, when exercising their sovereign right to enact and implement migratory and border security measures, States have the duty to comply with their obligations under international law, including international human rights law, in order to ensure full respect for the human rights of migrants. The Ministers recognised that trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants continue to pose a serious challenge to humanity and require concerted international response, and urged to that end, all States to devise, enforce and strengthen effective measures to prevent, combat and eliminate all forms of trafficking in persons to counter the demand for trafficked victims and to protect the victims, in particular women and children subjected to forced labour, or sexual or commercial exploitation, violence and sexual abuse. The Ministers took note of the First Meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, held in Brussels on 9-11 July, 2007, which focused on the central theme: "Migration and socio-economic development" in recognition of the importance of this issue. They recognized that the exchange of expertise, consultation and closer cooperation between the Global Forum on Migration and Development and the United Nations system, could have a positive impact. The Ministers welcomed the offer of the Government of the Philippines to host the Second Meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development in Manila from 27 to 30 October, 2008. They also took note with interest the Manila GFMD's central theme: "Protection and Empowerment of Migrants for Development," and particularly welcomed the inclusion of the topic of the human rights of migrants. The Ministers encouraged efforts by Member States and the international community to promote a balanced and comprehensive approach to international migration and development, particularly by building partnerships and ensuring coordinated action to develop capacities, including for the management of migration. The Ministers noted the results of the High-Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development in September 2006 in New York, held for purpose of discussing the multidimensional aspects of international migration and development, which recognized the relationship between international migration, development and human rights. The Ministers, recognizing the critical linkages between international migration and development, reiterated the importance of effective initiatives to promote safe migration and facilitate free movement of labour. In this context, they emphasized that the Doha development round should conclude with a comprehensive solution to the concerns expressed by developing countries, taking into account their interests and objectives regarding the positive impacts of labour migration both in sending and receiving states. The Ministers took note of the initiatives undertaken by Member States, relevant regional and international inter-governmental organisations at the regional and international levels to promote dialogue and cooperation on international migration and development, including their contribution to comprehensively address international migration. The Ministers emphasized the need for countries of destination of migrants to adopt policies to reduce the cost of transferring migrants' remittances to developing countries without any bias or discrimination. The Ministers further underscored the need for the international community to address the negative impact the migration of highly skilled personnel and those with advanced education from many developing countries has on the development efforts of their country of origin. The Ministers invited all states that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. The Ministers called upon all relevant bodies, agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental, regional and sub-regional organizations, within their respective mandates, to continue to address the issue of international migration and development, with a view to integrating migration issues, in a more coherent way, within the broader context of the implementation of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. Water The Ministers stressed the need to assist developing countries in their efforts to prepare integrated water resources management and water efficiency plans as part of their national development strategies and to provide access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in accordance with the Millennium Declaration and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, including halving by 2015 of the proportion of people who are unable to reach or afford safe drinking water and who do not have access to basic sanitation. The Ministers stressed the need to intensify water pollution prevention to reduce health hazards and protect ecosystems by introducing technologies for affordable sanitation and industrial and domestic wastewater treatment, by mitigating the effects of groundwater contamination and by establishing, at the national level, monitoring systems and effective legal frameworks. The Ministers recalled what was agreed by the 13th Session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in 2005 and the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in November 2002, that recognised the importance of water as a vital and finite natural resource, which has an economic, social and environmental function, and acknowledged the right to water for all. The Ministers emphasized the need to improve water resource management and scientific understanding of the water cycle through cooperation in joint observation and research, and for this purpose, reiterated the need to encourage and promote knowledge-sharing and provide capacity-building and the transfer of technology, as mutually agreed, including remote-sensing and satellite technologies, particularly to developing countries and countries with economies in transition. The Dead Sea The Ministers once again expressed concern over the continuous deterioration and degradation of the unique ecosystem of the Dead Sea and emphasized the importance of working progressively towards reversing this environmental catastrophe. They drew attention of the international community to the need for international action to protect the Dead Sea and prevent any further environmental degradation of its ecosystem through concessional grants. The Caribbean Sea The Ministers reiterated their concern over the continued shipment of hazardous wastes through the waters of the Caribbean Sea. In recognition of the cooperative efforts of Caribbean States to promote an integrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea in the context of sustainable development of the oceans and seas, they welcomed resolution 61/197 of the United Nations General Assembly, and stressed the importance to continue working on the implementation of the declaration of Mauritius (January 2005). In this regard, they expressed support for the regional initiatives aimed at having the Caribbean Sea declared a "special area", and they pledged their support to assist in promoting the sustainable development of this group of especially vulnerable countries, for which international cooperation continues to be an essential factor, and drew the attention of the international community to the need for international action for the Caribbean Sea to be considered as a special area within the context of sustainable development. Lake Chad and the River Niger The Ministers expressed serious concern over the phenomenal drying-up of Lake Chad and the shrinking of the River Niger, largely due to climate change and rapidly growing population, thereby posing serious danger to biodiversity, as well as threatening food security and the livelihood of the peoples living within the vicinities of the Lake and the River in the West and Central African subRegions. They acknowledged the concerted efforts by the affected countries to reverse the trend and redress the challenges posed, and therefore called on the international community and development partners to intensify their support, through concrete financial and technical assistance, for the collaborative frameworks of action by the affected countries, aimed at rescuing Lake Chad and River Niger. Energy The Ministers emphasized the need to diversify energy supply by developing advanced, cleaner, more efficient, affordable and cost-effective energy technologies, including fossil fuel technologies and renewable energy technologies, hydro included, and their transfer to developing countries on concessional terms as mutually agreed. With a sense of urgency, substantially increase the global share of renewable energy sources with the objective of increasing its contribution to total energy supply, recognizing the role of national and voluntary targets as well as initiatives, where they exist, and ensuring that energy policies are supportive to developing countries' efforts to eradicate poverty, and regularly evaluate available date to review progress to this end. The Ministers emphasized the need to accelerate the development, dissemination and deployment of affordable and cleaner energy efficiency and energy conservation technologies, new and renewable energy technologies as well as the transfer of such technologies, in particular to developing countries, on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms. In this context, they requested the President of the General Assembly to convene an informal thematic debate on this subject during its 63rd session. The Ministers noted the challenges to development that exist for a number of member states of the Movement in relation to the international oil market. They also took note of the various and varied complex market destabilizing factors in the oil sector. In this context, they supported efforts to improve the functioning, transparency and information about energy markets with respect to both supply and demand, with the aim of achieving greater stability and predictability in the interest of both oil producing and consuming states. They agreed to enhance cooperation with a view to improving access to energy including alternative sources of energy by developing countries. They underscored the need for increased North-South collaboration as well as continued South-South Cooperation as part of a long-term strategy towards sustainable development. They also underscored the sovereign right of States over the management of their energy resources. Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms The Ministers reaffirmed the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms, as follows: 318.1 The Ministers reaffirmed the significant importance attached by the Movement to the promotion and protection of human rights and commitment to fulfil obligations to promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in accordance with the UN Charter, other instruments relating to human rights, as appropriate, and international law. They further reaffirmed that all human rights, in particular the right to development, are universal, inalienable, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that human rights issues must be addressed within the global context through a constructive, dialogue-based approach, in a fair and equal manner, with objectivity, respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, impartiality, non-selectivity and transparency as the guiding principles, taking into account the political, historical, social, religious and cultural particularities of each country. In this regard, they reiterated the Movement's dismay and unequivocal condemnation of gross and systematic violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and situations that constitute serious obstacles to their full enjoyment, as well as violent acts and activities that infringe upon their full enjoyment; 318.2 The Ministers also reaffirmed their opposition to all unilateral coercive measures, including those measures used as tools for political or economic pressure against any country, in particular against developing countries. They reaffirmed that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their own means of subsistence and development. The Ministers further expressed their concern at the continued imposition of such measures which hinder the well being of population of the affected countries and that create obstacles to the full realization of their human rights. 318.3 The Ministers further reaffirm that, bearing in mind the UN Charter, economic and financial sanctions always have a negative impact on the rights recognized in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in particular the realization of the right to development. They often cause significant disruption in the distribution of food, pharmaceuticals and sanitation supplies, jeopardize the quality of food and the availability of clean drinking water, severely interfere with the functioning of basic health and education systems, and undermine the right to work. 318.4 The Ministers expressed concern that defamation of religions is being wrongly justified on the ground of the right to freedom of expression, neglecting the restrictions clearly articulated in the relevant human rights instruments including paragraph 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as paragraph 3 of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), including in this regard the relevant recommendations of the treaty bodies, and stressed the need for all States to continue international efforts to enhance dialogue and broaden understanding among civilisations, cultures and religions, and emphasizing that States, regional organisations, non-governmental Organisations, religious bodies and the media have an important role to play in promoting tolerance, respect for and freedom of religion and belief. They reaffirmed the obligation of all States Parties to the Covenant under article 20 which prohibits the advocacy of racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. They also welcomed the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the Right to freedom of opinion and expression as revised by the HRC resolution 7/36. 318.5 The Ministers affirmed that while it is necessary to harmonise guidelines on reporting procedure of human rights treaty bodies, greater efforts should be made to ensure that their work would be more effective, objective, transparent and accountable, as well as to ensure a more balanced membership therein, in accordance with the principle of equitable geographical representation, gender balance, as well as ensuring that members nominated to serve with the treaty bodies will serve in their personal capacity, of high moral character, acknowledged impartiality, and possess competence in the field of human rights; 318.6 The Ministers expressed concern over the nonrepresentation and under-representation of Non-Aligned Countries in the staffing of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), bearing in mind the fundamental importance of the need to adhere to the principle of equitable geographical distribution. 318.7 They reaffirmed that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should discharge his (her) duties in compliance with the mandate established under the UNGA Resolution 48/141, including reporting annually to the General Assembly, a universal organ of the United Nations; 318.8 The Ministers re-emphasized that the exploitation and the use of human rights as an instrument for political purposes, including selective targeting of individual Countries for extraneous considerations, which is contrary to the Founding Principles of the Movement and the UN Charter, should be prohibited. They urged that, in the discussion on human rights, adequate attention be given to the issues of poverty, underdevelopment, marginalisation, instability and foreign occupation that engender social and economic exclusion and violation of human dignity and human rights, which cannot be divorced from any meaningful discussion relating to human rights; 318.9 The Ministers reaffirmed that democracy and good governance at the national and international levels, development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to development, are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Adoption, for any cause or consideration, of coercive unilateral measures, rules and policies against the developing countries constitute flagrant violations of the basic rights of their populations. It is essential for States to promote efforts to combat extreme poverty and hunger (MDGs 1) as well as foster participation by the poorest members of society in decision-making processes; 318.10 The Ministers reaffirmed that hunger constitutes a violation of human dignity and called for urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination. They also reaffirmed the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food consistent with the right to food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities. 318.11 The Ministers renewed their concern at the gross violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to life and the right to development, resulting from terrorist acts including those perpetrated by foreign occupying powers in territories under foreign occupation, and reiterated their condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, in accordance with the relevant UN resolutions; 318.12 The Ministers underlined their growing concern and dismay at the flagrant disregard for life and the accompanying wanton destruction of property, as recently evidenced in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories, including the occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanon. The Ministers welcomed the adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, whereby it decided to include the "Human Rights Situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories" as a permanent agenda item in the Council; 318.13 The Ministers reaffirmed the right of people under colonial or alien domination and foreign occupation to struggle for national liberation and self-determination; 318.14 The Ministers reiterated the need for efforts to further strengthen and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and for the establishment of democratic institutions and sound economic policies responsive to the needs of the people. In this context, they reiterated the need for the core principles, such as equity, non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, participation and international co-operation, including partnership and commitments in the international financial, monetary and trading systems, and full and effective participation of developing countries in decision-making and norm setting; and 318.15 The Ministers welcomed the recent election of women at highest political level, including as Heads of State and Government such as in Chile, Jamaica, Liberia and India. They underlined the importance of promoting equal participation of women in the political system of Non-Aligned Countries, in accordance with Millennium Development Goal No. 3 "Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women". 318.16 The Ministers welcomed the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol, on 3 May 2008 and expressed their commitment to promote the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis for persons with disabilities. The Ministers invited all States that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the Convention and its Optional Protocol. 318.17 The Ministers expressed deep concern over the "Common Standards and Procedures for returning illegally-staying Third-Country Nationals", known as the return directive, adopted by the European Parliament on June 18, 2008. They emphasized the view that this Directive constitutes a serious violation of relevant international human rights instruments, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant ILO conventions. They also underscored the discriminatory nature of this Directive, which has the effect of criminalizing migration and exacerbating social tensions, racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and entail mistreatment of migrants and their families. 318.18 The Ministers underscored the need for all States to address the issue of international migration in a cooperative dialogue on an equal footing, and in this regard, strongly urged the European Union and its member States to refrain from taking any type of measures that stigmatize certain groups or individuals, including third-country nationals and their families and invite these States to consider signing and ratifying the international convention on Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families. The Ministers recognized the importance of Human Rights Education for the promotion and protection of human rights, and in this regard, welcome the adoption by consensus of HRC resolution 6/10, which launched the process of the elaboration of a United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training;. They also welcomed the adoption of the UNGA resolution 62/171 that decides that the year commencing on 10 December 2008 shall be proclaimed the international year of human rights learning. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures and initiatives, among others: 320.1 Promote and protect all universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms for all peoples, in particular the right to development, and to provide an effective framework thereof including remedies to redress grievances on or violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the relevant Founding Principles of the Movement, the UN Charter and international human rights instruments, consistent with the obligations of States regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems;

Racism, Racial Discrimination and Slavery The Ministers reaffirmed their condemnation of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including the platforms and activities related thereto, which constitute serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as impede equal opportunity. They reminded the international community to preserve its recognition that slavery and slave trade, including trans-Atlantic slave trade, are crimes against humanity, and that the legacies of slavery, slave trade, colonialism, foreign occupation, alien domination, genocide and other forms of servitude have manifested themselves in poverty, underdevelopment, marginalisation, social exclusion and economic disparities for the developing world. The Ministers welcomed the adoption of General Assembly resolutions 61/19 and 62/122 related to the abolition of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and its consequences. The Ministers endorsed and supported ongoing efforts towards the erection of a Permanent Memorial to the victims of slavery and the trans-Atlantic slave trade, to be prominently placed at the United Nations. They took note of the establishment of a fund for this purpose, expressed appreciation to those of its members that have already made contributions towards it and encouraged others to follow suit. The Ministers expressed grave concern at the negative effects on human rights and development posed by contemporary forms of slavery and trafficking in persons and at the increasing vulnerability of States to such crimes. They reaffirmed the need to work collectively to combat contemporary forms of slavery and trafficking in persons. The Ministers expressed dismay at instances of religious and cultural prejudices, misunderstanding, intolerance and discrimination on the basis of religion or beliefs or different systems, which undermine the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and hinder the promotion of the culture of peace. Pluralism, tolerance, and understanding of religious and cultural diversity are essential for peace and harmony. Acts of prejudice, discrimination, stereotyping, and racial, religious and sectarian profiling are affronts to human dignity and equality, and should not be condoned. Respect for democracy and human rights and the promotion of understanding and tolerance by governments as well as between and among minorities are central to the promotion and protection of human rights. They reaffirmed that States have the duty to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination and in full equality before the law. In recalling the Movement's opposition to all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and expressing serious concern on the resurgence of contemporary forms of such abhorrent crimes in various parts of the world, the Ministers took note of the ongoing progress made by States at the national, regional and international levels, focusing on the comprehensive follow-up to the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance and the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Program of Action. To this end, the Ministers urged the Human Rights Council, through the Intergovernmental Working Group established to that effect, to proceed with the elaboration of complementary standards to the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Ministers also drew attention to the importance and urgent need that the United Nations Organization secures in a timely fashion the necessary resources for the successful organization of the Durban Review Conference. The Ministers encouraged the active participation and coordination of positions of NAM countries in the preparatory process leading up to the Durban Review Conference to be held in Geneva in April 2009. The Ministers called upon the Durban Review Conference and its preparatory process to encourage debates on promotion of respect for cultural diversity among all nations, in the context of global fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, International Humanitarian Law The Ministers urged that due priority should continue to be given to promoting knowledge of, respect for and observance of obligations assumed under International Humanitarian Law, in particular those of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their 1977 Protocols, and they encouraged States to consider ratifying or acceding to the two 1977 Additional Protocols. The Ministers called upon all parties to armed conflict to redouble their efforts to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, by, inter alia, prohibiting the targeting of civilian populations and civilian objects during an armed conflict, and obliging parties to any conflict to ensure general protection against dangers arising from military operations for civilian installations, hospitals and relief materials, means of transportation and distribution of such relief materials. The Ministers reiterated the Movement's condemnation of the increasing attacks on the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and urged the Governments of UN Member States to ensure respect for the protection of the personnel of humanitarian organisations in conformity with the relevant international law. Humanitarian agencies and their personnel should respect the laws of the countries they work in and the principles of neutrality and non-interference, as well as cultural, religious and other values of the population in the countries where they operate. The Ministers recalled the protection granted by international humanitarian law and relevant human rights instruments to persons captured in connection with international armed conflicts. 333.1 Invite those States, which have not yet done so, to consider ratifying the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and its two Additional Protocols; 333.2 Urge States to comply fully with the provisions of international humanitarian law, in particular as provided in the Geneva Conventions, in order to protect and assist civilians in occupied territories, and further urge the international community and the relevant organisations within the UN system to strengthen humanitarian assistance to civilians under foreign occupation; and 333.3 Stress that all detainees or persons captured in connection with international armed conflicts must be treated humanely and with respect for their inherent dignity granted by international humanitarian law and relevant human rights instruments. Humanitarian Assistance The Ministers reaffirmed that the provision of humanitarian assistance must not be politicised and must be in full respect of the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality as set forth in General Assembly Resolution 46/182 and its annex as providing the guiding principles for the coordination of humanitarian assistance, and emphasized that all UN humanitarian entities and associated organisations must act in accordance with their respective mandates, international humanitarian law and national law. They further reaffirmed that the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of States must be fully respected in accordance with the UN Charter. In this context, they stressed that humanitarian assistance should be provided under the principle of request and consent of the affected country. The Ministers reaffirmed the Movement's commitment to enhance international cooperation to provide humanitarian assistance in full compliance with the UN Charter, and in this regard, they reiterated the rejection by the Movement of the so-called "right" of humanitarian intervention, which has no basis either in the UN Charter or in international law. The Ministers called upon the international community to provide full support, including financial resources, for emergency humanitarian assistance at all levels and stressed the need to maintain the follow-up, oversight and review by the General Assembly of the activities undertaken by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to ensure its functioning according to the agreed principles contained in the relevant UN resolutions, in particular General Assembly Resolution 46/182; The Ministers expressed their concern over the human suffering and economic impact caused by the natural disasters throughout the world, in particular the tragic loss of life caused by natural disasters in China and Myanmar. They encouraged the international community, national authorities and non-governmental organisations, to promote closer cooperation to respond to natural disasters by strengthening emergency preparedness and disaster management measures such as regional disaster, early warning systems as well as exchange of information. The Ministers further encouraged States to implement commitments related to assistance for developing countries that are prone to natural disasters and for disaster-stricken states in the transition phase towards sustainable physical, social and economic recovery, for risk-reduction activities in post-disaster recovery and for rehabilitation processes. The Ministers recognised the importance of the review of mandates related to humanitarian assistance, which is being carried out in the General Assembly, and undertook to continue to coordinate positions to safeguard the main interests of NAM on this issue. Information and Communication Technology The Ministers welcomed the participation of the Heads of State and Government of the Movement in the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) at its second phase held in Tunis from 16 to 18 November 2005, and reiterated the need for the implementation and follow up of the outcomes of the both phases of the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS), held in Geneva and Tunis. In this context, they stressed the importance of the contribution of the Non-Aligned Countries toward achieving the development oriented outcomes of the Summits, the Tunis commitment and the full implementation of the agenda for the Information Society, and urged UN Member States, relevant UN bodies and other intergovernmental organisations, as well as civil society, including non-governmental organisations and private sector in implementation of the outcomes. The Ministers by commending active participation of the Member States in the World Summit on the Information Society and taking note of the follow-up activities at international, regional and national levels, reaffirmed that in order to transform the digital divide to digital opportunities, these activities should ensure the imperative of universal, inclusive and non-discriminatory access to knowledge regarding ICT, and should result in supporting national efforts in developing countries in the area of building, improving and strengthening capacities to facilitate their genuine involvement in all aspects of the information society and knowledge economy. They encouraged all the States to contribute actively to ensuring that the Information Society is founded on and stimulates respect for cultural identity, cultural and linguistic diversity, traditions and religions and ethical values. The Ministers called for the responsible use and treatment of information by the media in accordance with codes of conduct and professional ethics Media in all their forms have an important role in the Information Society and ICTs should play a supportive role in this regard. They reaffirmed the necessity of reducing international imbalances affecting the media, particularly as regards infrastructure, technical resources and the development of human skills. The Ministers highly commended Malaysia for chairing the Sixth Conference of Ministers of Information of the Non-Aligned Countries (COMINAC-VI), and highly commended Venezuela for hosting the 7th Conference of Ministers of Information of the Non-Aligned Countries (COMINAC-VII), held in Venezuela, 2-4 July 2008 and for the substantive outcome document and Programme of Action, that they adopted and they expressed the Movement's resolve and commitment to implement the decisions and recommendations contained therein. The Ministers concurred on the importance of strengthening and consolidating the work of the NAM News Network (NNN). The Ministers expressed their appreciation to Malaysia for launching and supporting the NNN since its inception in 2003. The Ministers welcomed the Digital Solidarity Fund (DSF) established in Geneva as an innovative financial mechanism of a voluntary nature open to interested stakeholders with the objective of transforming the digital divide into digital opportunities for the developing world by focusing mainly on specific and urgent needs at the local level and seeking new voluntary sources of "solidarity" finance. The DSF will complement existing mechanisms for funding the Information Society, which should continue to be fully utilized to fund the growth of new ICT infrastructure and services. The Ministers expressed their opposition to the dissemination of discriminatory and distorted information of events taking place in developing countries. In this regard, they strongly supported the efforts made to revitalise the Broadcasting Organizations of Non Aligned Countries (BONAC), as an effective medium for transmitting factual news of events of the developing countries to the world. They also took note of the valuable experience of "The new south TV" (TELESUR) in this respect. The Ministers reiterated their support for Tunis Agenda for Information Society, especially its development content and stressed the importance of effective participation of equitable and effective representation from developing countries in the implementation of the outcomes of the WSIS process, including for the Internet Governance Forum and for Enhanced Cooperation. The Ministers underlined the conclusion of the World Summit on the Information Society that internet governance, carried out according to the Geneva principles, constitutes a core issue of the Information Society agenda and that all governments should have an equal role and responsibility for international Internet governance and invited the Member States, to maximize their participation in decisions regarding Internet governance, in order to reflect their interests in related processes. They also reaffirmed the WSIS conviction on the need for enhanced cooperation, to enable governments, on an equal footing, to carry out their roles and responsibilities in international public policy issues pertaining to the Internet. The Ministers, therefore strongly urged the UN Secretary General to start urgently the process towards enhanced cooperation, as referred to in paragraphs 69 to 71 of the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society of the second phase of the Summit. 349.1 Work for the full implementation and follow-up of the outcomes of both phases of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), and in this context, promote effective and equitable participation of NAM countries in this process; 349.2 Increase cooperation to promote a New World Information and Communication Order, based on universal, inclusive and non-discriminatory access to information and knowledge relating to ICT, as an essential requirement to reduce the growing digital divide between developed and developing countries; 349.3 Call for an immediate end to the misuse of media for inciting and launching campaigns against NAM members, including, inter alia, the hostile use of radio and electronic transmissions contrary to the principles of the International Law, as well as the dissemination of discriminatory and distorted information of events in developing countries, and campaigns that defame religions, cultures and symbols; 349.4 Support and strengthen the implementation of the Isla Margarita Declaration and Programme of Action. Advancement of Women The Ministers recommitted the Movement to the implementation of the Declaration and Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women as well as fully supported the outcome of the five-year review and appraisal contained in "Further Actions and Initiatives" to implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted by the 23rd Special Session of the UN General Assembly of June 2000. The Ministers expressed their resolve to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and the girl child especially in situations of armed conflict and foreign occupation, including the systematic use of abduction and rape by the parties to the conflict, including as an instrument of war, as well as the trafficking in and victimization of women and the girl child. They expressed their abhorrence at the continuation of such acts. In this regard, they called upon States to take the necessary measures against the perpetrators of such acts and to ensure adherence to international law and domestic legislation, including legislating the protection of women and the girl child in situations of armed conflict. They further invited States, which have not done so, to consider ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and encouraged Member States to consider ratifying or acceding to its Optional Protocol. The Ministers took note of the establishment of the gender branch within the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to promote and protect women's human rights within the context of the Human Rights Council. In this context, the Ministers cautioned that its operations should not be in conflict with the existing partnership between the Division for the Advancement of Women and the Commission on the Status of Women. The Ministers underscored the fact that the Commission of the Status of Women has a broad mandate covering other social and economic dimensions beyond women's human rights. The Ministers reaffirmed the primary and essential role of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, as well as the central role of the Commission on the Status of Women that has a broad mandate covering all dimensions related to women's development, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Ministers reaffirmed and underscored the validity and relevance of the Movement's principled positions concerning the institutional reform of the UN and stressed that the purpose of the reform, including in the area of gender, is to make the UN development system more efficient and effective in its support to developing countries to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, on the basis of their national development strategies and that reform efforts should enhance organisational efficiency and achieve concrete development results; The Ministers in order to promote the human rights of women expressed their resolve to take appropriate measures at the national, regional and international levels to improve the quality of life and achieve gender equality and empowerment of women, bearing in mind the inherent potential of women, through inter alia adopting proper socio- economic strategies and programmes and provisions of government services to all women particularly women with disabilities and women in rural areas, including access to health, education and justice services and strengthening family well-being. The Ministers reaffirmed their compromise to actively promote the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and social spheres, ensuring full representation and full and equal participation of women as critical factor in the eradication of poverty. The Ministers recalled with satisfaction the 1st NAM Ministerial Meeting on the Advancement of Women, held in Putrajaya, Malaysia from 7 to 10 May 2005 and reaffirmed the Movement's resolve and commitment to fully implement the decisions and recommendations contained in the substantive outcome document adopted by the conference. The Ministers welcomed the establishment of the NAM Institute for the Empowerment of Women in Kuala Lumpur and reaffirmed their commitment to actively support it and participate in its activities. The Ministers welcomed the adoption of the Resolution 62/136 on improvement of the situation of women in rural areas and recognized the important role played by rural women in their societies and the need to fully implement the relevant provisions of that resolution in order to empower rural women and improve their situation. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions and affirming the need to defend, preserve and promote these positions, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measure and initiatives, among others: 360.1 Hold the Second NAM Ministerial Meeting on the Advancement of Women in 7-10 December 2008, to be hosted by Guatemala. In this regard, they urged all NAM members to participate actively. Likewise, they exhorted those NAM countries in a position to do so to contribute financially or otherwise to support the Government of Guatemala in the organizational and logistical aspects of this event. Indigenous Peoples The Ministers took note with deep appreciation of the adoption of the UN Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples by the General Assembly. Likewise, they reiterated their support for the need to promote the economic, political and cultural rights of the indigenous peoples and their commitment to give special attention to the efforts made at the national and multilateral levels in order to improve their living conditions through civil participation. Likewise, in face of undue appropriation and use of the traditional indigenous knowledge, they agreed to promote the defence of the bio-cultural collective heritage to allow indigenous peoples to have appropriate legal instruments on intellectual property so that their traditional knowledge is protected against unauthorized or inappropriate use by third parties. The Ministers also supported the need to promote within the UN system, in particular its agencies, funds and programmes, the rights of indigenous peoples, through a series of policies and programmes for the improvement of indigenous peoples' well-being around the world and, where applicable, through the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Ministers took note with appreciation of the adoption of the Human Rights Council resolution 6/36 of 14 December 2007, that established the expert mechanism on the rights of indigenous peoples to provide the Council with thematic expertise on the rights of indigenous peoples. Illiteracy The Ministers expressed their deep concern over the fact that around 75 million children had no access to primary education, 774 million adults are illiterate and more than two-thirds of these illiterates can be found in Africa and Asia. Without accelerated progress towards education for all, national and internationally agreed targets for poverty reduction would be missed, and inequalities between countries and within societies would widen. In this regard, they reiterated the Movement's continued support and full commitment to cooperate in attaining the MDGs and the goals of the UN Literacy Decade (2003-2012). In this context, the Ministers decided to give priority attention to the development of cooperation schemes among NAM Members States, as well as to the strengthening of regional and international cooperation to effectively address and eradicate illiteracy, in the fulfilment of the second MDG by 2015. The Ministers acknowledged the progress made in the implementation of various literacy initiatives. The Ministers decided to create literate environments and societies, eradicating illiteracy, including among women and girls and eliminating the gender gap in literacy, inter alia, by intensifying efforts to implement effectively the International Plan of Action for the United Nations Literacy Decade and integrating substantially those efforts in the Education for All process and other activities of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), as well as other literacy initiatives within the framework of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. Health, HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis and other communicable diseases The Ministers expressed their concern at the global threat posed by health epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other communicable diseases. In this context, they called on the Member States of the United Nations at the national, regional and international levels to enhance their cooperation to confront and combat these scourges. The Ministers recognized that HIV/AIDS constitutes a global emergency and poses one of the most formidable challenges to the development, progress and stability of their respective societies and the world at large, and requires an exceptional and comprehensive global response. They welcomed the political declaration on HIV/AIDS adopted by the High-Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS of the United Nations General Assembly on 2 June 2006, and called on Member States of the United Nations to scale up significantly their efforts towards the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010, and thereby, called upon all States, especially developed countries to implement fully these commitments, and urged the international organizations, non-governmental organizations and the business sector to support national efforts in this regard. The Ministers recognized the achievement of South-South cooperation in the fight against HIV/AIDS and decided to give priority attention to the development of cooperation schemes among NAM Member States, as well as to the strengthening of regional and international cooperation to effectively address HIV/AIDS in the fulfilment of MDGs 6 and 8. In this regard, they welcomed the organization of the High-Level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on HIV-AIDS in New York, 10-11 June 2008. The Ministers expressed grave concern over the serious threat posed by the spread of Avian Influenza since its first major reported outbreak, which has potential to produce severe impact not only on public health worldwide but also on the global economy. They reiterated that it is imperative that concerted actions be undertaken at the national, regional and international levels to address this challenge in an effective and timely manner. The Ministers highlighted the organisation of the Meeting of NAM Ministers of Health, held 21 May 2008, in Geneva, Switzerland, and expressed their support to the outcome documents adopted therein and their determination and commitment to fully implement their decisions and recommendations and consistently follow up on these issues. Transnational Organised Crime The Ministers reiterated the Movement's commitment to co-ordinate the efforts and strategies at national, regional and international levels against transnational crime and to develop the methods most effective in combating crime of this nature. They reaffirmed that international efforts against transnational crime should be carried out with the necessary respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. The Ministers reaffirmed that organised criminal activities adversely affect development, political stability and social and cultural values. The Ministers reiterated that responding to the threat posed by transnational organised crime requires close cooperation at international level. They renewed their commitment to fight all forms of transnational organized crime by strengthening national legal frameworks, where applicable, and cooperation mechanisms, in particular through the exchange of information, mutual legal assistance and extradition in accordance with domestic law and international instruments as appropriate The Ministers strongly believed that comprehensive crime prevention strategies must address, inter alia, the root causes and risk factors related to crimes. They recalled that the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice and the Bangkok Declaration recognized that comprehensive crime prevention must address the root causes and risk factors of crime. The Ministers expressed their concern about the seriousness of trafficking in human organs and the increasing involvement of organized criminal groups in this crime and they agreed to coordinate their efforts to fight this crime. The Ministers also expressed their concern over the loss, destruction and removal of the cultural property and the increased involvement of organised criminal groups in trafficking in looted, stolen or smuggled cultural property. The Ministers underlined the importance of national, regional and international initiatives for the protection of cultural property, in particular the work of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and its Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in Case of Illicit Appropriation, and Stressed the importance of fostering international law enforcement cooperation to combat trafficking in cultural property and in particular the need to exchange information and experiences in order to operate in a more effective way. Consistent with and guided by the afore-mentioned principled positions, the Ministers agreed to undertake the following measures, among others: 378.1 Take necessary steps at the national and international levels for the implementation of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the international instruments against illicit drug trafficking, where appropriate; 378.2 Call for adequate financial and technical assistance and cooperation to enable developing countries and countries with economies in transition to implement those treaties; 378.3 Strengthen international cooperation and technical assistance for capacity-building in developing countries and countries with economies in transition for effective implementation of the obligations set forth in existing international crime prevention instruments; and 378.4 Adopt further measures and strengthen international cooperation in order to prevent, combat, punish and eradicate all forms of transnational organized crime more effectively, in accordance with international law. 378.5 Strengthen coordination and cooperation, as well as the formulation of common strategies with the Group of 77 and China, through the Joint Coordinating Committee (JCC), on issues relative to transnational organized crime to address the collective concerns and promote the common interests of developing countries in international fora, in particular in connection with the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, which will be held in October 2008. Trafficking in Persons The Ministers expressed concern that trafficking in persons is increasingly becoming a global scourge affecting all countries around the world and requires a concerted national and international response. They stressed the importance of the 2000 United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, including, inter alia, in situations of armed conflict. The Ministers welcomed the increased efforts to intensify the consideration of this issue in the United Nations General Assembly including the recent convening of the thematic debate on 3 June 2008, as well as in regional organizations and through bilateral cooperation and partnerships. The Ministers further welcomed the establishment of the United Nations Global initiative to fight human trafficking (UNGIFT) to coordinate actions between the United Nations system, civil society, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, in order to assist Governments, upon their request, to ensure the prosecution and prevention of human trafficking, as well as to ensure that victims are accorded all the necessary remedies and their human rights are fully protected. The Ministers recognised that slavery and trafficking in persons continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted international response. To that end, they urged all States to devise, enforce and strengthen effective measures to combat and eliminate all forms of slavery and trafficking in persons to counter demand for trafficked victims and to protect the victims and to bring perpetrators to justice. The Ministers reiterated their invitation to all States that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, and following its entry into force, to implement the Protocol effectively, including by incorporating its provisions into national legislation and by strengthening criminal justice systems. They expressed the Movement's resolve to strengthen the capacity of the UN and other international organisations to provide assistance to Member States, upon request, in implementing the Protocol. The Ministers took note with appreciation of the convening of the Vienna Forum to fight human trafficking on 13 to 15 February 2008 and the thematic debate of the General Assembly on human trafficking on 3 of June 2008. The Ministers urged all States, individually and through international cooperation, to increase efforts to counter trafficking in persons, including through their active contribution to shape a global partnership against slavery and trafficking in persons in the twenty-first century, aimed at improving coordination and information exchange, especially in protecting rights of victims of trafficking. To that end, they recognized the need for coherent and comprehensive approach of the United Nations to the problem of trafficking in persons and encouraged all states to consider a UN plan of action or guidelines to be adopted by the General Assembly on combating trafficking in persons. Bearing in mind the increased development of the phenomenon of the traffic in persons, the Ministers invited the States to prevent and fight this phenomenon by the reinforcement of the legislation in this field raising awareness and the setting up of national and local institutions dedicated to the fight against this scourge. Drug Trafficking The Ministers expressed grave concern at the worsening problem of illicit drug trafficking worldwide on account of its transnational and global nature, which constitutes a serious threat to the entire international community. They reiterated that more effective measures must be taken to prevent, combat and eradicate the world drug problem in all its aspects. They further, recognized that no single government can combat this menace alone successfully, given that criminal organisations linked to drug trafficking operate collectively in the territory of several countries and are multiplying traffic routes and distribution methods, therefore cooperation, co-ordination and committed action by all countries are essential to curb this crime. They reiterated that effective measures must be taken to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which is also linked to illicit drugs trafficking. Consistent with the said position, the Ministers reiterated that the fight against the world drug problem is a common and shared responsibility that should be tackled in a multilateral framework and that can only be dealt with effectively through meaningful international cooperation, and, it demands an integrated and balanced approach and should be carried out in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and other provisions of international law, in particular the respect for national sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in their internal affairs; and based on the principles of equal rights and mutual respect. Likewise, the Ministers expressed concern over the financial situation of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), while welcoming the decision of the 51st session of the Narcotic Drugs Commission, establishing an open-ended intergovernmental working group to review the financial situation of UNODC and submit recommendations thereof. The Ministers affirmed the importance of the 52nd session of the Commission on Narcotic Drug that will be held in 2009, and its ministerial segment, which will constitute an important stage to follow up on the principles and goals set at the 20th special session of the General Assembly in 1998 with a view to enhance the cooperative efforts to combat the world drug problem in the forthcoming years. Corruption The Ministers stressed that corruption practices, including lack of sound international corporate governance, bribery, money laundering and transfer abroad of illegally acquired funds and assets undermine the economic and political stability and security of societies, undermines social justice and severely endangers the efforts of developing countries for sustainable development. They recognised that the UN Convention against Corruption provides universally accepted norms to prevent and combat corrupt practices, establishes the principle of asset recovery and transfer of assets of illicit origin and mechanism for international cooperation in this regard. Consistent with the aforementioned positions, the Ministers stressed in particular the implementation of the provisions on asset recovery contained in Chapter V of the UN Convention against Corruption, which require States Parties to return assets obtained through corruption. The Ministers emphasized that one of the high priorities in the fight against corruption is to ensure the return of illegally acquired assets to the country of origin. The Ministers, therefore, urged all States Parties and relevant international organizations, consistent with the principles of the Convention, in particular Chapter V, to facilitate the quick return of such assets, and to assist requesting States to build human, legal and institutional capacity to facilitate tracing, confiscation and recovery of such assets. The Ministers, noting the results of the 2nd Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, held in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia, 28 January-1 February 2008, reaffirmed the importance of coordinating positions on these issues, in particular through the promotion of best practices in combating corruption.

Statement on the Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear issue 1. The Ministers reiterated their principled positions on nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation reflected in the Final Document of the Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Putrajaya, Malaysia, 27-30 May 2006 and the 14th Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement held in Havana, Cuba, 11-16 September 2006. The Ministers also reiterated the Movement's principled position on the Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear issue as reflected in the NAM Ministerial Statement adopted in Putrajaya on 30 May 2006 and NAM Heads of State or Government Statement adopted in Havana on 16 September 2006. They considered the positive developments in the implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran as reflected in the reports of the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 2. The Ministers reaffirmed the basic and inalienable right of all states to develop research, production and use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, without any discrimination and in conformity with their respective legal obligations. Therefore, nothing should be interpreted in a way as inhibiting or restricting the right of states to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes. They furthermore reaffirmed that States' choices and decisions, including those of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear technology and its fuel cycle policies must be respected. 3. The Ministers recognized the IAEA as the sole competent authority for verification of the respective safeguards obligations of Member States and stressed that there should be no undue pressure or interference in the Agency's activities, especially its verification process, which would jeopardize the efficiency and credibility of the Agency. 4. The Ministers welcomed the continuing cooperation being extended by the Islamic Republic of Iran to the IAEA including those voluntary CBMs undertaken with a view to resolving all remaining issues, including those as reflected in the latest report of the Director General of the IAEA on 26 May 2008. They welcomed the fact that the IAEA has been able to verify the nondiversion of declared nuclear material in Iran as reflected in the Agency's reports since November 2003 and further noted the assessment of the IAEA Director General in Safeguard Implementation Report (SIR) 2006 that all nuclear material declared by Iran had been accounted for and remains in peaceful activities. They noted at the same time, that the process for drawing a conclusion with regard to the absence of undeclared material and activities in Iran is an ongoing and time consuming process. In this regard, the Ministers further welcomed the modality agreement reached between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IAEA on 21 August 2007 leading to the resolution of the six outstanding issues as a significant step forward towards promoting confidence and a peaceful resolution of the issue. The Ministers took note of the Document INFCIRC/711 in which the Agency and Iran agreed that after the implementation of the Work Plan and the agreed modalities for resolving the outstanding issues, the implementation of safeguards in Iran will be conducted in a routine manner. 5. The Ministers emphasized the fundamental distinction between the legal obligations of states to their respective safeguards agreements and any confidence building measures voluntarily undertaken to resolve difficult issues, and believed that such voluntary undertakings are not legal safeguards obligations. 6. The Ministers considered the establishment of nuclear- weapons-free-zones (NWFZs) as a positive step towards attaining the objective of global nuclear disarmament and reiterated the support for the establishment in the Middle East of a nuclear weapons free zone in accordance with relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. Pending the establishment of such a zone, they demanded Israel to accede unconditionally to the NPT without delay and place promptly all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards in accordance with Security Council Resolution 487 (1981). 7. The Ministers reaffirmed the inviolability of peaceful nuclear activities and that any attack or threat of attack against peaceful nuclear facilities - operational or under construction - poses a great danger to human beings and the environment, and constitutes a grave violation of international law, principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and regulations of the IAEA. They recognized the need for a comprehensive multilaterally negotiated instrument prohibiting attacks, or threat of attacks on nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 8. The Ministers strongly believed that all safeguards and verification issues, including those of Iran, should be resolved within the IAEA framework, and be based on technical and legal grounds. They further emphasized that the Agency should continue its work to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue within its mandate under the Statute of the IAEA. 9. The Ministers stressed that diplomacy and dialogue through peaceful means must continue to find a comprehensive and long term solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. They expressed their conviction that the only way to resolve the issue is to pursue substantive negotiations without any preconditions among all relevant parties. In this regard, the Ministers welcomed Iran's willingness to commence negotiations on various regional and global issues, including nuclear issues with NAM Member States, particularly those of the region. The Ministers further welcomed the talks between Iran and the six countries held in Geneva in July 2008. Statement on Zimbabwe The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Non-Aligned Movement at their 15th Ministerial Conference held in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran (29-30 July 2008) expressed their support for the resolution on Zimbabwe adopted at the 11th Ordinary Session of the African Union Summit on 1 July 2008 at Sharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt, and welcomed current negotiations aimed at resolving the current political impasse. The Ministers encouraged the ongoing inter-party talks and expressed their unequivocal support for the mediation efforts of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) through the facilitation of President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa. The Ministers expressed their deep concern at the imposition and extension of unilateral sanctions on that country and appealed to states and parties concerned to refrain from any action that may negatively impact on the ongoing negotiations. To that end, they called for the immediate lifting of arbitrary and unilateral sanctions on Zimbabwe. Declaration on Palestine The Ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement reviewed the continuing critical situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They considered further approaches and strategies to be undertaken by the Movement to continue strongly supporting the Palestinian people and their leadership and for advancing the revived peace process towards the achievement of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace settlement and the exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to self-determination in their independent and sovereign State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Ministers reaffirmed their adherence to the principled positions adopted in this regard, including in the Declarations on Palestine adopted by the Committee on Palestine on 25 September 2007 in New York as well as on 16 September 2006 in Havana during the XIV Summit Conference of Heads of State or Government, and the clear positions concerning Palestine adopted by all other previous Summits and Ministerial Conferences of the Movement. The Ministers expressed their deep regret that sixty years have passed since the 1948 Al-Nakba that befell the Palestinian people, by which they became a stateless and dispossessed people, dispersed and displaced from their homeland of Palestine, and that more than half of the Palestinian people continue to live in exile in refugee camps throughout the region and in the Diaspora. In this regard, the Ministers called upon all Members of the Movement to solemnly commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Palestinian Al-Nakba this year and to reaffirm their solidarity with the Palestinian people on this occasion and redouble their collective efforts for the just and peaceful resolution of the question of Palestine in all its aspects. The Ministers also expressed their deep regret that since 1967, for more than forty-one years now, the Palestinian people have continuously suffered under Israel's brutal military occupation of their land and that they continue to be denied their fundamental human rights, including the right to self-determination and the right of the Palestine refugees to return. The Ministers expressed their grave concern about the many hardships being endured by the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, as a result of the unlawful policies and practices being carried out by Israel, the occupying Power, including grave human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law. The Ministers expressed their grave concern about the continued deterioration of the ground in the Occupied Palestinian Territory at the political, economic, social, security, and humanitarian levels. The Ministers strongly condemned the continuing Israeli military aggressions against the Palestinian people, particularly in the Gaza Strip, which have resulted, inter alia, in the killing and injury of more Palestinian civilians, including children, by use of excessive and indiscriminate force and extrajudicial executions and the vast destruction of homes, properties, infrastructure and agricultural lands. They called for an immediate cessation of such acts of military aggression by the occupying Power, which constitute grave violations of international law and for which the perpetrators must be held accountable and brought to justice. The Ministers also condemned the continuing illegal detention and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians, including hundreds of women and children and numerous elected officials, and called for their immediate release. The Ministers condemned Israel's continued unlawful imposition of measures of collective punishment on the Palestinian people, including reprisals against the civilian population and restrictions on freedom of movement. They expressed grave concern and strong condemnation in particular of Israel's inhumane closure and siege of the Gaza Strip, which has resulted in the virtual imprisonment of the entire Palestinian civilian population there and the deepening of the economic, social and humanitarian deprivation and crisis due to the occupying Power's obstruction of access to food, medicines, fuel and electricity, building materials and other basic human necessities as well as the obstruction of movement of humanitarian personnel and sick persons requiring medical treatment outside of Gaza. The Ministers stressed that, in addition to violating countless provisions of human rights law, such measures of collective punishment by Israel are tantamount to grave breaches of international humanitarian law, by which it is bound as the occupying Power and with which it must scrupulously comply. The Ministers called for an immediate end to Israel's illegal closure of the Gaza Strip and for the opening of all of the Gaza Strip's border crossings to allow for the movement of persons and goods into and out of the Territory. In this regard, the Ministers reiterated their support for the Palestinian Authority's proposal to assume responsibility for operation of the Palestinian side of the Gaza Strip's border crossings, and called upon the parties to resume the application of internationally-agreed arrangements to ensure their speedy reopening and to ease the isolation and suffering of the civilian population. The Ministers also condemned Israel's imposition of severe restrictions on the movement of persons and goods throughout and into and out of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, via closures and a vast, discriminatory network of hundreds of checkpoints and the Wall and its associated permit regime, which are physically separating Palestinian communities, isolating East Jerusalem, destroying the economy and social fabric, severing the northern, central and southern parts of the Palestinian Territory, and undermining its territorial contiguity, integrity and unity. They expressed alarm that continuation of such illegal measures is jeopardizing the establishment of a sovereign, viable and independent State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, and demanded that Israel, the occupying Power, immediately cease all such measures, which are in grave violation of international law. The Ministers stressed that among such grave breaches by the occupying Power, the primary danger to the realization of the inalienable and national rights of the Palestinian people and the achievement of the two-State solution continued to be the unlawful campaigns of settler colonialism and construction of the Wall being carried out by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They reiterated their strong condemnation of Israel's intensive colonization measures, including vast land confiscations, construction and expansion of settlements, particularly in and around Occupied East Jerusalem, construction of Israeli-only bypass roads, and ongoing attempts to annex the Jordan Valley. The Ministers reaffirmed the many United Nations Security Council resolutions condemning and demanding the cessation of such illegal practices, including measures to change the status, character and demographic composition of East Jerusalem, which are null and void, and they called for the respect and implementation of those resolutions. In this regard, the Ministers also reiterated their condemnation of Israel's continuing construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, in flagrant defiance of international law, the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July 2004 on the "Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" and General Assembly resolution ES-10/15 of 20 July 2004. They expressed deep concern about the grave breaches of international law, including of the Fourth Geneva Convention and of human rights law, that continue to be committed by Israel, including, inter alia, the destruction and requisition of land and properties and the violations of the Palestinian people's freedom of movement as well as their rights to work, to health, to education, to livelihood and to an adequate standard of living. They also expressed grave concern over the extreme physical, economic and social devastation being caused by the Wall, which is dissecting the Palestinian Territory into walled and isolated cantons, destroying entire communities, displacing thousands of Palestinians from their homes and lands, and severing East Jerusalem from the rest of the Territory. They stressed that such illegal, unilateral measures gravely threaten the prospects for achieving the two-State solution on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, and reaffirmed their complete rejection of these Israeli measures and policies. The Ministers reiterated their demand that Israel, the occupying Power, scrupulously respect its obligations as mentioned in the Advisory Opinion and comply with resolution ES-10/15. They recalled in specific the Court's determination: that Israel is under an obligation to terminate its breaches of international law, to cease the construction of the Wall being built in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East Jerusalem, to dismantle the structure therein situated, to repeal and render ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts relating thereto, and to make reparation for all damage caused by the construction of the Wall. The Ministers also reiterated their call upon Member States and the UN to uphold their obligations in accordance with the Advisory Opinion and the demands made in resolution ES-10/15, including the obligation not to recognize the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the Wall and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by such construction. Moreover, in light of Israel's continued intransigence and defiance of international law, the Ministers reiterated their call for further specific actions to bring end to the violations being committed by the occupying Power in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They called for measures to be undertaken by Member States, including by means of legislation, collectively, regionally and individually, to prevent any products of the illegal Israeli settlements from entering their markets, consistent with obligations under international treaties, to decline entry to Israeli settlers and to impose sanctions on companies and entities involved in the construction of the Wall and other illegal colonization activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. They also called upon the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to adhere to Article 1 common to the four Geneva Conventions and to undertake measures to ensure Israel's compliance with the Convention and reaffirmed the obligations of the High Contracting Parties regarding penal sanctions, grave breaches and responsibilities. In this context, the Ministers called for the application of legal remedies to end the human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law being committed by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and to hold it accountable. Furthermore, they reiterated their firm conviction that respect and compliance with international law and UN resolutions and decisions will positively influence the efforts for achieving a just, peaceful, political settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the basis of the rules and principles of international law. The Ministers also recalled in this regard the obligation of the UN, especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, to consider further action to bring an end to the illegal situation resulting from the construction of the Wall. In this regard, they recalled operative paragraph 5 of resolution ES-10/15 and reiterated their call upon the Security Council to adopt a clear resolution and the necessary measures to address the matter. They also welcomed the General Assembly's adoption of resolution ES-10/17 on 15 December 2006, by which it established the United Nations Register of Damage Caused by the Construction of the Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and called for the expeditious operation and speedy fulfillment of its mandate. The Ministers reaffirmed their support for the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and the Palestinian Authority under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas and emphasized the importance of maintaining and protecting the national and democratic institutions of the Palestinian Authority, including the Palestinian Legislative Council, which shall constitute a vital foundation for the future independent Palestinian State. They called for urgent efforts to rehabilitate and develop Palestinian institutions and, in this connection, stressed the need for mobilization of Palestinian capabilities to preserve the territorial unity and integrity of the Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, to end the occupation and to achieve the Palestinian national goal. The Ministers also called for speedy restoration of the situation in the Gaza Strip to that which existed prior to the unlawful events of June 2007 to pave the way for Palestinian dialogue to achieve national reconciliation and unity. In this regard, they expressed support for the Yemeni Initiative and called for its implementation. The Ministers reiterated their hope that the international community and the Quartet will continue to exert serious efforts during the current critical period to advance the peace process and to salvage the Road Map and promote its implementation towards ending the occupation of the Palestinian Territory that began in 1967, including East Jerusalem, and thus realizing the two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the right of all States and peoples in the region to live in peace and security. The Ministers reaffirmed the continued relevance of the Arab Peace Initiative, adopted by the XIV Arab Summit in Beirut in March 2002 and reaffirmed by XIX Arab Summit in Riyadh in March 2007, and welcomed the XX Arab Summit in Damascus in March 2008, which reaffirmed the commitment by all Arab States to the Arab Peace Initiative and stressed that such commitment is subject to adherence by Israel to its obligations under the terms of reference for achieving peace in the region, and called for intensification of efforts in this regard. They called on all concerned parties to remain actively engaged with the Palestinian and Israeli sides to promote substantial negotiations and encourage immediate positive steps on the ground to promote genuine progress in the peace process on all final status issues towards the achievement of its stated aims and goals. In this connection, the Ministers took note of the timely international conferences convened at Annapolis in November 2007 and at Paris in December 2007, aimed at ending the occupation that began in 1967 and actualizing the two-State solution and at providing urgently-needed assistance to the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority, and called for serious and continuous follow-up efforts. In this regard, the Ministers reiterated their support to convening the follow-up Conference before the end of 2008 to take stock of progress achieved in the peace process. The Ministers further reiterated their support to convening this Conference in Moscow. The Ministers also reiterated their call upon the Security Council to assume its responsibilities and to act on the basis of its own resolutions to compel Israel to respect international law and to bring an end to all of its illegal practices and its occupation. The Ministers expressed appreciation to the members of the NAM Caucus of the Security Council for their efforts concerning Palestine and called upon them to continue coordination on the issue and to remain actively involved. Moreover, they urged the Security Council to engage the Quartet, considering the Council's Charter responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. In this context, they reaffirmed the permanent responsibility of the UN towards the question of Palestine until it is resolved in all aspects on the basis of international law, including a just resolution of the plight of the Palestine refugees in accordance with General Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 11 December 1948. The Ministers reaffirmed their conviction that a vital role should continue to be played by the Movement vis-à-vis the question of Palestine and entrusted the Chair, assisted by the Committee on Palestine, to lead the efforts of the Movement with regard to the pursuit of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region. They stressed the importance of active contacts and dialogue by the Movement at the Ministerial level with the members of the Quartet, the members of the Security Council and other relevant parties in the peace process in order to convey the Movement's principled positions and advance efforts aimed at promoting the peace process and at ensuring respect for international law, the keys to a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The Ministers welcomed the holding of the Asian-African Ministerial Conference on Capacity Building for Palestine, in Jakarta 14 July 2008, with the main objective of assisting the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem as well as in clusters of refugee camps in the surrounding host countries, in practical field of capacity building, in order to prepare them for the eventual creation of a Palestinian State. The Ministers highly commended the commitments made in the areas of economic development, including governance, women empowerment and public works, which may entail the training of as many as 10,000 Palestinian people. In this regard, the Ministers also welcomed the follow-up mechanism established to ensure the success of the effective implementation of the commitments as agreed by the Conference. The Ministers also underscored the importance of the work of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society and peace groups, particularly on the Palestinian and Israeli sides, and encouraged them to continue their positive work. In conclusion, in light of the continuing severe economic, social and humanitarian hardships being endured by the Palestinian people as a result of the unlawful policies and measures being carried out by Israel, the occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, the Ministers reiterated the call upon the Non-Aligned countries to continue extending urgent assistance to the Palestinian people to ease their financial and humanitarian crisis. Moreover, the Ministers reaffirmed their long-standing, principled political support, reaffirming their strong commitment to continue supporting the Palestinian people and their leadership to bring an end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967, in accordance with the rules and principles of international law and relevant UN resolutions, and their commitment to a just, peaceful and permanent solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to the right of the Palestinian people to exercise self-determination and sovereignty in their independent State of Palestine, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
