UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL A/52/716Reissued for technical reasons. 11 December 1997 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH Fifty-second session Agenda items 95 (a), 95 (d), 96 (a), 96 (b), 97 (a), 97 (g) and 97 (h) MACROECONOMIC POLICY QUESTIONS: FINANCING OF DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING NET TRANSFER OF RESOURCES BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES EXTERNAL DEBT CRISIS AND DEVELOPMENT SECTORAL POLICY QUESTIONS: INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION: RENEWAL OF THE DIALOGUE ON STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPMENT THROUGH PARTNERSHIP WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT Letter dated 10 December 1997 from the Chairman of the Second Committee to the President of the General Assembly As I have already reported orally to you, the Second Committee finished yesterday the consideration of the agenda items that had been assigned to it by the General Assembly and suspended its work. We had this year, I believe, a highly productive eight-week session which was marked not only by rich intergovernmental debates and the adoption of 30 important resolutions and several decisions, but also by the holding of a series of special events related to topics of particular relevance to our agenda, which included three panel sessions with outside experts, two keynote addresses by academicians, 13 executive briefings by high-level United Nations officials - including the convenors of the new Executive Committees set up in the Secretariat - video-conferences with UNCTAD meetings in Geneva, and a special address by the Secretary-General on the implementation of the recently adopted Agenda for Development. We also continued to try to build on other aspects of Assembly resolution 50/227, particularly with regard to the rationalization and improvement of the methods of work of the Committee and the establishment of links for closer cooperation with other Main Committees, particularly the Third Committee. A/52/716 English Page Delegations attached particular significance to one of the resolutions adopted this year, contained in document A/C.2/52/L.51, which establishes a process for the convening, before the year 2001, of a high-level international intergovernmental forum for consideration of the topic of financing for development, to further the global partnership for development. I share the view that this important decision should greatly promote the cause of international cooperation for development and enhance the crucial role the United Nations is called to play in the consideration of international economic issues. Unfortunately, six of the resolutions dealing with topics on which we regularly work in the Second Committee on the basis of consensus were, notwithstanding many efforts to avoid it, adopted by vote at our last meeting. These were the draft resolutions bearing the numbers A/C.2/52/L.11/Rev.1, L.17/Rev.1, L.40, L.48, L.49 and L.58, all of which had been the object of lengthy consultations coordinated by the two Vice-Chairmen of the Committee and on which basically total agreement had been achieved. It is my feeling and my hope that these resolutions still could - and should - be adopted by consensus by the Plenary of the General Assembly when it considers the reports of the Second Committee just a few days from now. The views and positions of all delegations on references contained in the draft resolutions have now been clearly noted and recorded, and I have no doubt that they will thus be duly taken into consideration in future discussions on these issues. For these reasons, and mindful that the option of entering additional explanations of position or reservations also exists, I feel that all delegations could be in a situation to consider allowing a consensus adoption by the Plenary of the above-mentioned draft resolutions, which would greatly favour the spirit of cooperation we all wish for the work of the United Nations and which has come through in so many other aspects of our proceedings. In the same manner, I would be hopeful that, if a satisfactory outcome is obtained with regard to the above, the General Assembly should also be in a position to consider reintroducing and adopting in the Plenary another important draft resolution we discussed very extensively this year, contained in document A/C.2/52/L.59, on which the Committee yesterday chose not to take action. Even though, as I indicated to the Committee, I remain disposed to help in any way I can in the pursuit of these objectives, I refer these matters to your high office in order that, if you deem it appropriate, you may yourself bring them directly to the attention of Member States. I ask that you have this letter, which I write under my own responsibility, distributed as an official document of the General Assembly, in connection with items 95 (a) and (d), 96 (a) and (b), 97 (a), (g) and (h) of the agenda of the fifty-second session.
