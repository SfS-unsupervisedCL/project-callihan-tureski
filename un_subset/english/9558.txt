UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/1193 23 November 1999 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 22 NOVEMBER 1999 FROM THE CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES A.I. OF THE PERMANENT MISSION OF YUGOSLAVIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL I have been instructed by my Government to lodge the strongest protest over the terrorist attack that took place near Kursumlija, Serbia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on 21 November 1999. Two members of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Serbia were killed and six were wounded in an explosion of a landmine planted by terrorists which the United Nations security presence confirmed had come from Kosovo and Metohija, the autonomous province of the Yugoslav constituent Republic of Serbia. This terrorist act is a dangerous development by which the terrorists strive to project their criminal activities also outside the territory of Kosovo and Metohija and is a glaring example of the failure of the Kosovo Force to carry out its obligation to demilitarize and disarm the terrorists of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army as provided for by Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). The killing and wounding of the members of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Serbia send a clear signal to potential Serbian and other non-Albanian returnees that the Kosovo Force has failed to ensure a secure environment in Kosovo and Metohija and that they should abandon hope of ever returning to their homes. This is the strategy aimed at creating chaos and tension in order to drive out all Serbs and other non-Albanians from this Serbian province and create Greater Albania. The failure of the Kosovo Force and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to prevent these atrocities makes them an accomplice in the furtherance of the nefarious goals of Albanian terrorist separatists in Kosovo and Metohija. In lodging the strongest protest, I demand that a vigorous investigation be conducted to apprehend and punish the perpetrators of this heinous crime. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Vladislav JOVANOVIC Chargé d'affaires a.i.
