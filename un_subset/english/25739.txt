These acts of aggression reaffirm Israel's hostile attitude, and the nature and number of these unjustified and inexcusable violations and acts of aggression confirm Israel's premeditated intention to threaten and provoke and to disrupt security and stability in order to serve its aggressive, expansionist objectives throughout the region. The Mission of Lebanon, in drawing the attention of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the gravity and possible consequences of such acts of aggression, requests to have his letter of complaint circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 37, and of the Security Council.
