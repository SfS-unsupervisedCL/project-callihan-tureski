Luiz Olavo Baptista ("Chairman"), Jean Naudet, and Jianxi Wang as the second Panel of Commissioners (the "Panel") charged with reviewing category "E4" claims. The "E4" population consists of claims, other than oil sector and environmental claims, submitted by Kuwaiti private-sector corporations and other entities eligible to file claims under the Commission's "Claim Forms for Corporations and Other Entities" ("Form E"). The tenth instalment of 141 "E4" claims was submitted to the Panel on 11 February 2000, in accordance with article 32 of the Provisional Rules for Claims Procedure (S/AC.26/1992/10) (the "Rules"). Pursuant to article 38 of the Rules, this report contains the Panel's recommendations to the Governing Council concerning the tenth instalment claims. I. OVERVIEW OF THE TENTH INSTALMENT CLAIMS The 141 tenth instalment claims were selected from the population of approximately 2,750 "E4" claims on the basis of criteria that include, inter alia, the size, volume and complexity of the claims, the legal, factual, and valuation issues raised by the claims, and the date of filing of the claims with the Commission. The tenth instalment claimants filed losses aggregating Kuwaiti dinars ("KWD") 59,797,136 (approximately USD 206,910,505). The claimants have also asserted claims for interest totalling KWD 2,287,847 (approximately USD 7,916,426) and claim preparation costs aggregating KWD 284,569 (approximately USD 984,668). The nature of the legal and factual issues raised in each claim and the amount of documentation provided in support of each claim has allowed the Panel to complete its verification of the claims within 180 days. All of the claimants in the tenth instalment operated in Kuwait prior to Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Most claimants conducted trading operations dealing in a variety of goods. Some claimants were engaged in manufacturing and service industries. Claimants in this instalment have sought compensation for all but two of the loss types identified on Form E. The two loss types for which no losses have been claimed relate to business transactions or courses of dealing and loss of income-producing properties. The two most common losses asserted are loss of tangible property (mainly stock, furniture, fixtures, equipment and vehicles) and loss of earnings or profits. Claimants have also sought compensation for uncollectible receivables, restart costs, interest and claim preparation costs as "other losses". II. THE PROCEEDINGS Before the tenth instalment claims were submitted to the Panel, the secretariat undertook a preliminary assessment of the claims in accordance with the Rules. This review is described in paragraph 11 of the "Report and recommendations made by the Panel of Commissioners concerning the first instalment of `E4' claims" (S/AC.26/1999/4) (the "First `E4' Report"). The results of the review were entered into a centralized database maintained by the secretariat (the "Claims Database"). Originally 11 claims presented formal deficiencies and the secretariat issued notifications to these claimants pursuant to article 15 of the Rules. The claimants corrected all formal deficiencies. A substantive review of the claims was undertaken to identify significant legal, factual and valuation issues. The results of the review, including the significant issues identified, were recorded in the Claims Database. The Executive Secretary of the Commission submitted reports 28 and 29 dated 23 July 1999 and 28 October 1999, respectively, to the Governing Council in accordance with article 16 of the Rules ("article 16 reports"). These reports covered, inter alia, the tenth instalment of "E4" claims and presented the significant legal and factual issues identified in these claims. A number of Governments, including the Government of Iraq, submitted additional information and views in response to the Executive Secretary's article 16 reports. At the conclusion of the (i) preliminary assessment; (ii) substantive review; and (iii) article 16 reporting, the following documents were made available to the Panel: (a) The claim documents submitted by the claimants; (b) The preliminary assessment reports prepared under article 14 of the Rules; (c) Information and views of Governments, including the Government of Iraq, received in response to the article 16 reports; and (d) Other information deemed, under article 32 of the Rules, to be useful to the Panel for its work. For the reasons stated in paragraph 17 of the First "E4" Report, the Panel retained the services of an accounting firm and a loss adjusting firm as expert consultants. The Panel directed the expert consultants to review each claim in the tenth instalment in accordance with the verification and valuation methodology developed by the Panel. The Panel directed the expert consultants to submit to the Panel a detailed report for each claim summarizing the expert consultants' findings. By its procedural order dated 11 February 2000, the Panel gave notice of its intention to complete its review of the tenth instalment claims and submit its report and recommendations to the Governing Council within 180 days of 11 February 2000. This procedural order was transmitted to the Government of Iraq and the Government of Kuwait. Pursuant to article 34 of the Rules, additional information was requested from the claimants in order to assist the Panel in its review of the claims. Claimants who were unable to submit the evidence requested were asked to provide reasons for their inability to comply with such requests. All requests for additional information were directed through the Government of Kuwait's Public Authority for Assessment of Compensation for Damages Resulting from Iraqi Aggression ("PAAC"). The requests for additional information were made in relation to the entire "E4" claims population and not just the tenth instalment claims. The requests for additional information have been described in paragraphs 19-24 of the "Report and recommendations made by the Panel of Commissioners concerning the fourth instalment of `E4' claims" (S/AC.26/1999/18) (the "Fourth `E4' Report") and paragraph 18 of the "Report and recommendations made by the Panel of Commissioners concerning the sixth instalment of `E4' claims" (S/AC.26/2000/8). These requests for information are not restated in this report. An additional level of verification was performed to determine if related claimants filed duplicate claims. This review is described in paragraph 18 of the Fourth "E4" Report. During the Panel's review of claims in this instalment, the secretariat informed the Panel of the potential overlap between some claims in this instalment and certain individual claims for business losses filed before the Commission. This issue has been identified and reported to the Governing Council, in connection with the initial review of business loss claims filed by category "D" claimants, in report no. 30, dated 17 February 2000, submitted by the Executive Secretary of the Commission in accordance with article 16 of the Rules. At the Panel's request, the secretariat conducted a review of the Claims Database and identified fifteen claims in this instalment of "E4" claims, which present a potential for overlap with other individual claims for business losses filed before the Commission. The "E4" claims have been listed in annex III to this report. The Panel considers that additional time is required to determine the nature and extent of the overlap between these "E4" claims and the potentially overlapping individual claims for business losses. At this stage, to allow time for the additional claim development and review required, the Panel has recommended that the claims listed in annex III to this report be deferred to a later instalment of category "E4" claims. Therefore, the Panel has made no findings concerning the claims listed in annex III to this report. Subsequent references in this report to tenth instalment claims are references to the remaining 126 claims listed in annex I. Based on its review of the documents submitted and the additional information obtained, the Panel concluded that the issues presented by the tenth instalment claims had been adequately developed and that oral proceedings were not required to explore such issues further. III. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND VERIFICATION AND VALUATION METHODOLOGY The legal framework and the verification and valuation methodology applied to the evaluation of claims in this instalment is the same as that used in earlier "E4" instalments. This framework and methodology are discussed in paragraphs 25-62 of the First "E4" Report. Subsequent "E4" reports discuss additional legal and verification and valuation issues that were encountered in later instalments of "E4" claims. These various elements of the Panel's review are not restated in this report. Instead this report refers to sections in the previous "E4" reports where such issues have been addressed. Where the Panel encountered new issues not addressed in prior "E4" reports, the Panel developed methodologies for verifying and valuing the losses. These new issues are discussed in the text of this report. The Panel's specific recommendations on the losses asserted in this instalment and the reasons therefore are set out in the annexes to this report. Before discussing the Panel's specific recommendations for compensating the tenth instalment claims, it is important to restate that the Panel's approach to the verification and valuation of these claims balances the claimant's inability always to provide best evidence against the "risk of overstatement" introduced by shortcomings in evidence. In this context, the term "risk of overstatement", defined in paragraph 34 of the First "E4" Report, is used to refer to cases in which claims contain evidentiary shortcomings that prevent their precise quantification and therefore present a risk that they might be overstated. THE CLAIMS The Panel reviewed the claims according to the nature and type of loss identified. Therefore, the Panel's recommendations are set out by loss type. Reclassified losses have been dealt with in the section pertaining to the loss category into which the Panel reclassified the losses. Contract Six claimants in this instalment asserted claims aggregating KWD 1,587,618 (approximately USD 5,493,488) for loss of contract. The claims for loss of contract in this instalment did not raise any new legal or verification and valuation issues. The Panel's approach to the compensability of contract losses is stated in prior "E4" reports and the verification and valuation methodology adopted by the Panel for the loss of contract claims is discussed in paragraphs 77-84 of the First "E4" Report. The Panel's recommendations with respect to contract losses are set out in annex II. B. Real property Thirty-four claimants in this instalment asserted claims aggregating KWD 2,829,194 (approximately USD 9,789,599) for loss of real property. These claims related to damage to a number of owned and rented premises in Kuwait. The claims for loss of real property in this instalment did not raise any new legal or verification and valuation issues. The compensability standards and the verification and valuation methodology adopted by the Panel for loss of real property claims are stated in paragraphs 89101 of the First "E4" Report. The nature of damage to the properties and the location of the affected properties in Kuwait established that the losses were a direct result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Claims were either based on the actual costs incurred in repairing the properties or on estimates of such costs. Most claimants submitted sufficient evidence to establish their interest in the affected properties and the loss claimed. However, as was the case in earlier "E4" instalments, claimants generally did not exclude regular maintenance or depreciation costs from their claims. The Panel adjusted the claims to account for these costs, which would have been incurred in the normal course of business and were not a direct result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Similar adjustments were made by the Panel in cases of unforced "betterment", as explained in paragraph 97 of the First "E4" Report. In claims based on estimated repair costs, the Panel sought a reasonable explanation for the claimant's failure to repair or replace the affected property. Where such explanation was absent, the Panel adjusted the claim to offset the "risk of overstatement" created by this shortcoming. The Panel's recommendations on real property losses are summarized in annex II. C. Tangible property, stock, cash and vehicles Tangible property losses are claimed by a majority of the tenth instalment claimants. The asserted losses, relating to stock, furniture and fixtures, equipment, vehicles and cash, aggregate KWD 29,497,597 (approximately USD 102,067,810). With regard to the compensability and the verification and valuation of these tangible property claims, the Panel applied the approach set out in paragraphs 108-135 of the First "E4" Report. The claimants in this instalment generally submitted the same type of evidence encountered by the Panel in earlier "E4" instalments in relation to claims for loss of tangible property and stock. (See "Report and recommendation made by the Panel of Commissioners concerning the second instalment of `E4' claims" (S/AC.26/1999/17) (the "Second `E4' Report") at paras. 55-64.) A majority of the claimants seeking compensation for cash losses sought to rely on witness statements from related parties without providing further evidence to substantiate their claims. Where claims for cash losses were not supported by contemporaneous evidence establishing the possession and amount of cash held on 2 August 1990, the Panel recommended no compensation. Most claimants with loss of vehicle claims were able to establish their losses by submitting copies of deregistration certificates and additional documents such as post-liberation audited accounts and witness statements that substantiated the fact and circumstances of their losses. The asserted values of the vehicles lost were separately verified by the Panel against vehicle values contained in the Motor Vehicle Valuation Table ("M.V.V. Table"), as defined at paragraph 135 of the First "E4" Report, or, for vehicles not listed in the M.V.V. Table, against other third-party estimates. The Panel's recommendations on tangible property, stock, cash and vehicle losses are summarized in annex II. D. Payment or relief to others Eight claimants in this instalment submitted claims aggregating KWD 1,185,321 (approximately USD 4,101,457) for payment or relief to others. When reviewing claims for payment or relief to others the Panel applied the approach and verification and valuation methodology described in earlier "E4" reports. (See, e.g., Fourth "E4" Report at paras. 61-63.) Rumaithiya Cooperative Society states that it disposed "of part of its stock either by selling or supplying at no cost to some families who had no money." After the liberation of Kuwait the claimant continued distributing foodstuffs free of charge. This is supported by the post-liberation extraordinary loss provision in the claimant's audited accounts, which shows that food was given away free or distributed to citizens. Likewise, Al Sha'ab Cooperative Society granted "the citizens of [the] Al-Sha'ab area a social aid in the form [of] cash amounts as a relief payment[ ] due to the financial hardship resulting from the suspension of their income resources since the invasion took place." The Panel followed the same approach taken in the Second "E4" Report (para. 71) and the Fourth "E4" Report (para. 60.) and recommended no compensation for these claimants. The Panel's recommendations on the payment or relief to others claims are summarized in annex II. E. Loss of profits Approximately 72 per cent of the claimants in this instalment submitted claims for loss of profits aggregating KWD 12,631,653 (approximately USD 43,708,142). Four significant legal and factual issues raised in the first instalment claims are all raised in the tenth instalment claims. These issues relate to the impact and assessment of (i) benefits received under the Government of Kuwait's post-liberation debt settlement programme, (ii) windfall or exceptional profits earned by claimants in the period immediately following the liberation of Kuwait, (iii) the indemnity period for loss of profits claims, and (iv) claims for loss of profits selectively based on profitable lines of business. The conclusions reached by the Panel in relation to these issues are set forth in paragraphs 161-193 of the First "E4" Report. The Panel has applied these conclusions in its considerations and recommendations for the loss of profits claims in this instalment. The verification and valuation methodology adopted by the Panel for loss of profits claims is stated in paragraphs 194-202 of the First "E4" Report. Despite several requests, some claimants in the tenth instalment did not provide annual accounts for the three fiscal years prior to and following the end of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. The Panel noted that, in some cases, the failure to submit some accounts was sufficiently explained, for example, where the claimant had commenced trading in the period between 1987 and 1990 or where the claimant had ceased trading following Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Loss of profits claims by businesses that failed to provide a full set of annual audited accounts for the relevant periods were regarded as presenting a "risk of overstatement", unless the failure to submit the accounts was sufficiently explained. The Panel's recommendations on loss of profits claims are summarized in annex II. F. Receivables Twelve claimants in this instalment asserted claims for uncollectible receivables or "bad debts" aggregating KWD 3,488,752 (approximately USD 12,071,806). A majority of these claims were for amounts owed by businesses or individuals located in Kuwait prior to Iraq's invasion. As was the case in previous instalments of "E4" claims, most claimants sought compensation for debts that remained uncollected because debtors had not returned to Kuwait after liberation. The issue raised is whether the uncollected debts had become uncollectible as a direct result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. The Panel reiterates its determination on this issue as set out in paragraphs 209-210 of the First "E4" Report. Claims for debts that have become uncollectible as a result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait must demonstrate, by documentary or other appropriate evidence, the nature and amount of debt in question and the circumstances that caused the debt to become uncollectible. The tenth instalment claims for uncollectible receivables were verified and valued in the manner described in paragraphs 211-215 of the First "E4" Report. As discussed above, the Panel recommends no award for claims that rely on the mere assertion that uncollected debts are ipso facto uncollectible because the debtors did not return to Kuwait. Nearly all of the claimants failed to provide evidence to demonstrate that their debtors' inability to pay was a direct result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. This shortcoming was brought to the attention of the claimants, in the context of the additional information requested from claimants (see para. 17 above). While a number of responses were received from claimants, none satisfied the above criteria. The Panel's recommendations on "bad debt" claims are summarized in annex II. G. Restart costs Thirteen claimants in this instalment asserted claims aggregating KWD 324,175 (approximately USD 1,121,713) for restart costs. The amounts claimed as restart costs have been reviewed using the methodology discussed in paragraphs 221-223 of the First "E4" Report and paragraphs 9396 of the Second "E4" Report. (See also, Fourth "E4" Report, paras. 8789.) Shams Physiotherapy Centres Co. K.S.C. Closed seeks compensation for non-incremental salary, rent, subscription and other expenses. Likewise Kuwait Precast Systems Co. seeks compensation for non-incremental salaries and expenses. As noted in the First "E4" Report (see para. 223), claimants must establish that such restart payments are "extraordinary payments incurred as a direct result of Iraq's invasion and occupation." As the claimant has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that these costs were incremental costs, the Panel recommends no compensation for these claims. The Panel's recommendations on restart costs are summarized in annex II. H. Other losses A few claimants have sought compensation for losses suffered as a result of their receipt of cancelled Kuwaiti dinar currency notes. These notes were received by claimants who continued to operate during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. The Panel recommends compensation for these claims for the reasons stated in paragraphs 98-99 of the Second "E4" Report. In relation to claims for losses incurred when claimants were forced to accept Iraqi dinars for products sold during Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, at an exchange rate such as one Iraqi dinar to one Kuwaiti dinar, the Panel applied its recommendations stated in paragraphs 100-102 of the Second "E4" Report. Claims for "other losses" that have been dealt with in prior "E4" instalments were reviewed in the manner stated in earlier "E4" reports. (See, e.g., Second "E4" Report at para. 108 and Fourth "E4" Report at para. 103 dealing with the treatment of prepaid expenses.) Industrial Investments Company K.S.C. seeks compensation for a loss on the sale of Kuwaiti dinars during the occupation. In its statement of claim, it avers that as a result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait it was forced to sell Kuwaiti dinars for United States dollars in order to meet payments "toward committed investments and operating expenses". The claimant provided a schedule of the exchange rate in 1990, which demonstrated that the rate was increasingly favourable up to the date of the invasion. The claimant also provided some support for its cash requirements in order to substantiate the need to exchange the Kuwaiti dinars. The claimant exchanged the Kuwaiti dinars on 27 November 1990 at a rate of 0.333 USD for 1 KWD. The claimant states that the rate on the date of the invasion was 0.28749. In the Third "E4" Report, paras. 50-52, the Panel recommended compensation for the incremental and extraordinary cost of a claimant's early redemption of bonds during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. These bonds were designated in Kuwaiti dinars, but because the currency was withdrawn from circulation at the time of the redemption, the redemption was in United States dollars. Likewise, the Panel recommends an award for this claimant after adjusting the claim to the approved exchange rate and for the risk of overstatement ordinarily associated with currency conversion. Al Ahli Club of Kuwait for Tourism & Automobile Services W.L.L. entered into agreements with Jordanian and Egyptian customs authorities that allowed the claimant's clients to enter those countries with their cars maintaining their Kuwaiti license plates. The claimant was obliged to issue bank guarantees in favour of the customs authorities for penalties or fines incurred by the claimant's clients who stayed longer than permitted or who disposed of their vehicles improperly. The claimant states that as a result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait, many clients sold their cars illegally in order to raise money, and as a consequence, the claimant was required to pay these customs guarantees. The Panel recommends awarding a portion of this claim for customs commitments after reducing the claim to the amount of the extraordinary loss provision in the December 1991 audited accounts and for the risk that not all of the sales occurred as a direct result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. (See, e.g., Second "E4" Report, para. 104, recommended recovery of customs deposits with an adjustment made for the "risk of overstatement.") International Shipping Agency Limited incurred costs to establish a temporary office in Dubai during Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. The Panel found such expenses to be incremental costs incurred as a direct result of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. The claimant provided debit notes to support the payment of rent from 15 August 1990 through 30 April 1991; however, the claimant did not provide sufficient proof of payment for the remaining expenses. The Panel recommends an award for the amount of the claim supported by sufficient proof of payment. Al Ahlia Hotel Supplies Co. W.L.L. asserts a claim for the "loss of customers' goods." The claimant states that it held goods at its warehouse that had already been purchased by its clients. These goods were destroyed during Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Pursuant to a court order, the claimant states it had to reimburse its clients. Only one court order was provided, but it concerned goods that were purchased on 29 December 1984. Further, insufficient evidence was provided to demonstrate that the claimant reimbursed its clients. For these reasons, the Panel recommends no compensation for the claim. The Panel's recommendations on other losses are summarized in annex II. V. OTHER ISSUES A. Applicable dates for currency exchange rate and interest In relation to the applicable dates for currency exchange rate and interest, the Panel has adopted the approach discussed in paragraphs 226233 of the First "E4" Report. B. Claim preparation costs The Panel has been informed by the Executive Secretary of the Commission that the Governing Council intends to resolve the issue of claim preparation costs in the future. Accordingly, the Panel has made no recommendation with respect to compensation for claim preparation costs. VI. RECOMMENDED AWARDS Based on the foregoing, the awards recommended by the Panel for claimants in the tenth instalment of "E4" claims are set out in annex I to this report. The underlying principles behind the Panel's recommendations on claims in this instalment are summarized in annex II to this report. All sums have been rounded to the nearest KWD and therefore the amounts may vary from the amount stated on Form E by 1 KWD.
