Sixty-first session Special Political and Decolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) Agenda item 33 Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects Letter dated 1 November 2006 from the Permanent Representative of Japan to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Committee I write to clarify Japan's position with regard to the statement made by the delegate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea during the general debate on agenda item 33, "Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects", in the Fourth Committee on 25 October 2006, since we refrained from exercising the right of reply in order to avoid the discussion of issues irrelevant to the agenda. It is regrettable that the delegate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea referred to so-called issues of the past, which are not relevant to the current discussion. The recognition of the Government of Japan concerning issues of the past is as articulated in the Japan-Democratic People's Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration, the statement by former Prime Minister Koizumi at the Asian-African Summit in 2005 and his statement of 15 August 2005. Since its accession to the United Nations in 1956, Japan, as a responsible Member State, has continuously contributed to the efforts for international peace and security and has worked to enhance and strengthen security in the East Asian region as well as at the international level. Issues of the past between Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea belong to a category totally separate from the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse by international peacekeepers which the Fourth Committee must address. Statements by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that are without relevance to the agenda diminish and hinder sincere discussion by Member States in the Committee dedicated to developing United Nations peacekeeping operations. At this opportunity, I would like to reassure you of Japan's commitment to contributing to the development of United Nations peacekeeping operations through constructive discussion in the Fourth Committee. I should be grateful if you could arrange for the present letter to be circulated as a document of the Fourth Committee, under item 33. (Signed) Kenzo Oshima Ambassador Permanent Representative
