Fifty-sixth session Agenda item 37 The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict Letter dated 18 October 2001 from the Permanent Representative of South Africa to the United Nations addressed to the SecretaryGeneral I have the honour to transmit herewith the provisional report of the Kimberley Process. You may recall that paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 55/56 of 1 December 2000 requests the countries participating in the Kimberley Process to present to the Assembly, no later than its fifty-sixth session, a report on progress made. Participants of the Kimberley Process are currently engaged in a process to come up with a simple and workable international certification scheme for rough diamonds. In this regard, two more plenary meetings and a ministerial session of the Kimberley Process are scheduled for later this year. Please be informed that a comprehensive progress report will be forwarded to your office at the end of the year. I have the honour to enclose herewith a provisional report of the Kimberley Process for your consideration in an attempt to keep the General Assembly informed of developments so far achieved. (Signed) Dumisani S. Kumalo Ambassador Permanent Representative Provisional report of the Kimberley Process to the General Assembly, submitted in pursuance of Assembly resolution 55/56 of 1 December 2000
