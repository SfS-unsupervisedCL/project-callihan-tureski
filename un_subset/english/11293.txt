Fifty-fifth session Agenda item 15 (a) Elections to fill vacancies in principal organs: Election of five non-permanent members of the Security Council Letter dated 11 October 2000 from the Permanent Representative of the Sudan to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly The delegation of the Sudan would like to express its sincere thanks and esteem for your admirable efforts to ensure that the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council proceeded impartially and honestly, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure. The delegation of the Sudan, like the delegations of a number of other States, observed a tendency to activity on the part of the delegation of the United States while the States Members of the United Nations were voting by secret ballot; indeed, the representative of the United States went in person among the representatives of Member States to influence them at their seats during the balloting. The delegation of the Sudan drew the attention of the Secretariat to this, and the Secretariat has now advised us of the action taken, quite rightly, by the President of the General Assembly in personally asking the representative of the United States to desist from his activity and to sit down at his place during the balloting. The delegation of the Sudan would be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly under agenda item 15 (a). (Signed) Elfatih Erwa Permanent Representative
