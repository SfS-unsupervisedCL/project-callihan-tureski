Item 1 Under this item, the Executive Board will adopt the agenda for the annual session 2013 and agree on the workplan for the session as presented by the Secretary of the Board. The Board may wish to approve the report of its first regular session 2013. A draft report was distributed to members of the Board for their comments; the final report contains comments received within the deadline. Documentation: Provisional agenda, annotations, list of documents and workplan (DP/2013/L.2) Report of the first regular session 2013 (DP/2013/9) Decisions adopted at the first regular session 2013 (DP/2013/10) Item 2 Annual report of the Administrator In line with Executive Board decision 2012/9, the cumulative review and the annual report of the Administrator on the strategic plan, 2008-2013, provides a high-level, multi-year analysis of achievements under the current strategic plan, and identifies challenges and lessons learned on the basis of performance. It provides an overview of development and institutional results, including UNDP contributions and lessons learned across the four output dimensions, the four focus areas of the strategic plan, and the cross-cutting and development effectiveness areas of work. The report also includes an annex with the annual report on the remaining seven strategic plan outcomes subject to in-depth reporting. The Board may wish to take note of the report and provide guidance relevant to the preparations of the next strategic plan. In line with General Assembly resolutions 59/267 and 62/246, the UNDP report on the recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) provides a summary of UNDP management responses to the recommendations contained in the reports issued by the JIU in 2012, as well as the implementation status of relevant JIU recommendations issued in 2010 and 2011. The Board may wish to take note of the report. The statistical annex contains detailed financial information on the annual stock of income and expenditures for UNDP country programme activities and for the funds and trust funds administered by UNDP. Cumulative review of the strategic plan and annual report of the Administrator: performance and results for 2012 (DP/2013/11) Report of UNDP on the recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit in 2012 (DP/2013/11/Add.1) Statistical annex (DP/2013/11/Add.2) Item 3 UNDP strategic plan, 2014-2017 The draft UNDP strategic plan, 2014-2017, has been prepared within the framework of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review and the outcomes of United Nations international conferences. It is the product of discussions with the Exeutive Board, United Nations agencies, independent experts and UNDP staff. The draft plan states that the world is undergoing an unprecedented transition where the eradication of extreme poverty has become possible. It proposes that UNDP commit to a vision that focuses on this potential breakthrough: the simultaneous eradication of extreme poverty and reduction of inequalities and exclusion using a sustainable human development approach. The draft plan, including its annexes, sets out the results and actions, targeting both development and institutional issues, together with the improved partnerships and coordination, needed to deliver on this vision. Draft strategic plan, 2014-2017 (DP/2013/12) Item 4 Funding commitments In line with Executive Board decision 98/23 and building on the approach taken in that context, the Board will have before it a report on the status of regular funding commitments for 2013 and onwards and a summary of the provisional income for regular and other resources received in 2012.

The HDRO Director will describe the key findings of the 2013 Human Development Report, `The Rise of the South: Human Progress in a Diverse World'; the global reception of the report; and the tentatively planned stakeholder conversations in the context of a second Global Human Development Forum, likely to take place in late May. The Director will briefly summarize the 2014 Human Development Report theme and outline the development process for the report, with particular attention to strengthened dialogue with Member States, including on statistical aspects of the report. He will also highlight recent HDRO dialogues with global experts on the human development measurements. Item 6 UNDP country programmes and related matters The final report on the UNDP global programme, 2009-2013, requested by the Executive Board in its decisions 2008/32 and 2011/18, assesses the progress achieved by UNDP multi-practice policy advisory services, including progress towards the Millennium Development Goals; preparations for the `Rio+20' Conference on Sustainable Development; and advancing the local development and local governance agenda. The report notes that the global programme has been successful linking the global and local, influencing global policy discourse and bringing policy services closer to national counterparts and country offices. The Executive Board may wish to take note of the final report and suggest strengthening policy advisory services for the next global programme. Under this item, the Executive Board will also be asked to: (a) take note of the first one-year extensions of the country programmes for Afghanistan, Angola, Kenya and Venezuela for a period of one year, from 1 January to 31 December 2014; (b) approve the second one-year extensions of the country programmes for Guinea-Bissau and Mali, from 1 January to 31 December 2014; the exceptional third-year extensions of the country programmes for Madagascar, Tunisia and Paraguay, from 1 January to 31 December 2014; the two-year extension of the country programme for Côte d'Ivoire, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015; and the two-and-half-year extension of the country programme for South Sudan, from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2016; (c) comment, prior to their finalization, on the draft country programme documents for Benin, Burundi, Republic of the Congo, Niger, Nigeria, Togo; Bhutan (common country programme) and Cuba; and (d) in accordance with decisions 2012/17 and 2013/6, review and approve, on an exceptional basis, the draft common country programme document for Rwanda and the draft country programme document for Egypt, respectively.

The report presents key findings and lessons learned from evaluations conducted in 2012 and sets out the programmes of work for 2013 and 2014. The Executive Board may wish to adopt a decision, elements of which are contained in the report. The evaluation of the UNDP strategic plan, 2008-2013, was part of the Evaluation Office programme of work for 2012, approved by the Executive Board. It is an independent evaluation of (a) UNDP performance during the first five years of the strategic plan in relation to the strategic intent as expressed in the strategic plan goals, and (b) UNDP use of the strategic plan to strengthen the management of the UNDP contribution to development results. The evaluation of the UNDP fourth global programme was requested by the Executive Board and included in the 2011 Evaluation Office workplan. The evaluation assesses the progress achieved by UNDP multi-practice policy advisory services, including progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, preparations for the `Rio+20' Conference on Sustainable Development, and advancing the local development and local governance agenda. Assessed against programme objectives, the report considers the extent to which the global programme has been successful in influencing the global policy discourse on development issues, and in bringing policy services closer to UNDP national counterparts and country offices. UNDP regional programmes are designed to enhance the coherence of UNDP technical support and to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience across the countries served in each region. As part of its programme of work for 2012-2013, the Evaluation Office launched evaluations of each of the five regional programmes, for Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Arab States, Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The evaluations cover the period 2008-2013, and respond to the results and resources frameworks developed for each regional programme. They examine programme relevance and results achieved, including the quality of technical support services provided by the regional centres to country offices and other national or regional partners. The evaluations were carried out using a combination of desk reviews, field visits, interviews with stakeholders, and a survey of country offices. The independent evaluation of the UNDP contribution to South-South and triangular cooperation was conducted by the Evaluation Office in 2012. The evaluation reviewed performance during the period 2008-2011, examining it through the lenses of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. It focused particularly on UNDP support to the achievement of development results through South-South and triangular cooperation and on clarifying the added value and comparative advantage of UNDP in that regard. The evaluation was conducted against the UNDP strategic plan, 2008-2013, and the fourth cooperation framework for South-South cooperation (DP/CF/SSC/4). The scope of the evaluation mirrored the strategic plan vision of mainstreaming South-South approaches throughout UNDP focus areas at the global, regional and country levels, and of facilitating South-South and triangular cooperation initiatives within and across the five regions in which the organization operates. The evaluations will be accompanied by UNDP management responses. The Executive Board may wish to take note of the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the evaluations and of the management responses. Annual report on evaluation (DP/2013/16) Evaluation of the UNDP strategic plan, 2008-2013 (DP/2013/17) Management response to the evaluation of the UNDP strategic plan, 2008-2013 (DP/2013/18) Evaluation of the UNDP global programme (DP/2013/19) Management response to the evaluation of the UNDP global programme (DP/2013/20) Evaluation of the regional programme for Africa (DP/2013/21) Management response to the evaluation of the regional programme for Africa (DP/2013/22) Evaluation of the regional programme for Asia and the Pacific (DP/2013/23) Management response to the evaluation of the regional programme for Asia and the Pacific (DP/2013/24) Evaluation of the regional programme for the Arab States (DP/2013/25) Management response to the evaluation of the regional programme for the Arab States (DP/2013/26) Evaluation of the regional programme for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (DP/2013/27) Management response to the evaluation of the regional programme for Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (DP/2013/28) Evaluation of the regional programme for Latin America and the Caribbean (DP/2013/29) Management response to the evaluation of the regional programme for Latin America and the Caribbean (DP/2013/30) Evaluation of UNDP contribution to South-South and triangular cooperation (DP/2013/31) Management response to the evaluation of UNDP contribution to South-South and triangular cooperation (DP/2013/32) Item 8 United Nations Capital Development Fund The annual session of the Executive Board is an opportunity for Member States to be briefed by the Executive Secretary on UNCDF results for 2012 and perspectives for the future. The annual report of UNCDF documents and analyses performance against established targets in terms of programme, management and financial results. In 2012, donor development partners confirmed a strong demand for the products and services of UNCDF, giving rise to a number of major new initiatives and partnerships with public- and private-sector donors. Non-core contributions increased to new record levels (300% growth since 2006), while delivery levels remained high. Over the year, the UNCDF practice areas - inclusive finance and local development finance - made significant progress in improving the quality and results of their interventions in contributing to poverty alleviation in the least developed countries. The stakeholder consultations on the future of UNCDF, mandated by the Executive Board in its decision 2012/12, commenced in late 2012 and made apparent that the expertise, flexible financial investment mandate and geographic focus of UNCDF will remain relevant in the post-2015 development framework. They also stressed the alarming imbalance between the limited core resources of UNCDF and its fast growing non-core resources. As forewarned in earlier Executive Board sessions, the low levels of core resources will force UNCDF - beginning in 2013 - to reduce its technical presence and programming in a number of least developed countries. Addressing the unsustainable and apparently contradictory nature of this situation is the top priority of management and deserves the full attention of the Executive Board. In this context, an informal report with findings from the stakeholder consultation process will be presented to the Board at its annual session 2013. Report on results achieved by UNCDF in 2012 (DP/2013/33) Item 9 United Nations Volunteers In accordance with Executive Board decision 2012/13, the Board will have before it a report on the evolution of the role and function of the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme since its inception. It is presented with an analysis of the three main phases in UNV history, including the principal milestones, from start-up to the present time. This will contribute to an understanding of how UNV is situated today in terms of volunteerism and people-centered development, and will provide a solid basis for determining strategic directions for the next four years and beyond, including in relation to the need to deliver clearly articulated results. The Executive Board may wish to adopt a decision, elements of which are contained in the report, including requesting UNV to present to the Board a strategic framework for the period 2014-2017. Report of the Administrator on the evolution of the role and function of the United Nations Volunteers programme since its inception (DP/2013/34) Item 18 Programming arrangements In response to Executive Board decision 2013/4, the present document addresses the inclusion of UNCDF in the programming arrangements, with a focus on their implications on core resources available for programming within the context of the integrated budget, as well as the rationale for making this an annual expenditure. The document provides information on the performance of the functions financed under the following lines in the programming arrangements framework: the office of development studies, development support services, economists' programme, and policy advisory services. The Board may wish to take note of the proposed approach for the inclusion of UNCDF in the programming arrangements, as well as of the information presented on the performance of functions financed under the above-mentioned lines in the programming arrangements framework. Proposal to include UNCDF in the programming arrangements (decision 2013/4) (DP/2013/37) Item 10 Annual report of the Executive Director Under this item, the Executive Board will have before it the annual report of the Executive Director for 2012.
