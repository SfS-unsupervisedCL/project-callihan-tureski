"This agreement is the outcome of all the initiatives taken by the Libyan Leader in this dispute, particularly the Tripoli Agreement, and the meeting in Banjul between Presidents Idriss Déby Itno and Omer Al-Bashir in conjunction with the African Union summit, followed by the visit of the Chadian Minister for Foreign Affairs and African Integration to Khartoum and the visit of his Sudanese counterpart to Chad approved by a memorandum concerning the willingness of the two countries to make peace at their borders. "The presence of the Sudanese Head of State at the inauguration ceremony this morning reflects this willingness to resume fraternal relations between the Sudan and Chad. "All the Heads of State present at this mini-summit were eager to praise the tireless efforts made by the Leader of the Libyan Revolution since the beginning of the dispute, which have resulted today in this fraternal agreement between the Sudan and Chad.
