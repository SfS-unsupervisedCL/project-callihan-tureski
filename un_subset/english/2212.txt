The peace-loving people of Kyrgyzstan and its Government are deeply concerned at the hostilities taking place in the friendly Islamic State of Afghanistan, which have brought untold misfortune to women, children and old people and the civilian population in general and senseless losses of human lives to the opposing military formations. Kyrgyzstan, which is historically committed to the principles of tolerance and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States, is deeply convinced: the long-standing inter-Afghan confrontation can be ended through peaceful political dialogue at the negotiating table. In supporting the main idea of the appeal of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Askar A. Akayev, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the heads of State and Government whose countries are members of the Secretary-General's "group of friends of Afghanistan" and the leaders of the opposing sides in Afghanistan, which contained the sincere proposal to hold in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan's capital, a peace conference on Afghanistan under the United Nations auspices, we believe that the interested parties from the States that have expressed their desire to take part in such a conference will be able to speak freely and make constructive proposals on all fundamental aspects of a solution of the Afghan question, bearing in mind their understanding of the problem and guided by the common goal of restoring long-awaited peace and tranquillity in unfortunate Afghanistan. In giving the United Nations the key role in organizing and convening the aforementioned conference, we hope that, in seeking to find ways of breaking the deadlock in the Afghan crisis, representatives of the Afghan sides and interested States will participate at the highest official level and on a multilateral basis. Deeply aware of the complexity of the search for peaceful means - there is no alternative - of settling the conflict in Afghanistan, we, the deputies of the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic, trusting in the eternal truth of the triumph of Good, believe: the conflict will finally be settled and the unity of the will and spirit of all of us parliamentarians of the world can guarantee such an outcome. The Legislative Assembly and the Assembly of People's Representatives appeal to all the parliaments and parliamentarians of the planet to support the convening and holding in Bishkek of a conference of international representatives on a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan and to participate actively with a view to contributing to its success. Let peace and prosperity come to the land of Afghanistan. Adopted at a joint meeting of the Legislative Assembly and the Assembly of People's Representatives of the Zhogorku Kenesh (Parliament) of the Kyrgyz Republic.
