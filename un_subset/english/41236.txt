The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102, requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies. On the current issue of compilation of special procedures' recommendations by country, a comprehensive annual report (E/CN.4/2006/99) was submitted to the sixty-second session of the Commission pursuant to resolution 2004/76. The information in the report remains relevant. The Office of the High Commissioner understands decision 2/102 to preserve the previous annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by the Council. The present report accordingly addresses developments in the compilation of special procedures' recommendations over the last year. 2. In paragraph 10 (c) of resolution 2004/76, the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to continue to prepare a comprehensive and regularly updated electronic compilation of special procedures' recommendations by country, where such does not yet exist, including the relevant comments of States thereto as published within the United Nations system. 3. The compilation is available on the website of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (www.ohchr.org). 4. In paragraph 12 (a) of the same resolution, the Commission requested the SecretaryGeneral to issue annually and sufficiently early, in close collaboration with the special procedures, their conclusions and recommendations, so as to enable further discussion of their implementation at subsequent sessions of the Commission. 5. In view of United Nations rules prohibiting the republication of material that has already been issued for general distribution, it has been decided to compile in the annex to this report the references to the pertinent paragraphs containing the conclusions and recommendations in the annual reports submitted by special procedures to the Human Rights Council at its fourth session.
