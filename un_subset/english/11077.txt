Fifty-fifth session Request for the inclusion of a supplementary item in the agenda of the fifty-fifth session Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations peacekeeping operations Letter dated 28 June 2000 from the Permanent Representative of Chile to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General In accordance with rule 14 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, I am hereby requesting the inclusion, in the agenda of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, of a supplementary item entitled "Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations peacekeeping operations". Since this is a financial matter, we believe that it should be considered in the context of the work of the Fifth Committee. Pursuant to rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, this request has been accompanied by an explanatory memorandum (see annex). (Signed) Juan Gabriel Vald√©s Ambassador Permanent Representative Explanatory memorandum The growing importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations, the increase in the volume of resources needed to carry them out effectively, the precariousness of their financial situation and the need to institutionalize the methodology for calculating each country's financial contributions warrant the inclusion of the item "Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations peacekeeping operations" in the agenda of the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Our country, as a manifestation of its commitment to the protection of the universal values set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, and aware of its responsibility for contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security, has striven to increase significantly its participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. Currently, members of the Chilean armed forces and police force are serving in the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH), the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). In this context, it may be emphasized that, last year, we commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of uninterrupted participation in peacekeeping operations. Accordingly, the Government of Chile, with a view to providing the greatest possible support to global peacekeeping, has amended its legislation to facilitate the contribution of human and material resources from our armed forces and police force. As a result, last year Chile signed a memorandum of understanding on stand-by arrangements, contributing troops whose importance stems from the technical quality of their personnel and equipment, and seeking thereby to reduce the needs of the current inventory of the United Nations stand-by arrangements system. In view of the foregoing, which reflects our sustained commitment to the peacekeeping operations of this Organization, we consider it important to continue to make every effort to ensure that these activities are adequately financed. To this end, we reiterate the need to institutionalize the methodology for determining the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
