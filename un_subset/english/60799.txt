Letter dated 26 July 2011 from the Charg√© d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Serbia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council Upon the instruction of my Government, I have the honour to request an urgent meeting of the Security Council for Thursday, 28 July 2011, devoted to the serious deterioration of the security situation in the northern part of Kosovo, following violent attempts by the special forces of the Kosovo police to change the situation on the ground. The attempts to take over the administrative border points Brnjak and Jarinje pose a serious threat to the ongoing dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina and threaten an even worse escalation of the situation. I have also the honour to request that, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and rule 37 of the provisional rules of procedure of the Security Council, a representative of the Government of Serbia be allowed to participate in the meeting and to make a statement. (Signed) Milan Milanovic Ambassador Deputy Permanent Representative
