The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General dated 23 August 2004 (A/59/290) and amounted to $85,333,400 gross ($79,423,000 net), exclusive of budgeted voluntary contributions in kind amounting to $60,000. It provided for an average of 42 military liaison officers, 424 contingent personnel, 157 civilian police, 244 international and 559 national staff and 110 United Nations Volunteers. 2. On the basis of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in paragraph 43 of its report of 27 September 2004 (A/59/384), the General Assembly, by its resolution 59/13 A of 29 October 2004, appropriated the amount of $85,153,700 gross ($79,391,700 net) for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2004 to 20 May 2005 and the commencement of the liquidation activities of the Mission for the period from 21 May to 30 June 2005, inclusive of the amount of $30,485,600 gross ($28,399,200 net) previously authorized by the Assembly under the terms of its resolution 58/260 B of 18 June 2004 for the period from 1 July to 31 October 2004. The full amount was assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance 3. The mandate of UNMISET was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1410 (2002) and was adjusted and extended in subsequent resolutions, the last of which was resolution 1573 (2004), by which the Council extended the mandate of UNMISET for a final period of six months, until 20 May 2005. 4. The Mission was mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to advance the long-term stability and security of Timor-Leste. 5. Within this overall objective, the Mission has, during the performance report period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below. Those frameworks are grouped by three programmes of the mandate implementation plan described in the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council dated 29 April 2004 (S/2004/333, paras. 23-58 and annexes I, II and III), namely, public administration and justice system of Timor-Leste and justice in the area of serious crimes; development of law enforcement in Timor-Leste; and security and stability of Timor-Leste; as well as a support component. 6. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based frameworks set out in the 2004/05 budget. In particular, the performance report compares the actual indicators of achievement, that is, the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement and compares the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs. Expected accomplishment 1.1: Sustainable institutional capacity of Timor-Leste core State institutions, including Parliament, offices of the President and the Prime Minister, key State ministries and

Reconciled and closed 5 major contracts and 350 purchase orders Contracts 1 contract for freight forwarding services remained in effect through 31 December 2005 Lower output of purchase orders is

Applicable to home country Incremental transportation factor IV. Analysis of variances 7. The variance of $127,300 under this heading is attributable primarily to increased requirements for the repatriation of military observers owing to the discontinuation for safety reasons of travel arrangements with a regional commercial carrier operating a route to Darwin (Australia), from where connecting flights to final destinations were being booked. Travel arrangements with the only available alternative carrier proved to be less economical, resulting in the average one-way airfare costing $4,262 compared to the budgeted $1,800. 8. The additional requirements of $1,804,500 under this heading are attributable to increased expenditure for the rotation and repatriation travel of military contingent personnel and the expenditure recorded in the reporting period with respect to the deployment of one contingent in June 2004. 9. The variance of $90,900 under this heading is attributable to the increased cost of one-way airfare ($5,360 compared to the budgeted $1,800) owing to the discontinuation for safety reasons of travel arrangements with a regional commercial carrier and the use of the only available alternative carrier. 10. The unspent balance of $2,403,100 under this heading is attributable primarily to the higher actual international staff vacancy rate during the reporting period (23.4 per cent compared to 15 per cent applied in the budget), offset in part by additional expenditure under common staff costs related to travel on separation and reassignment of staff and commutation of annual leave at the completion of the mandate of the Mission. 11. The variance of $356,000 under this heading is attributable to the increased cost of one-way airfare owing to the discontinuation for safety reasons of travel arrangements with a regional commercial carrier and the use of the only available alternative carrier, offset in part by the higher actual average vacancy rate of United Nations Volunteers during the reporting period (16.4 per cent compared to 10 per cent applied in the budget). 12. The unutilized balance of $373,200 under this heading is attributable primarily to the average vacancy rate for civilian advisers of 10.3 per cent during the reporting period, while provisions made in the budget were based on the full incumbency of 58 positions. 13. The variance of $74,100 under this heading is attributable to the non-utilization of budgeted consultancy services and the cancellation of training courses for which provisions were made in the budget. 14. The additional requirements of $9,300 under this heading are attributable to increased expenditures for official travel in connection with the mission assessment and establishment of a follow-on United Nations presence in Timor-Leste upon the expiration of the mandate of UNMISET, the review of the contract for the provision of rations to military contingents, the travel of a security team (weapons training) and administrative support in connection with the Mission's liquidation. The increased requirements under official travel were offset in part by lower expenditure on training-related travel owing to the reprioritization of requirements and cancellation of information technology, engineering, supply and inventory management courses. 15. The variance of $640,700 under this heading is attributable primarily to (a) reduced requirements for the acquisition and installation of shatter-resistant film, reinforced security barriers and vehicle barricades, maintenance services and supplies, security services, generator spare parts and supplies (owing to the relocation of Mission personnel to fewer facilities); and (b) the lower actual cost of the refurbishment of premises handed over to the Government of Timor-Leste, the cancellation of a sewage treatment plant and transformer installation engineering projects and the utilization of existing stocks of stationery, office and maintenance supplies, offset in part by a 25 per cent increase in the cost of generator fuel ($0.50 per litre compared to the budgeted $0.40) and acquisition of water pumps upon handover of the main water supply points to the Government of Timor-Leste. 16. The unspent balance of $325,800 under this heading is attributable primarily to reduced requirements for spare parts owing to the cannibalization of vehicles which had reached the end of their useful economic life and were not suitable for transfer to other missions or donation. 17. The variance of $954,000 under this heading is attributable primarily to reduced requirements with respect to air transportation services owing to the waiver of most service fees for the use of Comoro Airport granted by the Government of Timor-Leste, the utilization of fewer flight hours by the Mission's helicopter fleet (1,659 actual compared to 2,932 planned) and the resulting lower consumption of aviation fuel. The reduced requirements were offset in part by additional expenditure with respect to the rental and operation of fixed-wing aircraft owing to the utilization of a higher number of flight hours than planned (1,954 actual compared to 1,130 planned). 18. The unutilized balance of $428,200 under this heading is attributable primarily to reduced requirements for spare parts owing to the cannibalization of various items of communications equipment written off at the end of their useful economic life and to lower actual expenditure with respect to commercial communications owing to the reduced Mission share of the global transponder lease charges. 19. The variance of $164,600 under this heading is attributable primarily to reduced requirements with respect to information technology services owing to the Mission's reduced share of the global manufacturer's support contract for software and equipment used in peacekeeping missions, offset in part by the acquisition of digital scanners for the archiving of serious crimes witness statements and the acquisition of five replacement laptop computers. 20. The additional requirements of $75,600 under this heading are attributable to the unplanned acquisition of surgical and sterilization equipment for the military medical surgery and trauma team and medical supplies for one of the contingents. 21. The variance of $687,500 under this heading is attributable primarily to (a) the cancellation of a requirement for mine detection and clearing services owing to the absence of mine-contaminated areas in Timor-Leste and the clearing of unexploded ordnance from target ranges by military contingents; and (b) the lower actual cost of general insurance and freight to the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, as fewer items of equipment were shipped to the Base, offset in part by the higher cost to lease photocopiers than was provided for in the budget. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 22. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNMISET are: (a) To decide that Member States shall waive their respective shares in other income for the period ended 30 June 2005 amounting to $13,171,400, and their respective shares in the amount of $870,500 from the unencumbered balance of $3,604,500 for the period ended 30 June 2005, to be applied to meeting the current and future after-service health insurance liabilities of the United Nations; (b) To decide on the treatment of the remaining unencumbered balance of $2,734,000 for the period ended 30 June 2005.
