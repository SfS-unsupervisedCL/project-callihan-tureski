Note verbale dated 31 January 2011 from the Permanent Mission of Singapore to the United Nations addressed to the Secretariat The Permanent Mission of Singapore to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Secretariat and has the honour to refer to the Secretary-General's note C.N.474.2009.TREATIES-3 dated 30 July 2009, which informed the States parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (the Single Convention) of the Economic and Social Council's decision to initiate the procedures under article 47, paragraph 1 (b), of the Single Convention, regarding the proposal to amend the Single Convention as communicated in the Secretary-General's note C.N.474.2009.TREATIES-2 dated 6 April 2009. Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs, and pursues a comprehensive national strategy to combat the scourge of drugs comprising a high-profile public education campaign; treatment and rehabilitation of drug offenders; as well as strict laws and stiff penalties against those involved in the drug trade. Singapore regards the Single Convention as a fundamental component of our national anti-drugs policy as it, inter alia, facilitates the taking of effective measures against abuse of narcotic drugs through coordinated and universal action. The Single Convention's multipronged approach has proven effective over time and Singapore does not see any benefit in making amendments which weaken it. The Permanent Mission of Singapore to the United Nations hereby informs the United Nations that the Government of Singapore does not accept the proposed amendment to the Single Convention.
