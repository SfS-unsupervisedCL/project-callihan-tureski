CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT ENGLISH Original: RUSSIAN LETTER DATED 18 JULY 2007 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE of THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION TO THE CONFERENCE ON DISARMAMENT ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE CONFERENCE TRANSMITTING A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA REGARDING A DECREE ON SUSPENSION OF THE VALIDITY OF THE TREATY ON CONVENTIONAL ARMED FORCES IN EUROPE AND RELATED INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AS FAR AS THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS CONCERNED, SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, MR. V.V. PUTIN, ON 13 JULY 2007 I have the honour to transmit to you the text of a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation in connection with a decree on suspension of the validity of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and related international treaties as far as the Russian Federation is concerned, signed by the President of the Russian Federation, V.V. Putin, on 13 July 2007. I would be grateful if you could issue and circulate this letter with the attached statement as an official document of the Conference on Disarmament. (Signed): Valery LOSHCHININ Ambassador, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the Conference on Disarmament On 13 July 2007 the President of the Russian Federation signed a decree suspending the validity of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and related international treaties as far as the Russian Federation is concerned. Both chambers of the Federal Assembly have been informed of this decision, and an appropriate bill is being introduced in the State Duma. The period during which the validity of these international treaties will be suspended in respect of the Russian Federation will begin 150 days after receipt of Russia's notifications of suspension by the treaty depositaries and the States parties to the CFE Treaty. On the instructions of President V.V. Putin, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia will transmit the notifications on 14 July 2007. Practical consequences will include a temporary halt to the provision of information and the hosting and conduct of inspections. During the suspension Russia will not be bound by any limits on conventional arms. But actual quantities of Russian military equipment will depend on the evolution of the military and political situation, including the readiness of other States parties to the CFE Treaty to show adequate restraint. The decision on suspension has no precedents in Russia's recent history. This alone makes it understandable that taking this decision was not an easy matter, and followed a thorough and comprehensive analysis. This step was due to exceptional circumstances pertaining to the content of the CFE Treaty which affect the security of the Russian Federation and require the adoption of immediate measures. The CFE Treaty in its present form is hopelessly outdated. Suffice it to say that it was signed in 1990 and is based on the existence of two opposed military/political alliances - NATO and the Warsaw Treaty Organization. The Warsaw Treaty Organization has since ceased to exist. The same is true of the Soviet Union. And former allies of the USSR have jointed NATO. The 1990 CFE Treaty does not take all these changes into account. The limits on the quantities of Russian weapons in different parts of our territory have also lost all sense. Today they stand in the way of more effective efforts to combat international terrorism. In 1999 the Agreement on Adaptation of the CFE Treaty was signed at our initiative. To a certain extent, it rectified the distortions that had arisen. But the Western partners, using farfetched pretexts, have for more than seven years now prevented this Agreement from entering into force. Moreover, as a result of NATO enlargement, the countries of the alliance, taken together, have exceeded the limits on numbers of arms imposed on the military/political alliance by the old CFE Treaty. This is particularly glaring in the so-called flank area, incorporating northern and southern Europe. A number of new NATO members have still not joined the CFE Treaty at all. We warned the CFE parties long ago that this situation did not meet Russia's security interests and could not continue indefinitely. But we have not yet met with a constructive response to our legitimate concerns and the concrete proposals we have made to rectify the situation. The Russian moratorium does not mean that we are shutting the door to further dialogue. If the issues we have raised are resolved, collective implementation of the Treaty's provisions can be ensured fairly quickly. Our proposals on measures to restore the viability of the CFE regime remain on the negotiating table, and the President of the Russian Federation has given the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other appropriate federal agencies instructions to track the reaction of the States parties to the CFE Treaty and report on developments in the situation, presenting appropriate proposals if necessary. It is on this basis that decisions will be made on further steps to be taken by Russia with regard to the CFE Treaty. Moscow, 14 July 2007
