Table 25.2 Post resources Number Level Regular budget Approved for the biennium 2012-2013 1 USG, 1 ASG Proposed for the biennium 2014-2015 25.1 The overall objective of the programme is to ensure international protection to refugees and others of concern to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and to seek permanent solutions to their problems in cooperation with States and other organizations, including through the provision of humanitarian assistance. 25.2 The mandate for the programme is contained in General Assembly resolution 319 A (IV), by which the Assembly established UNHCR as from 1 January 1951, and resolution 428 (V), which sets out the statute of the Office. The Assembly has also called upon the High Commissioner to ensure that refugees returning voluntarily to their countries of origin ("returnees") receive assistance to help in their sustainable reintegration, as well as to monitor their safety and well-being upon return. UNHCR has also been mandated to address the situation of stateless persons in accordance with the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons (1954) and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness (1961). In addition, on the basis of specific requests from the Secretary-General or the competent principal organs of the United Nations and with the consent of the State concerned, UNHCR provides humanitarian assistance and protection to internally displaced persons, working in cooperation with the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator. In its work for internally displaced persons and as part of the collaborative response of the United Nations system to internal displacement, UNHCR has been given special lead or co-lead responsibility for the following three cluster areas: protection, emergency shelter and camp management/coordination. Addressing the protection needs of these various categories of persons "of concern" to UNHCR, although some may not or may no longer be refugees, also forms an integral part of the programme. 25.3 With regard to the assistance activities of UNHCR, the basic provisions of its statute were built upon by the General Assembly in its resolution 832 (IX). Through the adoption by the Assembly of its resolution 58/153 on implementing actions proposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to strengthen the capacity of his Office to carry out its mandate, UNHCR was given a renewed mandate to address the challenge of forced displacement through a mission based on a spirit of solidarity, responsibility and burden-sharing, with an abiding commitment to make the Office a truly multilateral institution. 25.4 The international legal basis for the protection of refugees finds its principal expression in the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. There are a number of regional instruments of relevance, such as the Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa of the Organization of African Unity (now the African Union), the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, adopted by the Colloquium on the International Protection of Refugees in Central America, Mexico and Panama and the San Jos√© Declaration on Refugees and Displaced Persons. The 2009 African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa sets out a regional legal regime regarding internally displaced persons. The international legal basis for addressing the situation of stateless persons stems from the 1954 and 1961 Conventions. In addition, other international human rights instruments, such as the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, are relevant in providing international protection to refugees, stateless persons, internally displaced persons, returnees and others of concern. 25.5 The overall strategy for the period 2014-2015 will cover a range of activities to be undertaken in cooperation with States and various organizations. It will be guided by the UNHCR global strategic priorities and incorporate concerted responses to the challenges it met in the previous biennium, including an increasingly urban-based population of concern, the growing complexity of the asylum-migration nexus. It will also be guided by pledges to improve the protection of refugees and stateless persons by the 155 States that participated in the 2011 intergovernmental ministerial-level event commemorating the anniversaries of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness (1961). 25.6 Notable among the activities to be implemented for the period 2014-2015 are the following: (a) Pursuing comprehensive strategies, in cooperation with States and organizations, for achieving durable solutions for refugees and others of concern, notably through voluntary return, and, where appropriate and feasible, through local integration and resettlement, while promoting effective protection in displacement; (b) Strengthening the legal regime for international protection, including through the promotion of accessions to international and regional instruments relating to the status of refugees or otherwise benefiting refugees, the effective implementation of refugee rights and the promotion and dissemination of refugee law and protection principles; (c) Enhancing and reinforcing host country capacities to provide asylum and protection; (d) Ensuring that UNHCR fully participates in and supports the strengthened collaborative response of the United Nations to situations of internal displacement, consistent with the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, through its leadership and coordination of areas for which the Office has been given special responsibility under the "cluster approach": protection, emergency shelter and camp management/coordination; (e) Further developing contingency planning, emergency preparedness and response capabilities, in coordination with other organizations, so as to respond effectively and efficiently to situations of forced displacement; (f) Promoting gender equality and ensuring that UNHCR and its partners mainstream into all aspects of programme delivery full consideration of the rights of persons of concern, as well as the particular needs and capacities, ascertained through participatory assessments, of refugee women and children, elderly refugees, refugees with disabilities and other persons with specific needs; (g) Further developing options to ensure the security of refugee camps, settlements and areas of return, as well as their civilian and humanitarian character, and exploring further concrete ways of enhancing the safety and security of UNHCR staff and other humanitarian workers working with refugees and returnees. In this regard, due consideration should be given to the obligation of United Nations officials to observe fully both the laws and regulations of Member States and their duties and responsibilities to the Organization; (h) Systematically following up on relevant recommendations in the plans of action emanating from recent international conferences, especially the plan of action related to the Millennium Development Goals, and involving other humanitarian and development organizations, both national and international, in the provision of assistance to refugees, returnees, stateless persons, internally displaced persons and host communities, as well as in the search for durable solutions; (i) Advocating for the prevention and reduction of statelessness as well as the protection of stateless persons by promoting the accession by States to the relevant international instruments and working with States to facilitate the acquisition, reacquisition or confirmation of nationality of stateless persons. 25.7 The programme is under the intergovernmental guidance of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in accordance with its terms of reference, as adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 1166 (XII). Pursuant to the request of the Assembly in that resolution, the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 672 (XXV), established the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme, which came into existence on 1 January 1959. Reaffirming the terms of reference laid down by the General Assembly, the Council decided that the Executive Committee, being entrusted with the terms of reference set forth in General Assembly resolution 1166 (XII), should: (a) determine the general policies under which the High Commissioner should plan, develop and administer the programmes and projects required to help solve the problems referred to in its resolution 1166 (XII); (b) review at least annually the use of funds made available to the High Commissioner and the programmes and projects being proposed or carried out by the Office of the High Commissioner; and (c) have authority to make changes in and give final approval for the use of funds and the programmes and projects referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. In subsequent resolutions, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Executive Committee of the Programme of the High Commissioner have called upon the Office, in the context of its basic mandate, to assist other groups of persons regarded as falling under the competence of the High Commissioner. Although established by the Economic and Social Council, which elects its members, the Executive Committee functions as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly and is the key governing body of UNHCR. The annual cycle of meetings of the Executive Committee consists of one annual plenary session and a number of intersessional meetings of the Standing Committee. Reports on the sessions of the Executive Committee are submitted to the General Assembly as addenda to the reports of the High Commissioner. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/134 on the enlargement of the Executive Committee, the membership of the Committee may be increased from 85 to 87 States. 25.8 The High Commissioner, who is elected by the General Assembly on the nomination of the Secretary-General, provides the overall direction, supervision and management of the activities under this programme. The functions of the High Commissioner are set out in the annex to the statute of UNHCR. The High Commissioner is assisted by a Deputy High Commissioner and by two Assistant High Commissioners, for Protection and for Operations, respectively. 25.9 The UNHCR New York Office represents the interests of UNHCR and promotes its objectives at Headquarters and with all New York-based United Nations entities, funds, programmes, specialized agencies, diplomatic missions, the press corps accredited to the United Nations and key non-governmental organizations and policy foundations that are accredited to the United Nations or focused on the Organization's political issues. The New York Office is funded entirely from extrabudgetary resources and consists of seven staff members in the Professional and higher categories and five in the General Service category. 25.10 The overall resources proposed for the biennium 2014-2015 for this section amount to $89,773,700 before recosting, reflecting a net decrease of $2,669,400 (or 2.9 per cent) compared with the 2012-2013 budget at revised rates. This decrease results from resource changes in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248. 25.11 The distribution of resources is summarized in tables 25.3 to 25.5.

The primary areas of reductions and related impact are outlined in table 25.6 below. Primary areas of resource changes in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248 Reductions in inputs Description Reductions in the volume of outputs Reductions in performance targets Reduction: Grant towards UNHCR management and administrative costs Reduction of the grant towards UNHCR management and administrative costs. Total net reduction: $2,669,400 The reduction of $2,669,400 in regular budget resources to UNHCR will result in a funding gap, requiring a further appeal to donors for unearmarked voluntary contributions, in support of the delivery of protection and assistance to the persons of concern to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In paragraph 49 of its resolution 58/270, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to it at its fifty-ninth session a proposal for the progressive implementation of article 20 of the statute of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with a view to its full implementation, e.g., all management and administrative costs to be covered by the regular budget of the United Nations. The Secretary-General provided the required report (A/59/294), recommending the continuation of a gradual increase in the contribution of the United Nations towards the management and administrative costs of the Office. The Secretary-General suggested that the proposals for increases be submitted to the General Assembly for its review in the context of future proposed programme budgets. In paragraph 2, section III, of its resolution 59/276, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to include in the programme budget proposals for progressive increases for contributions from the regular budget to the Office of the High Commissioner with a view to the full implementation of article 20 of the statute, while recognizing that the percentage referred to in paragraph 6 of the report of the Secretary-General did not represent a ceiling (e.g., not to consider 50.8 per cent of total management and administrative as a ceiling to be funded through the regular budget). The reduction of $2,669,400 will bring the share of regular budget contributions towards UNHCR management and administrative costs to 38.3 per cent. Extrabudgetary resources 25.13 It is estimated that an amount of $8,088,806,300 be available in extrabudgetary resources for 2014-2015, reflecting an increase of $1,403,700 or 0.1 per cent over the revised estimate for 2012-2013 amounting to $8,087,402,700. The revised extrabudgetary requirements are based on UNHCR comprehensive needs assessment, a planning methodology introduced in 2010, which has been endorsed by its Executive Committee (see A/AC.96/1087) and is the basis for its fundraising efforts to meet the needs of the Organization. 25.14 During the biennium 2012-2013, the Policy Development and Evaluation Service will continue to focus its activities on issues and operations that are of particular interest to UNHCR and the Executive Committee. The Service will also continue efforts to strengthen and integrate the policy development and evaluation functions, to ensure the effective dissemination and utilization of evaluation findings and recommendations, and to promote the principles of transparency and accountability within the Office. All resources identified for those activities are extrabudgetary and are estimated at $1,941,400 for the biennium, including $1,477,600 for the costs of six posts (1 D-1, 1 P-5, 3 P-4 and 1 General Service (Other level)) and $463,500 for non-post resources. 25.15 It is anticipated that recurrent and non-recurrent publications will be issued, as summarized in table 25.7 and as described under "Outputs" (see para. 25.19 below). There is no change in planned activities under these outputs. UNHCR will continue to publish population statistics on refugees and others of concern in its Statistical Yearbook pursuant to the responsibilities set out in its statute, while non-recurrent publications will contribute to policy development and public awareness around priority protection themes and developments in the situation of refugees and others of concern. Table 25.7 Summary of publications 2010-2011 actual Print Electronic Print and electronic Recurrent Non-recurrent 25.16 Effective operational and strategic partnerships will remain a priority for the Office, as a means of enhancing protection, increasing efficiency and strengthening local capacities for response. The Office will further enhance its Implementing Partnership framework and promote implementation of its programmes through partners, with special emphasis on supporting national partners. It will also reinforce its information management, coordination and support capacities to facilitate a more predictable and accountable inter-agency engagement. 25.17 The implementation of the programme falls under the overall responsibility of the regional bureaux of UNHCR; the Division of International Protection; the Division of Programme Support and Management; the Division of Emergency, Security and Supply; and the Division of Financial and Administrative Management. In pursuing expected accomplishments for 2014-2015, the Office will strive to improve accountability, financial and programme control as well as risk management. The Office will continue to mainstream the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) reforms across its operations and systematically promote innovation in programme design, delivery and management. The programme will be implemented in accordance with the strategy as detailed under programme 21 of the biennial programme plan for the period 2014-2015.

uncertain impact of the financial and economic crisis in the developing world, where four out of every five refugees and an even higher proportion of other displaced populations are found; (b) the shrinking humanitarian space surrounding UNHCR operations, brought about by the changing nature of conflict, hardening of the attitude of some Governments towards State sovereignty and increasing confusion of the civilian and military spheres; (c) the increasing insecurity of conditions in which the organization and its partners are obliged to work; (d) the narrowing of asylum space, especially, but not exclusively in the world's most prosperous countries, with an increase in restrictive admission and asylum policies towards refugees and asylum seekers; (e) ensuring the engagement of development actors in securing durable solutions for those of concern, and in addressing the challenges faced by refugees and other displaced persons who move to urban areas; (f) continued availability of predictable, flexible and early extrabudgetary resources which fund 98 per cent of the programme of UNHCR; and (g) the inherent unpredictability of situations requiring a humanitarian response within UNHCR responsibility, despite efforts to improve early warning and emergency preparedness.

Table 25.9 Resource requirements Resources (thousands of United States dollars) Posts (before recosting) Post Non-post 25.21 In accordance with article 20 of the UNHCR statute, no expenditure other than administrative expenditures relating to the functioning of UNHCR shall be borne by the regular budget of the United Nations, and all other expenditures relating to the activities of the High Commissioner shall be financed by voluntary contributions. While the statute does not define what is meant by "administrative expenditures", the term, based on a definition offered by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in a report submitted to the General Assembly at its seventh session (see A/2157, part III), has been interpreted to mean expenses other than operational expenses and the related management costs. 25.22 The amount of $89,773,700 proposed for the biennium 2014-2015 relates to: (a) provision for posts of the High Commissioner and the Deputy High Commissioner ($1,348,200); and (b) a grant to be utilized for the administrative costs of UNHCR ($88,425,500). The decrease in the grant, amounting to $2,669,400, shows that the changes are in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248, as reflected in table 25.6 above. 25.23 The provision of funds to UNHCR for the administrative expenditures of the Office of the High Commissioner in the form of a grant rather than as post and non-post resources was initiated in the biennium 2002-2003. It was designed to simplify the UNHCR budgetary process and would be subject to review after three bienniums, as indicated in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (A/56/6 (Sect. 23), para. 23.20). Accordingly, the review of the lump-sum arrangement and the lessons learned from the full three bienniums, namely, 2002-2003, 2004-2005 and 2006-2007, were reported to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session in 2008 (see A/63/537). The Assembly, in section VII of its resolution 63/263, endorsed the maintenance of the lump-sum arrangement for funding of UNHCR in future budget presentations of the proposed programme budget, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/63/616, para. 10). Organizational structure and post distribution for the biennium 2014-2015 a Posts financed by the grant from the regular budget, shown under the regular budget heading, are for indicative purposes. Outputs included in the biennium 2012-2013 not to be delivered in 2014-2015 A/66/6 (Sect. 25), paragraph Output Quantity Reason for discontinuation 25.22 (a) (i) Report of the Secretary-General on the status of internally displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia and the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia, Georgia While UNHCR anticipates that the Secretary-General may continue to require UNHCR assistance in the preparation of his report on the status of internally displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia and the Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia, Georgia, the legislative mandate for the 2014 and 2015 reports has not been established at the time of the regular budget submission. 25.22 (a) (ii) Preparation for, and servicing of, informal preparatory consultations of the Executive Committee For the biennium 2012-2013, the output was meant to include negotiation of conclusions and decisions of the Executive Committee. During 2012, it proved to be impractical to report separately on the numerous and continuing negotiations, as they result in conclusions and decisions of the Executive Committee which are reported on under other outputs.
