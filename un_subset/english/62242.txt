Sixty-seventh session Agenda item 8 General debate Letter dated 3 October 2012 from the Permanent Representative of Paraguay to the United Nations addressed to the President of the General Assembly I have the honour to enclose a statement by the delegation of Paraguay in exercise of the right of reply to the remarks by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay, Luis Almagro, on Saturday, 29 September 2012 during the general debate of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh regular session (see annex). I should be grateful if this note and the enclosed statement could be circulated to all Members as a document of the General Assembly under agenda item 8. (Signed) Jos√© Antonio Dos Santos Ambassador Permanent Representative New York, 3 October 2012 Paraguay rejects in toto the statements by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Uruguay referring to Paraguay as being violations of the purposes and principles of the United Nations regarding equality of rights and self-determination of peoples, sovereign equality of all Members and non-intervention in internal affairs. Paraguay, as a landlocked developing country, and thus a member of one of the vulnerable groups recognized by the United Nations, wishes to recall the situation of exclusion to which it has been subjected in the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR) and Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), integration mechanisms of which it is a founding State party, in that it has been suspended, in its absence, by means of illegitimate, unlawful, and hence arbitrary decisions. The countries concerned have taken vitally important decisions in open violation of international treaties. At the hemispheric level, the report of the Mission to Paraguay from 1-3 July 2012 of the Secretary-General of Organization of American States (OAS), Jose Miguel Insulza, and a delegation serves to confirm the situation of absolute normality and respect for the rule of law prevailing in Paraguay. On that basis, no sanctions were imposed on Paraguay by the Organization, which has approved the Electoral Observer Mission for the April 2013 general elections. This situation undoubtedly reflects the fact that constitutional processes have been respected in Paraguay, which categorically rejects any reference to a breakdown of constitutional order. Paraguay deplores the fact that the Foreign Minister of Uruguay has without any justification called Paraguayan democracy in question, while ignoring the serious violations of democracy and human rights in other countries of the region.
