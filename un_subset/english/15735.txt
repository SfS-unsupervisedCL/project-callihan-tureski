Annan Letter dated 1 June 2001 from the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency addressed to the SecretaryGeneral I should be grateful if you would arrange to transmit the enclosed letter to the President of the Security Council. (Signed) Mohamed ElBaradei Letter dated 1 June 2001 from the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency addressed to the President of the Security Council In paragraph 8 of resolution 1284 (1999), the Security Council requested that revision and updating of the list of items and technology to which the export/import mechanism, approved by the Council in resolution 1051 (1996), applies be resumed. As indicated in paragraph 9 of resolution 1051 (1996), the annexes to the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification approved under resolution 715 (1991) identify the items and technologies to be notified under the export/import mechanism. With respect to nuclear matters, that document is annex 3 to the Agency's ongoing monitoring and verification plan, as approved in resolution 715 (1991), and subsequently revised and reissued in documents S/1995/215 and Corr.1 and 2. As provided for in paragraph 9 of resolution 1051 (1996), the lists of items and technology to which the export/import mechanism applies may be amended in accordance with the ongoing monitoring and verification plans. Paragraph 41 of the Agency's plan (S/22872 and Corr.1) reads as follows: "The plan may only be revised by the Security Council. The IAEA may, however, after informing the Security Council, update and revise the Annexes in light of information and experience gained in the course of the implementation of resolutions 687 and 707 and of the plan. The IAEA shall inform Iraq of any such change." Paragraph 19 of resolution 1330 (2000) requested that the revision of the list of items and technology be forwarded to the Council "by the end of this period", this period being taken to mean that described in paragraph 1 of the same resolution as "180 days beginning at 00.01 hours, Eastern Standard Time, on 6 December 2000", i.e., by 4 June 2001. Accordingly, as provided for in paragraph 41 of the Agency's plan, paragraph 9 of resolution 1051 (1996), paragraph 8 of resolution 1284 (1999) and paragraph 19 of resolution 1330 (2000), IAEA wishes to inform the Security Council that annex 3 to the IAEA plan, which reflects the list of nuclear and nuclear-related items and technology to which the export/import mechanism applies, will be amended as reflected in the attachment to the present letter and that the Iraqi authorities will be so informed. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council.
