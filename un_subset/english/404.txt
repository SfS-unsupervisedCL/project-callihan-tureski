(Signed) Enrique PAGUAGA FERNÁNDEZ Ambassador Permanent Representative English Page ANNEX Letter dated 10 November 1997 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua addressed to the Secretary-General I should like to refer to the report of 11 September 1997 (A/52/344) which you submitted during the current session under agenda item 45, "The situation in Central America: procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development", and, in particular, to its paragraph 16. In this connection, I should like to offer the following clarifications of some of the issues referred to in that paragraph: (a) The Republic of Nicaragua and the Republic of Honduras delimited the frontier between them in the Gulf of Fonseca in 1900 and are currently uniting their efforts to mark the frontier by means of buoys; (b) Nicaragua's rights in the Gulf of Fonseca outside the zone delimited with Honduras have not yet been determined; (c) Nicaragua has not concluded any agreement to share fishing rights in the Gulf of Fonseca. I trust that the above information can be taken into account for the preparation of a clarification of the statements made in your report.
