Sixty-sixth session Agenda items 146 and 149 Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations Financing of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire Budget performance for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 and proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions Total resources approved for 2010/11a Expenditure for 2010/11 Unencumbered balance for 2010/11 Appropriation for 2011/12 Projected expenditure 2011/12b Estimated unencumbered balance for 2011/12b Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2012/13 Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2012/13 a Inclusive of General Assembly appropriation of $485,078,200 and commitment authority of $85,257,300 approved by the Advisory Committee on 28 April 2011. b Estimates as at 31 March 2012. 1. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in paragraphs 29, 31, 40, 50 and 59 below would entail reductions of $7,343,003 to the proposed budget for the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 (A/66/753). The Committee has made recommendations and observations, where appropriate, in the paragraphs below. 2. The report of the Advisory Committee on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping is contained in document A/66/718. In the present report, the Committee deals with resources and other items that relate specifically to UNOCI. 3. In considering the budget performance report of UNOCI for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 (A/66/616), the Advisory Committee has taken into account the recommendations of the Board of Auditors (see A/66/5 (Vol. II), chap. II). In addition, the report of the Advisory Committee on the Board's report on the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the financial period ended 30 June 2011 is contained in document A/66/719. The Advisory Committee continues to stress the value of the Board of Auditors' findings and reiterates the need for the implementation of its recommendations within the time frames specified by the Secretary-General. 4. The documents reviewed and those used for background by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the financing of UNOCI are listed at the end of the present report. II. Budget performance report for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 5. The Advisory Committee recalls that the General Assembly, in its resolution 64/273, appropriated an amount of $485,078,200 gross ($474,278,000 net) for the maintenance of UNOCI for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. The full amount has been assessed on Member States. In addition, the Committee, in response to the Controller's request, authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for UNOCI in the amount of $85,257,300 to meet the Operation's critical additional requirements stemming from Security Council resolutions 1933 (2010), 1942 (2010), 1951 (2010), 1967 (2011) and 1968 (2011). Accordingly, the total resources approved for UNOCI for the 2010/11 period amounted to $570,335,500 gross ($559,512,600 net). 6. Total expenditures for the period amounted to $551,482,900 gross ($540,239,100 net), with an unencumbered balance of $18,852,600 gross ($19,273,500 net), corresponding to a budget implementation rate of 96.7 per cent. As shown in section III.A of the report of the Secretary-General (A/66/616), the underexpenditure is the net result of reduced requirements of $18,877,000 under military and police personnel and of $569,800 under civilian personnel, offset, in part, by overexpenditure of $594,200 under operational costs. 7. Underexpenditures were incurred, inter alia, under: (a) Military contingents ($13,019,500, or 6.2 per cent), attributable mainly to the delayed deployment of additional military contingents, resulting in lower expenditure on reimbursement related to troop- and contingent-owned equipment, to lower travel costs for emplacement of troops and to decreased freight charges for contingent-owned equipment; (b) United Nations police ($1,839,400, or 9.2 per cent), attributable to the lower actual number and cost of rotations (308 actual rotations at an average cost of $1,300, compared with 410 planned at $4,400). In addition, evacuation allowance for United Nations police officers in the amount of $515,000 was inadvertently recorded under common staff costs for international staff; (c) Formed police units ($4,164,900, or 16.8 per cent), attributable mainly to the delayed deployment of police personnel, resulting in lower reimbursement expenditure related to formed police units and contingent-owned equipment, to lower travel costs for emplacement of formed police units and to lower freight charges for contingent-owned equipment. In addition, the cost of the transportation of contingent-owned equipment was reduced through utilization of an aircraft pertaining to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) instead of a chartered aircraft, resulting in lower positioning and depositioning costs; (d) United Nations Volunteers ($1,747,800, or 12.9 per cent), attributable to the inadvertent recording of the evacuation allowance for 191 United Nations Volunteers in the amount of $1.7 million under common staff costs for international staff; (e) General temporary assistance ($1,418,800, or 26.0 per cent), attributable to the actual average vacancy rate of 22.2 per cent for international staff, as compared with the planned full incumbency of the general temporary assistance positions. Taking into account the planned phased deployment, the recruitment for 12 international temporary positions approved for the last four months of the reporting period to assist with the reconfiguration of the supply and transit lines could not be completed before the end of the 2010/11 period; (f) Government-provided personnel ($364,500, or 60 per cent), attributable mainly to the postponement of the recruitment of the eight additional seconded Customs Officers approved under Security Council resolution 1933 (2010), owing to the ongoing post-electoral crisis. In addition, evacuation allowance in the amount of $105,000 was inadvertently recorded under common staff costs for international staff, and mission subsistence allowance was not payable during the evacuation period from January to April 2011; (g) Ground transportation ($2,857,000, or 19.5 per cent), attributable mainly to: (i) the lower actual fuel consumption of 4.8 million litres, as compared with the planned 10.1 million litres, as a result of the restriction of movement of United Nations vehicles during the post-electoral crisis and the delayed deployment of troops; and (ii) reduced requirements for the rental of vehicles owing to early termination of rental services in April 2011 as normal operation of the Operation's vehicle fleet resumed after the post-electoral crisis. The overall reduced requirements were offset in part by the acquisition of 126 general purpose 4 x 4 passenger and utility vehicles to replace vehicles due for write-off; (h) Air transportation ($1,187,100, or 1.8 per cent), attributable mainly to lower expenditure for the rental and operation of helicopters, as some helicopters were grounded during the post-electoral crisis and one helicopter was not operational due to maintenance outside the mission area between April and June 2011, offset in part by the increased price of aviation fuel ($1.27 per litre, as compared with the planned $0.95 per litre), additional flights needed for the relocation of personnel and the requirement for three additional fixed-wing aircraft temporarily deployed from another mission; (i) Communications ($419,400, or 2.5 per cent), attributable mainly to lower-than-planned acquisition of communications equipment, as such equipment was received from the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT), to fewer repair requests and to lower actual self-sustainment expenditure owing to the delayed deployment of troops. The overall reduced requirements were offset in part by the increased expenditure for equipment and services for public information activities. 8. The above-mentioned underexpenditures were, however, offset in part by additional requirements under, inter alia: (a) International staff ($1,942,400, or 2.8 per cent), attributable mainly to payments of evacuation allowance in the total amount of $2.3 million for 191 United Nations Volunteers, 63 United Nations police officers and 9 Government-provided personnel, which were inadvertently recorded under common staff costs for international staff, instead of their respective expenditure classes; (b) National staff ($654,400, or 3 per cent), attributable mainly to the lower actual average vacancy rates of 15.7 per cent for National Professional Officers and 5.5 per cent for national General Service staff, as compared with the budgeted vacancy rates of 20 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, offset in part by the lower actual hazard pay expenditure since fewer staff were assigned to hazardous duty locations from July to November 2010; (c) Official travel ($797,300, or 15.1 per cent), attributable mainly to unplanned within-mission travel related to the construction of camps in Anyama and Akouédo and the dismantling of engineering assets at six vacated camps, and to travel for sensitization campaigns and attendance at coordination meetings in the area of rule of law. Furthermore, additional travel for military consultations and mission planning assessment was undertaken; (d) Facilities and infrastructure ($2,232,700, or 3.5 per cent), attributable mainly to (i) higher generator fuel consumption (4.6 million litres as compared with the planned level of 3.1 million litres) owing to frequent power outages in the mission area; (ii) unplanned construction of new camps for additional troops and a helipad; (iii) acquisition of additional equipment as a result of the post-electoral crisis, including fuel storage bladders and tanks for contingency fuel reserves, water purification equipment, miscellaneous equipment to improve the living conditions of troops relocated to new camps, and field defence supplies to construct enhanced security facilities at the Golf Hotel, the Operation's logistics base in Bouaké and temporary headquarters in Abidjan, and a transit and accommodation camp. The overall increased requirements were offset in part by reduced requirements for rental of premises and for non-acquisition of planned prerefabricated facilities, since that requirement was covered through the transfer of such facilities from the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur and MINURCAT; (e) Other supplies, services and equipment ($3,019,600, or 27.0 per cent), attributable mainly to unplanned shipping costs for prefabricated buildings transferred from UNAMID and MINURCAT in support of the establishment of new camps in the mission area, loss on currency exchanges, and acquisition of metal platform trucks for use in warehousing facilities as well as of airport windsocks; offset in part by the underutilization of the provision made for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, since the programme had been suspended owing to the post-electoral crisis. 9. The comments of the Advisory Committee on the information contained in the performance report relating to individual objects of expenditure can be found, where relevant, in the discussion of the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 set out below. III. Financial position and information on performance for the current period 10. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 27 March 2012, a total of $3,832,021,000 had been assessed on Member States with respect to UNOCI since its inception. As at the same date, payments received amounted to $3,666,655,000, leaving an outstanding balance of $165,367,000. The Advisory Committee notes the repeated calls by the General Assembly for all Member States to fulfil their financial obligations as set out in the Charter of the United Nations on time, in full and without conditions (see resolution 65/293). 11. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 29 February 2012, no amount was owed for troops and that payments totalling $176,620,400 had been made in the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2012. As at 31 December 2011, $46,102,000 was owed for contingent-owned equipment, and payments totalling $75,117,000 had been made for contingent-owned equipment through 30 June 2011. As at 27 March 2012, the Operation had cash resources of $128,300,000; after allowing for a three-month operating cash reserve of $126,296,000, the remaining balance amounted to $2,004,000. 12. With regard to death and disability compensation, the Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 31 December 2011, $368,000 had been paid in respect of nine claims since the inception of the Operation. Unliquidated obligations for the settlement of outstanding claims amounted to $268,000. The Committee was further informed that three claims were pending. The Advisory Committee expects that all outstanding claims will be settled expeditiously. 13. The Advisory Committee was provided with information, as at 29 February 2012, on the incumbency of UNOCI military and civilian personnel for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012, as follows: Authorizeda Encumbered Vacancy rate (percentage) Military observers Military contingents United Nations police Formed police Posts International staff National staff General temporary assistance United Nations Volunteers a Represents the highest level of authorized/approved strength. 14. The Advisory Committee was also provided with information on current and projected expenditures for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 with reasons for variance. As at 31 March 2012, current expenditures amounted to $418,061,200 gross ($411,850,400 net), against an appropriation of $645,961,400 gross ($634,457,000 net), equivalent to 64.7 per cent. The total projected expenditure for the entire financial period amounts to $612,249,800 gross, which would leave a projected unencumbered balance of $33,711,600, equivalent to 5.2 per cent of the appropriation. The Committee notes that the estimated total expenditures of $612,249,800 include projected overexpenditures in the following areas: (a) Military contingents ($2,885,600), owing to the rotation of two military contingents through commercial charter and the deployment of contingent-owned equipment during the 2011/12 period, which were budgeted in the prior period; (b) Consultants ($244,100), attributed to the extension of consultant services engaged to provide training, monitoring and guidance to military officers carrying out arms embargo inspections; (c) Official travel ($1,636,700), owing to the increased within-mission travel to support the legislative elections and the construction of the six new camps in the sectors. 15. The Advisory Committee stresses the importance that travel requirements be properly budgeted and that every effort be made to ensure that expenditures remain within approved provisions. The Committee urges the Operation to monitor the utilization of resources for both consultants and official travel to ensure that these are used in the most prudent manner. 16. The Advisory Committee notes that the above-mentioned estimated overexpenditures are projected to be offset by underexpenditures in a number of expenditure categories, primarily under: (a) United Nations police ($7,309,800), owing to the delayed deployment of United Nations police officers (375, compared with the budgeted level of 595); (b) Formed police units ($2,497,300), owing to the lower cost of deploying additional contingent-owned equipment using an IL-76 aircraft from MONUSCO for the reinforcement of formed police units, instead of deploying an additional formed unit; (c) United Nations Volunteers ($6,302,500), owing to suspension of the deployment of United Nations Volunteers at the completion of the electoral process, as well as to delays in filling positions approved for the support to the elections; (d) General temporary assistance ($2,545,400), owing to delays in filling new positions approved for support to the elections; (e) Facilities and infrastructure ($2,447,100), owing to delays in the deployment of contingent-owned equipment and to the unused provision for the rental of premises in Yopougon and Aboisso since rent-free premises were provided by the Government, offset in part by increased requirements for the construction of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration camps; (f) Ground transportation ($1,356,000), attributable to lower actual fuel consumption; (g) Air transportation ($11,158,900), owing to replacement of the budgeted B-757 fixed-wing aircraft with a smaller B-737 aircraft, as well as reduction in the UNOCI fleet by one fixed-wing DHC-7 and two rotary-wing aircraft (Mi-8MTV and A-109); (h) Communications ($1,252,200), owing to reduced self-sustainment requirements; (i) Other supplies, services and equipment ($1,830,300), attributable to the lower-than-budgeted number of contractors hired for the support to the elections and curtailment of the second phase of the 1,000 microprojects programme under disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. IV. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 A. Mandate and planned results 17. The mandate of UNOCI was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1528 (2004). By its resolution 2000 (2011) of 27 July 2011, the Council extended the mandate until 31 July 2012. 18. The substantive activities to be carried out by the Operation during the 2012/13 period are described in paragraphs 6 to 11 of the proposed budget (A/66/753). As indicated in that report, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities will remain one of the major focus areas of the Operation, and the community violence reduction programme will continue to target beneficiaries most affected by the conflict in order to rebuild and rehabilitate their communities (see para. 58 below). Other programmed activities in the areas of rule of law, security sector reform and civil affairs will be maintained to support the justice system as well as to implement quick-impact projects (see para. 49 below). 19. In paragraph 7 of his report (A/66/753), the Secretary-General indicates that, in order to accommodate the deployment of the 205 police advisers, the Operation had adjusted its military troop strength downward and concomitantly increased its police strength by the same number, in line with Security Council resolution 2000 (2011). The military contingents will be deployed in 63 camps throughout the country with the main focus on Sector West, where 6 new camps have been established during the 2011/12 period. 20. In respect of cooperation with the United Nations country team, UNOCI will continue a unified United Nations system coordination approach in Côte d'Ivoire, in accordance with the integrated strategic framework, most recently updated in July 2011, as well as joint programmed activities. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that following the completion of the electoral cycle, UNOCI and the United Nations country team held a retreat in February 2012 in order to align integrated engagement in the country with evolving national priorities, taking into account the mandate and the respective roles and responsibilities of the United Nations agencies in Côte d'Ivoire. 21. The Advisory Committee was informed that an assessment mission had been deployed to Côte d'Ivoire in February 2012 to develop recommendations on possible adjustments to the structure and strength of UNOCI, taking into account the holding of the legislative elections, the prevailing security challenges and progress made in rebuilding national capacities. The Committee notes that, based on the recommendations of the assessment mission, the Secretary-General recommended, in his special report to the Security Council on the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire, that the three armed helicopters currently deployed in the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) be transferred to UNOCI and that, should the Council decide to extend the UNOCI mandate, the authorized strength of the military component be reduced from its current authorized level of 9,727 to 8,837 military personnel, comprising 8,645 troops and staff officers and 192 military observers (see S/2012/186, paras. 59 to 69). The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the implementation of the recommendations of the assessment mission would result in an overall net reduction of the requirements for the 2012/13 period in an estimated amount of $10.65 million. The Advisory Committee expects that the General Assembly will be informed of the financial and administrative implications for the 2012/13 period arising from any decision of the Security Council with respect to the assessment of UNOCI. B. Resource requirements 22. The proposed budget for UNOCI for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 amounts to $586,158,200 gross ($576,605,700 net), representing a decrease of $59,803,200, or 9.3 per cent in gross terms, over the appropriation for the preceding period. The Advisory Committee notes that, if compared to the projected expenditures of $612,249,800 for 2011/12 (see para. 14 above), the proposed resource reduction for the 2012/13 period would amount to $26,091,800, or 4.5 per cent. The proposed budget for the 2012/13 period provides for the deployment of 192 military observers, 9,395 military contingent personnel, 555 United Nations police (including 205 advisers), 1,000 formed police personnel, 451 international staff, 822 national staff, 189 United Nations Volunteers and 42 Government-provided personnel. An analysis of variances is provided in section III of the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed budget. 23. In paragraph 13 of his report, the Secretary-General indicates that the decrease in resource requirements under military and police personnel ($9,001,700), as compared with the appropriation for the 2011/12 period, is attributable to the application of delayed deployment factors for contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment based on the actual deployment trends and the exclusion of provisions made for the one-time supplemental payment to troop- and formed police- contributing countries in the 2011/12 financial period pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/289. With regard to civilian personnel, the decrease of $9,161,200 in the requirements is attributable mainly to the abolishment of the 213 temporary positions no longer required in the 2012/13 period, which were related to the elections and the surge following the post-electoral crisis, as well as to the discontinuation of hazardous duty station allowance. Under operational costs, the decrease of $41,640,300 is attributable to the reduction in requirements under facilities and infrastructure, owing mainly to the limited acquisition of new and replacement equipment; and to the reduction in requirements under air transportation, as a result of lower guaranteed costs with respect to the rental and operation of the mission's fleet of aircraft, owing to the replacement of two fixed-wing aircraft with smaller aircraft, the discontinuation of the services of two helicopters and the overall reduction in flight hours due to the completion of the electoral process. The overall reduced requirements are offset in part by increased provisions for mine detection and clearing services ($2,376,900), for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration services ($6,656,000) and for international staff ($7,176,100), the latter owing to the revised salary scale. 1. Military and police personnel Category Approved 2011/12 a Proposed 2012/13a Military contingent personnel Formed police units a Represents the highest authorized/proposed strength. 24. The estimated requirements for military and police personnel for the 2012/13 period amount to $291,346,700, a decrease of $9,001,700, or 3.0 per cent, as compared with the apportionment of $300,348,400 for the 2011/12 period. The total figure comprises reduced requirements for military observers, military contingents and United Nations police (decreases of $669,500, $7,619,600 and $771,000, respectively), offset in part by an increase of $58,400 for formed police units. The reduced requirements under military and police personnel are attributable mainly to the exclusion of provisions for the one-time supplemental payment to troop- and formed police-contributing countries approved for the 2011/12 period; the reduction in troop strength by 140 from 9,535 in the 2011/12 period to 9,395; the lower requirement for rations owing to exchange rate fluctuations and the anticipated reduction in consumption; the application of 1 per cent unserviceability and 0.4 per cent non-deployment factors to contingent-owned equipment deployed in the mission area; the reduction of 40 United Nations police and the application of a delayed deployment factor of 10 per cent for United Nations police, compared with 5.8 per cent applied for the 2011/12 period. The reduced requirements are offset in part by the increased requirement for formed police units, owing to the lower delayed deployment factor of 1 per cent, compared with 4.9 per cent in the current period, and the increase in the number of formed police personnel from 820 to 1,000 for the 2012/13 period. 25. The Advisory Committee recommends approval of the requested resources for military and police personnel. 2. Civilian personnel Approved 2011/12a International posts National postsb Temporary positionsc Government-provided personneld Total a Represents the highest level of authorized/proposed strength. b Includes National Professional Officers and national General Service staff. c Funded under general temporary assistance. d Funded under operational costs. 26. The estimated requirement for civilian personnel for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 amounts to $113,011,300, reflecting a decrease of $9,161,200, or 7.5 per cent, in comparison with the apportionment for the 2011/12 period. The overall reduction in the requirement comprises a decrease of $2,264,500 in the requirement for national staff, attributable to the discontinuation of hazardous duty station allowance and the non-applicability of danger pay to the mission area; a decrease of $8,187,000 in the requirement for United Nations Volunteers, attributable to the abolishment of 164 positions established primarily for electoral support, as well as the discontinuation of hazardous duty station allowance and the non-applicability of danger pay to the mission area; and a decrease of $5,885,800 in the requirements for general temporary assistance, attributable mainly to the abolishment of 49 positions following the completion of the electoral process and completion of activities related to the deployment of additional military personnel. The decreased requirements are offset in part by increased requirements under international staff of $7,176,100, owing to the application of a revised salary scale for internationally recruited civilian staff in effect from January 2012 and the computation of common staff costs requirements at 82 per cent of net salaries, compared with 75 per cent in the 2011/12 financial period, based on the actual expenditure patterns. 27. The proposed budget reflects the application of vacancy factors of 10 per cent for international posts (compared with 14.9 per cent in the preceding period), 8 per cent for National Professional Officer posts (compared with 16.4 per cent for the 2011/12 period); 5 per cent for national General Service posts (compared with 7.2 per cent in the 2011/12 period); 5 per cent for United Nations Volunteers (compared with 12.9 per cent in the 2011/12 period); 15 per cent for international temporary positions (compared with 6.5 per cent for the 2011/12 period) and 5 per cent for temporary national General Service positions (compared with zero per cent in the 2011/12 period). 28. The Advisory Committee was informed that the actual vacancy rates for approved posts in UNOCI in the current period, as at 29 February 2012, stood at 15.5 per cent for international staff, 23.2 for National Professional Officer posts and 5.5 per cent for national General Service posts, while the actual vacancy rates for temporary positions stood at 55 per cent for international staff, 67 per cent for national staff and 21.2 per cent for United Nations Volunteers. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that if the temporary positions proposed for abolishment in the 2012/13 period were excluded from the vacancy statistics, and taking into account the Operation's projections of recruitment against the continuing temporary positions, the vacancy rates for temporary positions projected at 30 June 2012 would be 15 per cent for international staff, 8 per cent for National Professional Officers, 5 per cent for national General Service positions and 5 per cent for United Nations Volunteers, which is near the proposed budgeted levels for the 2012/13 period. The Committee was further informed that a total of 74 of the positions proposed for abolition in 2012/13 had been vacated by 29 February 2012 and that the Operation projected a vacancy rate of 15 per cent in respect of international posts by the end of June 2012. 29. In this regard, the Advisory Committee notes, from the supplementary information provided to it, that in the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011, prior to onset of the post-electoral crisis, the actual vacancy rate for international posts had averaged 15.3 per cent and that the vacancy rate for international posts had averaged 16.2 per cent in the period from 1 July 2011 to 29 February 2012. The Advisory Committee therefore considers that the proposed vacancy factor for international posts may not be realistic and recommends that the vacancy factor for international posts should be adjusted to 15 per cent. Comments and recommendations on posts/positions 30. The Secretary-General is proposing a net overall decrease of 212 posts and positions for UNOCI, comprising a net decrease of 49 temporary positions and of 164 United Nations Volunteer positions, offset by an increase of one international post. The Secretary-General is also proposing the reassignment of one post and the abolition of 213 positions. A detailed summary of the proposed staffing changes is contained in annex I to the present report. New posts Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 31. The Secretary-General proposes to establish a post of Special Adviser to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the P-5 level. The incumbent would be responsible for the provision of cross-cutting advice on Operation-wide issues and policy planning in support of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and would play a key role in determining the Operation's priorities and objectives. The incumbent would also be responsible for the coordination of political advice provided to the Special Representative and the Deputy Special Representatives, in close cooperation with the Political Affairs Section and the Office of the Chief of Staff, and for devising proposed strategies for the political direction of the Operation (A/66/753, para. 26). The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the incumbent of the proposed post would focus on integrating substantive analysis and policy options received from the various pillars of UNOCI and would serve as a resource for the Operation as a whole. The Advisory Committee does not object to the functions of the proposed post of Special Adviser, but considers that this requirement can be met through the redeployment or reassignment of an approved post. The Committee therefore requests that the Operation review its staffing to identify an existing post for this purpose and to report thereon in the context of the 2013/14 budget submission. Reassignments 32. Under executive direction and management, it is proposed that one Field Service post of Receiving and Inspection Assistant be reassigned from the General Services Section to the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General to serve as an Administrative Assistant. The incumbent of the post would assist in managing the flow of information and in processing the increased volume of correspondence due to the increase in reporting obligations, while ensuring confidentiality (A/66/753, para. 27). The Advisory Committee has no objection to the proposed reassignment; however, it remains concerned at the continued shortcomings highlighted by the Board of Auditors in the area of asset management in peacekeeping operations (see also A/65/5 (Vol. II), para. 138). The Committee trusts that the proposed reassignment will not weaken the Operation's ability to ensure effective stewardship of assets (see also A/66/719, para. 20). Abolitions Component 3: peace consolidation 33. It is proposed that a total of 180 positions in the Electoral Assistance Office, comprising two D-1, two P-5, six P-4, 10 P-3, one P-2, one Field Service, three National Professional Officer positions and 155 international United Nations Volunteer positions be abolished, owing to the completion of the mandated electoral tasks and the absence of subsequent tasks contained in the current mandate of the Operation, resulting in no further need for the Electoral Assistance Office. Mission support 34. Under Administrative Services, it is proposed that a total of five positions be abolished. These positions comprise one national General Service position of Human Resources Assistant in the Human Resources Section, which was budgeted under general temporary assistance in the 2011/12 period to support the increased workload mainly related to additional electoral staff, as well as to address the challenges associated with the post-electoral crisis; one Field Service position of Procurement Officer and two national General Service positions of Procurement Assistants established under general temporary assistance to support the Operation during the elections and the deployment of military personnel following the postelectoral crisis, owing to the completion of related procurement activities; and one United Nations Volunteer position of Facilities Management Assistant, originally established to support the Operation in activities associated with the establishment of new camps during the deployment of military personnel following the post-electoral crisis, owing to completion of the related activities. 35. Under Integrated Support Services, it is proposed that a total of 28 positions, established in the 2011/12 period under general temporary assistance to support the deployment of additional military contingents and formed police units, be abolished. These positions comprise one Field Service post of Contingent-owned Equipment Assistant in the Office of the Chief of Integrated Support Services; two Field Service positions of Logistics Assistants in the Joint Logistics Operations Centre; three Field Service posts (one Rations Assistant and two Quality Control Assistants) and one national General Service Fuel Assistant; three Field Service posts of Electrical Assistant, Engineering Assistant and HVAC Technician and five United Nations Volunteer positions (two Engineering Assistants, an Electrical Assistant, a HVAC Assistant and a Materials Management Assistant) in the Engineering Section; two national General Service positions of Vehicle Mechanics in the Transport Section; six general temporary assistance positions in the Aviation Section, comprising one Field Service position of Air Operations Officer and five national General Service positions (four Air Operations Assistants and one Ramp Manager), and one United Nations Volunteer position of Air Operations Assistant; two United Nations Volunteer positions of Movement Control Assistant, one Field Service general temporary assistance position of Movement Control Officer and one national General Service general temporary assistance position of a Materials and Assets Assistant in the Movement Control Section. 36. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in the context of its consideration of the reports of the Secretary-General on supplementary estimates for UNOCI in the 2011/12 period (A/66/612 and A/66/529), it had recommended the approval of a total of 43 posts and positions, comprising one P-3, 14 Field Service, two National Professional Officer, 17 national General Service positions and nine United Nations Volunteer positions. The Committee further recalls that the 43 approved positions under component 5, support, had been proposed under the supplementary estimates as temporary positions to support the additional uniformed personnel and related activities under the new mandate only through 30 June 2012 (see A/66/612, para. 62). The Committee notes that 10 of the positions have been included in the proposed budget for the 2012/13 period. Upon enquiry, the Committee was provided with additional justification for the retention of the 10 posts (see annex II). 37. The Advisory Committee notes that, of the 10 positions approved for component 5, support, under the supplementary estimates through 30 June 2012 and proposed to be kept in the 2012/13 period, one National Professional Officer is proposed to be retained in order to ensure the smooth and uninterrupted functioning of a critical incident stress intervention cell. In this regard, the Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the existing capacity of UNOCI in the area of staff counselling is five personnel, comprising one P-4 post, one P-3 post, one national General Service post and two United Nations Volunteer posts. Considering the existing capacity of the Operation in the area of staff counselling, the Advisory Committee does not support the continuation of the position of Staff Counsellor (National Professional Officer). 38. The Advisory Committee notes that one Field Service position, approved under the supplementary estimates through 30 June 2012, is proposed to be retained in the 2012/13 period in order to provide Geographic Information System support to the newly deployed troops. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the existing capacity of the Geographic Information Systems Unit in UNOCI comprises five staff (one P-3 post, two national General Service posts and two United Nations Volunteer posts). Considering the existing capacity of the geographic information systems area in UNOCI, the Advisory Committee does not support the continuation of the Geographic Information Systems Assistant (Field Service) position. 39. The Advisory Committee notes that one National Professional Officer position of Interpreter, approved for the Office of the Chief of Administrative Services under the supplementary estimates through 30 June 2012, is proposed to be retained in the 2012/13 period, owing to the increased requirements for translation and interpretation services in assisting the uniformed personnel deployed from nonfrancophone countries. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that there are no other interpreter posts or positions approved for the Office of the Chief of Administrative Services. The Advisory Committee is not convinced of the continued requirement for the position of Interpreter (National Professional Officer) in the Office of the Chief of Administrative Services. 40. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the abolitions proposed by the Secretary-General as outlined in paragraphs 33 to 36 above. In addition, the Committee recommends the further reduction of three temporary positions as outlined in paragraphs 37, 38 and 39 above. 3. Operational costs (Thousands of United States dollars) Approved 2011/12 Proposed 2012/13 Variance Operational costs 41. The estimated operational costs for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 amount to $181,800,200, representing a decrease of $41,640,300, or 18.6 per cent, over the apportionment for the 2011/12 period. The decrease is attributable mainly to reduced requirements for official travel, facilities and infrastructure, ground transportation, air transportation, communications, information technology, special equipment and other supplies, equipment and services, offset in part by increased requirements under the Government-provided personnel and medical categories. Facilities and infrastructure 42. Estimated requirements for facilities and infrastructure for the 2012/13 period amount to $57,012,000, a decrease of $20,160,300, or 26.1 per cent, compared with the apportionment of $77,172,300 for the preceding period. The Secretary-General indicates in paragraph 86 of his report (A/66/753) on the proposed budget that the decrease is attributable primarily to: (a) the limited acquisition of equipment and supplies to replace only equipment that is damaged and/or worn-out beyond economical repair since the Operation will continue to use the existing inventories and major acquisitions were included in the 2011/12 budget; (b) rental of premises due to the closing of three sites and provision, on a rent-free basis by the Government, of the Sebroko mission headquarters and Yopougon site; (c) lower provisions for maintenance, construction and alteration and renovation services since new camps will be completed during the 2011/12 financial period; and (d) reduced requirements for spare parts and supplies owing to anticipated reduced consumption. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that all construction projects planned to be implemented in the current period had been completed, with the exception of the military camp to be constructed at the Yopougon site. The Committee was informed that the major construction projects in the 2012/13 period comprised the construction of an integrated logistics base and the completion of the Yopougon military camp. The Advisory Committee expects that the Operation will closely monitor the progress of these and all construction projects and will ensure the necessary oversight by Headquarters. The Committee comments further on the issue of construction in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping (A/66/718). Ground transportation 43. Estimated requirements for ground transportation for the 2012/13 period amount to $11,147,800, a decrease of $4,007,700, or 26.4 per cent, compared with the apportionment of $15,155,500 for the preceding period. In paragraph 87 of his report (A/66/753), the Secretary-General indicates that the decrease is attributable to the reduction of the overall ground fleet by 85 vehicles, which, the Committee was informed, are scheduled for write-off in the 2012/13 period. In addition, the reduced requirement is attributable to the continuing utilization of the Operation's vehicle fleet through the extension of the useful life of vehicles subject to write-off and replacement and reduced requirements for spare parts, due to anticipated reduced consumption. The Committee was further informed, however, that the proposed requirement included additional resources for repairs and maintenance, attributable to the extension of the useful life of vehicles. 44. From the supplementary information provided to it, the Advisory Committee notes that for the 2012/13 period, during which 640 international personnel are proposed, it is planned that 220 light passenger vehicles will be distributed among international staff, which is significantly above the allocation which would be derived from the application of the standard ratios established for peacekeeping operations. While the Advisory Committee recognizes the need for mission personnel to have access to vehicles for the performance of their official duties, it recommends that UNOCI further review its vehicle holdings and make necessary adjustments to align its vehicle holdings with the standard ratios. The Committee requests that information in this regard be provided in the context of the budget proposal for the 2013/14 period, including, if applicable, justification for proposed holdings in excess of the standard ratios. The Committee comments further on the issue of vehicle holdings and standard ratios in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping (A/66/718). 45. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that procurement was still in process for the vehicles approved under the supplementary budget for the 2011/12 period (see A/66/529, para. 90), consisting of 43 light vehicles and one medium bus, and that the vehicles had still not been received by the Operation. The Committee was further informed that the anticipated operational deficit in the vehicle holdings of the Operation in the 2012/13 period, attributable to the non-replacement of the 85 vehicles due for write-off, would be mitigated by the deployment of the 44 vehicles currently under procurement. The Advisory Committee regrets the delay in the procurement process for the additional vehicles, which were intended to support the additional military and civilian personnel being deployed. Air transportation 46. Estimated requirements for air transportation for the 2012/13 period amount to $37,176,000, a decrease of $19,357,200, or 34.2 per cent, over the apportionment of $56,533,200 in the preceding period. It is indicated that the decrease is primarily attributable to the replacement of two fixed-wing aircraft by smaller aircraft (B757 replaced with B-737 and DHC-7 replaced with B-200) and the reduction of two helicopters, combined with the overall reduction in flight hours due to the completion of the electoral process (A/66/753, para. 88). It is indicated that the Operation's aircraft fleet for the 2012/13 period will include four passenger fixed-wing aircraft and eight helicopters, comprising three civilian and five military helicopters (ibid., para. 89). 47. The Secretary-General highlights the impact of the shortfall in requirements for military utility and attack helicopters. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed, that as at 31 March 2012, the shortfall of military helicopters in peacekeeping operations amounted to 33 aircraft. As noted above, in his special report to the Security Council on UNOCI, the Secretary-General recommends that three armed helicopters, presently deployed in UNMIL, be transferred to UNOCI and that, although based in Côte d'Ivoire, the helicopters could be used in both Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia under a specific inter-mission cooperation arrangement (S/2012/186, para. 63). The Committee was informed, upon inquiry, that since the helicopters would be used in both missions, the related operational costs, estimated at $9.4 million per year, would be shared on a 50/50 basis between UNMIL and UNOCI. The Advisory Committee encourages continued efforts by the Secretary-General to identify innovative ways to address the present shortfall of military helicopters. Information technology 48. The Advisory Committee notes that the provision for the acquisition of information technology equipment for the 2012/13 period reflects a reduction of $2,240,200, or 78.8 per cent, compared with the resources for the 2011/12 period. This is stated as being attributable to the lower number of computers identified for replacement and reduced requirements related to spare parts and supplies owing to anticipated reduced consumption. The Committee was informed that current holdings of computer devices amount to 2,914 devices, including 692 that are used for purposes such as training; Internet cafés; Internet connectivity to contingents; telephone billing; programming of servers and radios; and CARLOG. The Committee was further informed that the mission ratio of users to computer devices for national staff is 1:1, whereas the standard ratio is 2.5:1. While noting the reduction in the level of acquisition of information technology equipment, the Advisory Committee is of the view that the Operation should consider further reductions in its holdings of computers. The Committee comments further on the issue of holdings of information technology equipment in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping (A/66/718). Quick-impact projects 49. Estimated requirements for quick-impact projects for the 2012/13 period amount to $2,000,000, the same level as the apportionment in the preceding period. The Secretary-General indicates that the continued implementation of quick-impact projects across Côte d'Ivoire will create a positive environment for the Operation's activities and contribute more effectively in the critical phase of peace consolidation, where the main challenges still remain to be addressed with regard to the reunification of the country, the effective restoration of State authority, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, and national reconciliation (see A/66/753, para. 73). He also indicates in the report that quick-impact projects will continue to be used as a tool to help UNOCI gain acceptance by a community, and to help to stabilize the observed increase of trust towards UNOCI in some areas of the country, particularly in the war-affected regions in the centre, north and west (ibid., para. 74). The Advisory Committee considers quick-impact projects to be an effective tool and encourages the Operation to undertake the implementation of quick-impact projects in the war-effected regions. Training 50. Provision is made of $2,131,600 for training activities during the 2012/13 period, consisting of $340,800 for training consultants, $1,546,600 for official travel for training purposes and $244,200 for training fees, supplies and services (A/66/753, para. 59). In paragraph 60 of his report, the Secretary-General provides information on the planned number of training participants for both external courses and those to be carried out within UNOCI. The Secretary-General also indicates in the report that 152 international staff would participate in training courses outside the mission area, while training courses inside the mission area would be made available to 1,415 participants. It is also indicated in the report that 18 national staff would participate in external trainings in the same period. The Advisory Committee notes that, in paragraph 22 of its resolution 66/246, the General Assembly stressed that the largest possible share of resources provided for training purposes should be directed towards the preparation and delivery of training and that ancillary costs, including associated travel, should be minimized. The Advisory Committee considers that the resources proposed for travel on training are high and that the Operation should reprioritize its planned training programme. The Committee recommends that the provision for travel on training be maintained at the level of the approved appropriation for the 2011/12 period and, as such, that the proposed resources be reduced by $93,800. The Committee comments further on training in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping (A/66/718). 51. The Advisory Committee has no objection to the resources for operational costs proposed by the Secretary-General, subject to the recommendations made in paragraphs 50 above and 59 below. V. Other matters A. Efficiency initiatives 52. It is indicated in the report that efficiency gains, resulting in a reduction to the baseline for the 2012/13 proposed budget amounting to $19,980,200 (see A/66/753, para. 55), will be achieved in the following areas: (a) Military and police personnel ($1,429,000), through reduction in rations by 5 per cent through closer management of the ration stocks due to the integration of the military and civilian elements of the support component; (b) Facilities and infrastructure, through efficiencies in consumption leading to reduced requirements for spare parts and supplies through closer management of requirements ($710,000); the reduction of fuel consumption owing to improved fuel management through shutting down the air-conditioning system and lights starting at 1930 hours on a daily basis ($259,400); the installation of solar power generation systems in five camps in Yopougon and Anyama and in the existing camps in Bouaké Airport and Daloa headquarters to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by utilizing solar power as an alternative energy source ($2,500); the installation of environment-friendly wastewater treatment systems in two new camps in Anyama and Yopougon to reduce the environmental impact produced by effluents from camps ($90,000); (c) Ground transportation, through the reduction of fuel consumption owing to improved fuel management by reinforcing the liberty mileage charges and the increased field presence of staff, which reduces the need for long distance travel ($626,500); efficiencies in consumption leading to reduced requirements for spare parts and supplies through closer management of requirements ($701,100); (d) Air transportation, through a change in the composition of the Operation's aircraft fleet with the replacement of two fixed-wing aircraft with smaller aircraft (see para. 46 above) ($14,285,100); the reduction of fuel consumption owing to improved fuel management through the monthly planning of routine military flights so that the positioning/repositioning of the aircraft is combined with weekly scheduled flights, wherever feasible ($542,000); (e) Communications and information technology, through the extension of the useful economic life of current assets ($872,000); efficiencies in consumption leading to reduced requirements for spare parts through closer management of requirements ($312,600); stricter control and scrutiny of telephony services (personal local calls charged to users), as well as stricter control on approving roaming services ($150,000). 53. The Advisory Committee notes the inclusion of efficiency gains in the budget for the period 2012/13 and encourages the Operation to identify further areas for efficiency during the 2013/14 period and to provide more detailed information thereon in the context of future budget submissions. The Committee comments further on efficiency gains in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping (A/66/718). B. Regional mission cooperation 54. It is indicated in paragraph 18 of the report that UNOCI will continue to enhance regional mission cooperation with UNMIL, the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) and the United Nations Office for West Africa (UNOWA) under the auspices of the United Nations West Africa administrative conference, where a number of administrative and logistical issues are discussed and steps are taken to identify areas for joint collaboration. The Advisory Committee continues to support the initiatives being undertaken towards greater regional cooperation between missions. In paragraph 78 of his report on progress in the implementation of the global field support strategy (A/66/591), the Secretary-General proposes the establishment of an additional regional service centre in the region of West Africa. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe, Uganda, had provided UNOCI with support in training, air transportation and regional procurement and that a new regional service centre for West Africa would provide a hub for the provision of back-office transactional functions and opportunities for process improvement and productivity and cost savings. The Committee notes, in this context, that the proposed concept of a regional service centre to cover missions in West Africa may have an impact on current cooperation arrangements. The Committee comments further on the proposed concept of a new regional service centre in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping (A/66/718). C. Mine detection and mine clearing services 55. It is indicated in the report that in parallel with the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, the Operation is initiating programmes through the United Nations Mine Action Service to reduce the risk of unexploded munitions from the recent fighting. These programmes will include clearing of unexploded ordnance and the management of weapons and ammunition. Additional requirements are anticipated in the area of specialized training and capacity-building of national security institutions (Forces republicaines de Côte d'Ivoire (FRCI), police and gendarmerie) in order to ensure the sustainability of activities. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that there was no incidence of the presence of mines reported in Côte d'Ivoire and that the main tasks of the Operation were the disposal of explosive remnants of war and the collection and disposal of the arms and ammunition of ex-combatants. The Committee was further informed that the requested resources also provide for the refurbishment of weapons and ammunition storage areas, armouries and radio rooms at several locations in the country that are currently unsafe and insecure. This requires the reconstruction of three national ammunition depots, 20 rooms for use by police, 20 gendarmerie armouries and 20 FRCI weapons/ammunition stores, which help to end unregulated proliferation of illicit weapons and to reduce the risk of insecurity caused by unexploded ordnance left over from the post-electoral crisis. 56. The estimated resource requirements under this heading for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 amount to $7,376,900 (A/66/753, para. 68). The Advisory Committee was informed that expenditure in the 2010/11 period on activities undertaken through the United Nations Mine Action Service amounted to $388,600 and that in the current period, from an apportionment of $5 million approved in the context of the supplementary estimates, a total of $1,551,900 had been expended as at 29 February 2012. The Advisory Committee encourages the Operation to continue its efforts in the disposal of explosive remnants of war and the collection and disposal of the arms and ammunition of ex-combatants. D. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 57. The estimated resource requirements for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 amount to $22,050,000 (A/66/753, paras. 63-67). The Advisory Committee was informed that related expenditure in the 2010/11 period amounted to $972,100 and that in the current period, as at 29 February 2012, a total of $1,075,100, or 6.8 per cent of the current appropriation of $15,837,800, had been expended on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities in UNOCI. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that no national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration framework was yet in place, but that following the completion of the electoral process, the Operation was confident that significant progress would be made in the near future to launch the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process in Côte d'Ivoire. The Committee was further informed, upon enquiry, that the beneficiaries of the insertion programme would be accommodated for three to nine months at the expense of the Government in designated training centres throughout the country. The reinsertion package, at a cost of approximately $1,000 per beneficiary, would include options for sensitization, civic education, literacy, mathematics, cooperative management and entrepreneurship. Certified technical training programmes would be offered in such areas as agriculture, livestock farming, construction and public works craftsmanship, small business, information technology and renewable energy resources, and that the beneficiaries would be provided with a certificate documenting their participation in the reinsertion programme. 58. It is indicated in paragraph 67 of the report that the implementation of community violence reduction projects is foreseen in compliance with Security Council resolution 2000 (2011), by which UNOCI is mandated to support the Government in coordination with other partners to develop and implement community weapons collection programmes, which should be linked to community violence reduction and reconciliation. The Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that community violence reduction projects are to be integrated into the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme and would commence along with it, and that lessons learned had shown that community violence reduction needed to target a specific caseload of ex-combatants that remained within their communities of origin. The Committee was further informed that the Operation had been working with such communities for six months, particularly in the west and border areas. Standard operating procedures had been developed for the implementation of community violence reduction projects, and potential projects with targeted communities of ex-combatants had been developed in order to expedite implementation of the process once the programme commenced and the eligibility criteria had been determined. The Advisory Committee notes the positive impact of community violence reduction projects in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and encourages the Operation to draw lessons, where applicable, from the experience of other missions. The Committee comments further on the issue of community violence reduction projects in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping (A/66/718). 59. The Advisory Committee recognizes the importance of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and related activities to the completion of the mandate of the Operation. However, the Committee is of the view that, given the absence of the finalized disarmament, demobilization and reintegration framework, and that, in the past, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme had experienced delays, the total amount proposed may not be required during the 2012/13 period. The Committee therefore recommends that the proposed amount should be reduced to $20 million. The Committee nevertheless encourages the Operation to implement disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and related activities as expeditiously as possible. Should additional funding be necessary, the Operation should report thereon in the context of the performance report. VI. Conclusion 60. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNOCI for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 are contained in section V of the performance report (A/66/616). The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly apply other income in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2011 in the total amount of $7,632,400, from interest income ($1,707,800), other/miscellaneous income ($474,100) and cancellation of prior-period obligations ($5,450,500), against the shortfall in assessment of $66,404,700 for the same period, and assess the additional amount of $58,772,300, representing the difference between the increase in the appropriation ($66,404,700) and other income ($7,632,400) for the period ended 30 June 2011. 61. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNOCI for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 are contained in section IV of the proposed budget (A/66/753). The Advisory Committee recommends that, should the Security Council decide to extend the mandate of UNOCI beyond 31 July 2012, the General Assembly appropriate an amount of $578,815,197 for the maintenance of the Operation for the 12-month period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013.

Annex II Temporary positions proposed to be retained at the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire in the 2012/13 period It is proposed that the following 10 positions, approved under the supplementary estimates for the budget for the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire for the 2011/12 period, be retained under component 5, support, during the 2012/13 period, owing to the continuous nature of the functions needed to support additional uniformed personnel authorized in the supplementary budget: (a) Contingent-Owned Equipment Officer (P-3) and Contingent-Owned Assistant (Field Service).
