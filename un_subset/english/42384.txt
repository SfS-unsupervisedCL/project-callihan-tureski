In 2002, the extent to which commemorative names could be adopted in the planning of new place names in Helsinki and the grounds for their adoption generated lively discussions both in public and in the Place-Names Committee of the City of Helsinki. Especially intensive were the discussions on long street names with personal names and titles. Other topical issues included the extent to which the persons honoured by a commemorative name were known to the public in general and the share of commemorative names as compared with all names in use, as well as the length of the waiting period before a commemorative name could be given. Following these discussions, the Place-Names Committee made a recommendation on the use of commemorative names in Helsinki. The recommendation and its justifications, issued by the Committee on 15 September 2004, were reported in working paper 45 of the twenty-third session of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names, (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/gegn23wp45.pdf), and are in harmony with both resolution VIII/2 and the recommendations of the Finnish Language Board.
