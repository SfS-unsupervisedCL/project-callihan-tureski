Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1540 (2004) Note verbale dated 13 December 2005 from the Permanent Mission of Argentina to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Committee The Permanent Mission of the Argentine Republic to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Chairman of the Committee established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) and has the honour to transmit herewith the Argentine Republic's second report on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) (see annex). Second report of the Argentine Republic on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) The Argentine Republic thanks the Committee established pursuant to Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) for its letter and attached matrix and has the honour to transmit in response the country's second report. Argentina continues to support a committed non-proliferation policy, and over the course of the past year has strengthened that commitment regionally by organizing seminars on the implementation of resolution 1540 (2004). The first such seminar, organized jointly by Argentina and Spain, was attended by officials from those two countries and from Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic and specifically addressed the issues connected with preparing the reports of Central American and Caribbean countries. From 26 to 28 September, Buenos Aires hosted a seminar entitled "Moving toward Implementation of Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004)" for all the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, organized together with the United Kingdom with the aim of promoting implementation of resolution 1540 (2004). The seminar was the first opportunity for the Committee established pursuant to that resolution to make contact with representatives from an entire region. The conclusions of both seminars were presented to the Chairman of the Committee and circulated to the States represented on the Committee. Unfortunately, Argentina's commitment to the objectives of resolution 1540 (2004) has been set against a backdrop of growing concern in 2005 at the lack of progress on non-proliferation and disarmament issues, particularly in the nuclear field. Examples of this include the failure of the seventh Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach concrete agreements on non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, resulting in the adoption, on 27 May 2005, of a Final Document without conclusions and recommendations. Similarly, the outcome of the United Nations 2005 World Summit (millennium +5 summit), held in September 2005, contained no chapter on disarmament and non-proliferation, because of the irreconcilable differences between various members of the international community. Argentina firmly believes that the international community's commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation must be renewed, with fulfilment of the obligations of resolution 1540 (2004) as a significant step, but not the only step, towards that goal. Accordingly, and in keeping with paragraph 10 of resolution 1540 (2004), Argentina announced its decision in March 2005 to work on the principles of the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) in cases where particular PSI activities required its support. Argentina has also welcomed the amendments to the Rome Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (1988) adopted within the framework of the International Maritime Organization. These enabled international rules and regulations on the physical safety of shipping to be reviewed in the light of the threat of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, providing a legal framework for PSI activities. Furthermore, on 9 May 2005, Argentina signed a memorandum of understanding with the United States of America in connection with the Container Security Initiative (CSI), becoming the first country in South America to sign a CSI agreement. The entry of the port of Buenos Aires and the Exolgan terminal at Dock Sud into CSI marks the beginning of a specific cooperation programme which will improve the security of maritime cargo and bilateral trade with the United States of America even further in the future, especially in with regard to countering international terrorism and the risk of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of non-State actors. In the light of paragraphs 3(c), 3(d) and 9, and of the fact that training of the staff directly involved in export control is vital to better fulfilment of the commitments made in international treaties and agreements and of the obligations imposed by resolution 1540 (2004), a Commodity Identification Training seminar, for customs officials and for the forces responsible for port and border control, will be held in Buenos Aires from 14 to 16 December 2005. The seminar, organized jointly by the Nuclear Regulatory Authority and the United States Department of Energy, will deal with issues including the identification of legitimate cargo, the development of missile systems and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and export control. Each section of the seminar will include practical exercises focusing on visual identification of the goods being checked. With regard to updating import- and export-control legislation, Argentina is pleased to report that, on 26 June 2005, the Federal Public Revenue Administration issued resolution 1892. That resolution adds the contents of Chemical Weapons Convention schedules 1 and 2 to the María customs database system, so that imports of such substances can be checked. The National Registry of Weapons (RENAR) has been given the authority to check and authorize all imports connected with the substances in schedules 1 and 2. The relevant information appears on page 27 of the attached matrix. In addition, all the information in Argentina's national reports and the matrix on Argentine rules and regulations appears on the website www.infoleg.gov.ar. As a contribution to the international community's disarmament efforts, Argentina presented its report on the implementation of article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in keeping with the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (thirteen steps). For the first time in the history of the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, Argentina presented a declaration on behalf of the Latin American countries which are members of the Conference, calling for it to begin work rapidly on the basis of more flexibility in States' positions. Attached is a matrix entitled Annex A, which includes amendments (green font) suggesting possible ways of reconciling the steps in the report with the framework proposed by the Committee experts. Finally, to provide information additional to that provided in Argentina's first report on membership of conventions, treaties and agreements, Annex B contains detailed information on the signing and ratification of those acts.
