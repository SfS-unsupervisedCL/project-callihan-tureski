United Nations A/C.5/54/17 General Assembly Distr.: General 14 October 1999 Original: English Fifty-fourth session Fifth Committee Agenda item 121 Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 Reformulated narrative of section 27C, Office of Human Resources Management, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 Note by the Secretary-General 1. In paragraph 439 of the report on its thirty-ninth session,1 the Committee for Programme and Coordination recommended that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to reformulate the narrative of section 27C, Office of Human Resources Management, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001,2 in accordance with its resolution 53/221 of 7 April 1999, and that the revised narrative be submitted to the Assembly for consideration at its fifty-fourth session.2 2. Accordingly, the Secretariat has reviewed the programme narrative of section 27C in the light of the provisions of resolution 53/221. In order to reflect the overall objectives of the resolution, it is proposed that should the General Assembly decide to accept the recommendation of the Committee for Programme and Coordination, it may wish to consider replacing paragraph 27C.6 of the proposed narrative under that section with a new paragraph as follows: “27C.6 In line with the above objectives and following the guidance provided by the General Assembly in its resolution 53/221 of 7 April 1999, the Office would focus on: (a) progressive implementation of staff training and development programmes to build organizational capacity and enhance career development opportunities; (b) strengthening of performance management in the Organization; (c) concentration of its resources in designated areas to manage the process of delegation of authority and the monitoring and accountability systems, utilizing the particular advantages of the Integrated Management Information System; (d) continuation of improvements in recruitment, placement and promotion procedures with a view to making them simpler, more transparent and more timely; (e) continuation of improvements in the Secretariat-wide human resources planning system; (f) establishment of mechanisms towards and implementation of enhanced mobility across functions, departments and duty stations and among organizations of the United Nations common system; and (g) contributing to the staff-management global consultative process. That would require the concentration of resources in priority areas of the Office through internal redeployment to the extent possible as well as the further strengthening of priority areas through the addition of resources.” Notes 1 Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-fourth Session, Supplement No. 16 (A/54/16). 2 Ibid., Supplement No. 6 (A/54/6/Rev.1).
