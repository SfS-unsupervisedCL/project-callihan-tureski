UNITED NATIONS United Nations Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court Distr. GENERAL A/CONF.183/12 17 July 1998 Original: ENGLISH Rome, Italy 15 June—17 July 1998 COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE DECLARATION BY THE DELEGATION OF THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS The delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands states that the principle of equitable burden sharing regarding the imprisonment of an irrevocable sentence by the International Criminal Court is an imperative duty of vital importance of all States Parties to the present Statute. On the basis of this principle the future preparatory negotiations will elaborate this principle in further detail. The residual duty of the host State to imprison sentenced persons if the Court has not been able to designate a State of imprisonment will only apply in an exceptional situation, which inherently does not conform to the principle of equitable burden sharing.
