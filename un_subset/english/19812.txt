Mangueira Minister Counsellor Chargé d'affaires a.i. Statement of the Government of the Republic of Angola on the ceasefire settlement of the Government and UNITA general military staff The Government of National Unity of the Republic of Angola meeting today, 30 March 2002, congratulates the military leadership of the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) and of the UNITA's Armed Forces for the understanding reached regarding the establishment of a general ceasefire and the implementation of the remaining military tasks under the Lusaka Protocol. The Government of the Republic of Angola praises the seriousness and maturity of this milestone, which creates the conditions for the conclusion of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and for the definitive end of the armed conflict in Angola, opening new perspectives for the life of all Angolans, who will finally be able to dedicate themselves in peace to the tasks of reconstruction and enlargement of our country. The Government of the Republic of Angola welcomes with affability the climate of cooperation, fraternity and verified patriotism during the military conversations that enabled the transformations of mistrust and doubt, common in processes of this nature, into a candid exploration of efficient solutions for concrete problems of great impact to the destiny of the nation, among which are the disengagement, quartering and conclusion of the demilitarization of UNITA, and for the incorporation of its staff for future selection and incorporation of its generals, officers, sergeants and soldiers into the Angolan Armed Forces and the National Police, in accordance with the existing institutional vacancies, as well as the consequent social reintegration of demobilization into civil society through competent agencies and entities of the Government. The Cabinet also approved, in this context, a draft for the Amnesty Law that will be submitted to the National Assembly to address crimes of military nature and against the security of the State that have been committed during the armed conflict. The Government considers that, upon resolving the military issues, it will be possible to proceed to the second phase, referring to the political items of the Lusaka Protocol, creating the necessary mechanisms which require UNITA to freely and independently reach consensus on the appointment of its participants. The Government reaffirms that only with the full participation of all citizens in national life, in the use of their legitimate rights of free speech, in tolerance and acceptance of differences and respect for the constituted legality, will it be able to contribute towards complete pacification of the spirits and to a genuine national reconciliation and consolidation of the democratic state of law. In this entire process, the Government considers fundamental the cooperation of the international community, represented by the United Nations and the Troika of Observers, for the active role that it will play in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, in the assistance to the process of demobilization and the extinguishing of the military forces of UNITA, in humanitarian assistance to populations in need and in other decisive tasks for the normalization of the life of the nation. Given the importance of this agreement, the Government intends to confer due solemnity to the act of formal signature of the memorandum of understanding between the two military leaderships by organizing a ceremony in the Palacio dos Congressos on 4 April 2002, to which national and foreign entities will be invited, in particular the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Heads of the general staffs of the Armed Forces of the Troika of Observers, neighbouring countries, countries of the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries (CPLP) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Nigeria and Gabon.
