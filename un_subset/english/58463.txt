Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 5. During the interactive dialogue, 43 delegations made statements. Recommendations made during the dialogue are found in section II of the present report. A. Presentation by the State under review 6. At the 3rd meeting, the delegation of Mongolia, headed by the State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Damdin Tsogtbaatar, began its presentation of the national report by stating that the Government considered the universal periodic review as a unique opportunity to share Mongolia's experience in the human rights area with States and to learn from international best practices. Although over the past two decades Mongolia had made great strides in introducing and genuinely institutionalizing human rights, the Government recognized the need for further improvements. The delegation expressed the Government's commitment to participating actively in the review process and devoting its efforts to implementing proposals and recommendations of the Council. 7. The delegation stated that human rights and freedoms had been set out in the 1992 Constitution, and Mongolia had attached significant importance to protecting the rights and freedoms of its citizens and establishing a political and legal environment for the effective enjoyment of those rights and freedoms. Mongolia was party to the core human rights instruments; it had placed priority on empowering its national human rights institutions; Parliament had adopted the National Action Programme on Human Rights in 2003; and the Committee on the National Action Programme had been established to coordinate the day-to-day implementation of the Programme. 8. The national report had been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and had been prepared by a working group established by a decree of the Prime Minister. The Working Group had held numerous consultations with the National Human Rights Commission, relevant experts and non-governmental organizations. In addition, a tripartite consultative process comprising the Government, the United Nations Development Programme and civil society organizations had taken place in February 2010. 9. Mongolia, while providing specific protection of civil and political rights, was also committed to promoting and protecting economic, social and cultural rights. The Government's actions were also focused on the rights of persons with disabilities and of citizens with monthly incomes lower than the national average. In addition, protecting the rights of national minorities was a priority of Government action, as it implemented non-discriminatory policies and legislation concerning the rights of national minorities. 10. The Law on the National Human Rights Commission had been adopted on 7 December 2000 by Parliament, and the independent Commission had begun its activities in February 2001. 11. While Mongolia had maintained capital punishment de jure, the President had declared a moratorium on the use of the death penalty in January 2010 and had indicated that the moratorium should constitute the first step towards its abolition. Accession to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was being considered in Parliament. 12. The Government had focused on protecting women's and children's rights by putting in place necessary national programmes. In 2010, the Government had signed the Agreement on Cooperation to Combat Trafficking in Persons with the Macao Special Administrative Region, anticipating that the agreement would lead to more efficient bilateral cooperation aimed at facilitating better prevention of human trafficking, as well as stronger protection and the smoother return and reintegration of trafficking victims. 13. Owing to global warming and climate change, the following factors had deteriorated living conditions: the glaciers were receding, surface water was drying up, vegetation was decreasing, water was becoming more mineralized, soil erosion was increasing, and desertification was spreading. In 2010, a new National Programme to Combat Desertification and a water programme had been approved. Natural disasters such as dzud disasters, blizzards and storms had also affected the right of herding households to a healthy and safe environment. In that context, in 2009 the Parliament had adopted the State Policy on Herders to improve herders' living conditions and promote their right to a healthy and safe environment. 14. Health-care services were provided to all citizens, without any discrimination. The Government had approved the Action Plan for 2008 - 2012, which set the objectives for improvements in health care, and a private insurance system had been introduced. 15. Mongolia's Millennium Development Goals, which had been approved by Parliament in 2005, included fundamental gender equality objectives, such as eliminating gender disparity at all levels of education, increasing by up to 50 per cent the number of women in wage employment in non-agricultural sectors, and expanding by up to 30 percent the number of women in the national Parliament no later than 2015. The participation of women in the decision-making process was still insufficient. Although the number of female candidates was steadily increasing, their number in Parliament was actually dropping. Mongolia's view was that the percentage of women candidates should be increased. Parliament was scheduled to consider a draft law on gender equality initiated by the Government. 16. The Government had been working to implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto, and its Action Plan 2008-2012 included such objectives as providing persons with disabilities with standard facilities, as well as opportunities for a comfortable lifestyle. The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare had sought to expand its cooperation with non-governmental organizations through the publication and distribution of Braille books for blind persons, and by raising public awareness about the need to ensure the participation of persons with disabilities in social life. 17. While noting many challenges, including poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, and air pollution in the capital city, the delegation stated that the Government had the necessary political will and would continue to overcome them with the support of its people and the solidarity of other countries. The Government had been trying to strike a balance between economic growth and human rights, and to utilize more equitably and more effectively the increasing wealth derived from mining. 18. While noting the fact that periodic reports had been regularly submitted to the treaty bodies and follow-up information forwarded to Special Rapporteurs, the delegation acknowledged the need to further improve the quality of such reports. 19. The delegation expressed the Government's belief that the goals of the universal periodic review could be achieved only through the active participation of and constructive dialogue among all States and non-governmental organizations; it also expressed its readiness to work with all partners to promote and protect human rights in Mongolia. 20. In response to the advance question on the abolition of the death penalty, the delegation reported that the Government supported the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The relevant standing committee of Parliament had been discussing whether Parliament should finally ratify it. If Parliament responded positively, draft amendments to all legislation regulating the death penalty, including the Law on the State Secret, would be formulated. 21. Responding to an advance question, the delegation referred to the 2008 amendment to the Criminal Code that had altered the definition of the term "torture" in line with the Convention against Torture. Moreover, as a result of the amendment, any official involved in an investigation would be prosecuted and punished under the Code if he or she tortured, or took cruel, inhuman or degrading measures against, a suspect in order to obtain information or a confession. a working group had been studying the possibility of the ratification by Mongolia of the Optional Protocol to the Convention. 22. The delegation stated that there no data had been recorded regarding the allegation of discrimination based on sexual orientation against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. There had been regular supervision by the Prosecutor's Office on this issue, and an Open-Door Day was held each month in order to receive individuals' complaints and requests. Support was provided for the participation of advocates in the process of interrogating suspects and prosecuted persons. The Government planned to conduct a survey on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons and to record their needs and requests, which would make it possible to identify areas for possible legal amendments. In addition, an association of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons had been registered. 23. Regarding the question concerning the period of pre-trial detention, the delegation reported that the 2007 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code had decreased the period of pre-trial detention, which was based on the severity of the crime and ranged from one month to a maximum of 24 months. 24. The delegation explained that, under the Labour Law, an employer should not ask questions pertaining to the private life, marital status, sexual orientation or pregnancy of an employee unless such questions were related to the work or duties to be performed. There were no cases or data regarding the firing or discharge of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons from their work, and the relevant laws prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. 25. The Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor had implemented a project to support and reintegrate street children into society through music and culture. A cash benefit system, aimed at meeting the basic needs of families and children who had the lowest household income, was provided for in a social welfare law that had been submitted to Parliament for discussion. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 26. A number of delegations thanked Mongolia for its cooperation with the universal periodic review mechanism and commended the delegation for the constructive dialogue initiated with civil society during the preparation of its national report, as well as the comprehensive presentation of the national report during the working group. 27. Algeria welcomed the establishment of various human rights protection mechanisms, including the National Action Programme of the Human Rights Committee. Algeria noted Mongolia's adherence to most international human rights instruments and the moratorium on the death penalty. It noted the difficulties faced by the country in improving public health and education. Algeria made recommendations. 28. Morocco stated that it had observed Mongolia's positive developments and the Government's efforts to build a democratic country. It welcomed Mongolia's actions regarding the protection of the rights of minorities and the creation of legal aid centres. Morocco also welcomed the efforts to ensure the protection of disabled persons, the adoption of the law on the protection of child rights, and the Programme on Gender Equality. Morocco took note of Mongolia's efforts in the areas of health, education, employment and the reform of the electoral system. Morocco reiterated its appeal to the international community to support Mongolia's democratic process. 29. The Russian Federation noted with appreciation the progress made by Mongolia in acceding to international human rights treaties and in providing basic free education and free medical care, as well as the existence of the National Action Plan for Human Rights and the national human rights institution. It also noted the moratorium on the death penalty and the country's acknowledgement of problems and challenges in its national report and presentation. The Russian Federation made a recommendation. 30. Indonesia was encouraged to learn that, in recent years, Mongolia had established both a national human rights commission and a National Action Plan for Human Rights. It also highlighted efforts and progress made on gender equality and the enhancement of women's and children's rights.

Hungary noted with satisfaction that the Government had drafted a law on gender equality that included a definition of direct and indirect discrimination. It welcomed the ratification of a wide range of human rights treaties, but deemed it necessary to further strengthen the protection of human rights at the national level. Hungary expressed concerns about article 44 (1) of the Criminal Code, which might lead to impunity for law enforcement officials. Hungary made recommendations. 39. Cuba noted that Mongolia had included in its Constitution the right to a safe and healthy environment and had adopted more than 30 legislative instruments on the issue. With regard to health and education, the Government had adopted measures to extend related services to the highest number of persons possible. Measures had been adopted to combat and eliminate discrimination, especially gender discrimination, and other initiatives, including the National Strategy for Children and the National Programme on Strengthening Child Development and Protection, also deserved to be highlighted.

Norway also noted the recent rise in nationalism, which had resulted in cases involving discriminatory criminal acts, and referred to incidents of discrimination against minorities, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. Norway referred to the current discussion on possible accession to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Optional Protocol thereto. Norway made recommendations. 45. Azerbaijan noted positively the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in April 2010. It also noted the increasing level of cooperation with special procedures, including the Special Rapporteur on Torture, with positive results such as the inclusion of the notion of torture in the Criminal Code. Azerbaijan noted that Mongolia was suffering from climate-change-related effects. It welcomed measures taken for the advancement of women's rights, but noted that human trafficking was on the rise. Azerbaijan made recommendations. 46. The United Kingdom welcomed the recent submission of reports by Mongolia to treaty bodies. It expressed concern about the absence of a definition of torture that met international standards. It expressed its hope that Mongolia would consider the recommendations on the improvement of governance and transparency. It asked what legislative measures would be taken to abolish the death penalty and prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation. The United Kingdom made recommendations. 47. The delegation stated that the issue of accession of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights had been debated in the Standing Committee on Foreign Policy and National Security of Parliament. The delegation expected positive results. 48. Regarding to the issue of timely reporting to the United Nations treaty bodies, the delegation stressed the Government's strong commitment to improving the quality of its reports to them. The time constraints, the necessary qualifications and the availability of accurate information remained major challenges in the reporting process. The Government had recently adopted the rules for timely reporting to international instruments. 49. The delegation reiterated that the Government regarded addressing the issue of human trafficking as a high priority. The Criminal Code had been amended to include the crime of human trafficking in order to prosecute perpetrators. However, problems remained to be addressed, including the lack of reporting of cases involving human trafficking. A new law on combating human trafficking was in the process of being drafted, in order to punish perpetrators and protect the rights of victims. The establishment of a national preventive mechanism was planned. A number of projects had been implemented, with the assistance of the international community and national non-governmental organizations, to effectively address the problem of human trafficking. 50. The Constitution prohibited discrimination on all grounds, including sexual orientation, and any law proved to be inconsistent with the Constitution should be amended to bring it into line with that document. Thus, any form of discrimination was unlawful. However, traditional stereotypes existed in society, and therefore the Government acknowledged the need for greater efforts in terms of public awareness activities and training to change persistent attitudes in society. 51. The delegation stated that the issue of poverty was one of the serious obstacles hindering the enjoyment of the socio-economic rights of the population. Therefore, the Government had continued to place top priority on poverty alleviation, while pursuing swift economic development. The expected rapid economic growth would provide better means to address poverty and create new job opportunities. 52. Regarding domestic violence, appropriate legislation was in place to address the issue. However, problems remained in practice. Police officers did not always attach sufficient importance to the issue, often considering it a domestic and private matter. Victims often failed to file complaints against perpetrators. The Government had continued to work to address those problems, including through the public awareness campaign, to shape a culture of intolerance towards domestic violence. 53. Efforts had been made to improve the relevant legislation, and a number of programmes had been implemented to address the needs of persons with disabilities. The access of persons with disabilities to public office needed to be further addressed. A lack of knowledge about the rights of persons with disabilities had been observed, and thus the Government would continue to enhance those measures to address the problem. 54. The delegation stated that, with a view to addressing nutritional issues and providing access to a variety of foods, the Government had introduced a programme to revive land cultivation, which had already produced good results. 55. While noting that Mongolia was party to main international human rights instruments, Turkey inquired whether the country was considering adhering to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrants Workers and Members of their Families. Turkey welcomed the establishment of legal aid centres in all provinces and the National Programme on the Promotion of Persons with Disabilities, and asked for further information in that regard. Turkey noted the high school and university enrolment rates and encouraged Mongolia to raise awareness about birth registration. Turkey stated that Mongolia should be supported by international organizations in combating human trafficking. Turkey made a recommendation. 56. Italy commended Mongolia for the moratorium on the death penalty announced by the President in January 2010, and welcomed its participation in the International Commission against the Death Penalty. Italy noted with concern that corporal punishment was still being used and that children were increasingly involved in hazardous labour. Italy made recommendations. 57. The Republic of Korea recognized the considerable progress made in promoting human rights and the efforts to ratify international conventions and improve domestic institutions on human rights. It hoped that the Gender Equality Law would soon be enacted and encouraged more rigorous enforcement of existing laws. It welcomed steps taken to enhance the political rights of citizens and stated that further consideration should be given to the election rights of vulnerable groups. The Republic of Korea made a recommendation. 58. The Czech Republic welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty. It made recommendations. 59. New Zealand expressed concern at the reported cases of torture and the excessive use of force by the police. New Zealand welcomed the moratorium on the use of the death penalty in 2010. It expressed concern at the lack of legislation on violence against women. New Zealand made recommendations. 60. The United States expressed concern over discrimination against women and girls and the fact that the level of domestic violence remained high, but was encouraged by increasing rates of prosecution and conviction for child abuse, domestic violence, rape and incest. It also expressed concern at the discrimination based on disabilities, human trafficking and the difficulties faced by religious minorities in registering and building places of worship. The United States made recommendations. 61. Pakistan noted efforts made in promoting and protecting human rights, as reflected in the ratification of seven core international human rights instruments. Pakistan welcomed the fact that Mongolia held regular informal human rights training courses for the population and asked for additional information in that regard. It also asked for further information about the child protection system entitled "Friend 19-79". Pakistan noted the environmental challenges faced by Mongolia. Pakistan made recommendations. 62. Paraguay believed that it was important that Mongolia give priority to protecting the human rights of national minorities, and asked how international cooperation could help the country in that regard and how the Government was being supported, especially in the implementation of public policies. Paraguay, a landlocked country like Mongolia, referred to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, indicating that Mongolia's vulnerability was heightened by its geographic location. That issue could be tackled as part of increasing regional cooperation within the framework of Millennium Development Goal 8. 63. Argentina noted the moratorium on the death penalty and the draft law to ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It noted the efforts made on gender matters and asked about measures to ensure equal pay and measures regarding domestic violence and penalizing marital rape. Argentina also asked about legislative measures to combat child labour and to raise the minimum age for employment. Argentina made recommendations. 64. Spain recognized progress made in the field of human rights since the adoption of the 1992 Constitution, as well the ratification of most international human rights instruments.

Slovenia made recommendations. 68. Ghana welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty. It echoed the concerns expressed by the Special Rapporteur on Torture regarding the definition of torture, which was not in line with the Convention against Torture, and the use of evidence obtained from torture in legal proceedings. Ghana noted that Mongolia had established the National Committee for Gender Equality in 2005, but echoed concerns expressed by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women about the lack of visibility and resources of the Committee. Ghana made recommendations. 69. The Netherlands commended Mongolia for its moratorium on the death penalty and expressed hope that it would lead to abolition. The Netherlands referred to concerns expressed by the Special Rapporteur on Torture about the continuing use of torture and the legal definition of torture, which was not in line with the Convention against Torture. Netherlands commended Mongolia for the establishment of a centre for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, but expressed concerns about reported incidents of harassment against such persons. The Netherlands made recommendations. 70. Japan expressed appreciation for the fact that the 1992 Constitution provided for protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. It asked about the implementation of the United Nations Action Plan (2005 - 2009) for the World Programme for Human Rights Education and about measures to address traditional discriminatory practices related to the roles and responsibilities of women in the family and in society.

Nepal noted with appreciation that human rights were guaranteed under the Constitution and through specific laws and regulations. The establishment of the National Human Rights Commission was a praiseworthy step. As a landlocked country, Nepal acknowledged Mongolia's enormous development challenges. It commended the measures adopted to protect the environment and mitigate the effects of climate change. Nepal also welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty and encouraged Mongolia to move towards abolition. 73. Republic of Moldova congratulated Mongolia on having a National Human Rights Commission with "A" status, on the National Action Programme for Human Rights and on the recent moratorium on the death penalty. It expressed appreciation for the electoral law amendments and asked for information about the General Election Commission.

It noted the draft Law on Gender Equality and asked about challenges in that regard. It echoed concerns over foster care and adoption, and encouraged Mongolia to combat human trafficking through prevention and assistance measures. 74. Bangladesh identified the prevalence of poverty in Mongolia as one of the greatest challenges. It noted that Mongolia was prone to natural disasters, which, together with desertification and climate change, had negative impacts on the population's enjoyment of human rights. Bangladesh noted with appreciation the provisions relating to human rights in the 1992 Constitution, the existence of a National Human Rights Commission with "A" status and the high primary school and higher education enrolment rates. Bangladesh made recommendations. 75. Kyrgyzstan stated that over the past 18 years, Mongolia had attached great importance to promoting the rights and freedoms of its citizens, and had created a political and legal environment in which human rights could thrive. In addition, Mongolia had been promoting rights and freedoms through cooperation with other democratic systems. Kyrgyzstan referred to the strong institutional structure for human rights protection, including the National Committee within the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs, headed by the Prime Minister, whose main task was coordinating the human-rights-related activities of State authorities. Kyrgyzstan called on Mongolia to take further efforts to strengthen the national human rights potential in order to guarantee the cultural and social rights of its population. 76. Ukraine welcomed the adoption of national action programmes for human rights. It shared the concern of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women over the lack of measures to eliminate discrimination against women with regard to access to health, employment and participation in political and public life, and the concern of the Committee on the Rights of the Child about the social exclusion of children with disabilities. Ukraine made a recommendation. 77. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed appreciation for Mongolia's efforts and achievements in the promotion and protection of human rights, notably with regard to the right to a healthy and safe environment, ownership, employment, education and health care. The Islamic Republic of Iran made recommendations. 78. The delegation noted that a number of important issues related to the human rights system had been raised. The issue of human rights training at secondary schools had been debated at the meeting of the Committee on the National Action Programme, specifically how to integrate the human rights programme into a comprehensive approach, including a human rights culture in the education system as a whole. Interaction among students and teachers as well as teaching materials seemed noteworthy elements of that approach. The delegation expressed the view that human rights issues had already been covered by the education system but that a comprehensive and consistent approach was still needed. 79. As to the issue of the legal framework applicable to foreign residents, Mongolia had had a discriminatory system for foreign investors in the past, which had recently been changed through the establishment of parity between local and foreign investors. Visa requirements were very liberal, and visas could be obtained at the airport. 80. Referring to the incident in July 2008, the delegation stated that, although Mongolia had always been proud of its peaceful democratic transition, the protest against the election results had revealed that it should make further efforts in that regard and that the loss of five lives was unacceptable. In addition to the normal legal due process, the parliamentary human rights subcommittee had held a public hearing on the 1 July event and had publicly interviewed police officers and the protesters. 81. Regarding the number of street children, the delegation acknowledged that it remained a persistent issue, and the Government continued to strive to address it. The delegation stated that the issue was the result of poverty and described positive trends as well as efforts to establish orphanages to care for such children. Commending international aid as helpful in the establishment of orphanages, the delegation expressed the view that a long-term solution needed to be found and that the Government needed to allocate greater resources to solve the problem. 82. Addressing the pollution situation of the capital city, the delegation stated that, owing to climate change, many herders who had lost animals had had to move to Ulaanbaatar city, which had been overloaded in terms of infrastructure as a result of the increased population. The Government had designed various programmes to provide housing, but 40 per cent of approximately 1 million people still lived in traditional dwellings and burned coal in winter. As a result, the city environment was very polluted in winter. The solution was to build more modern, convenient and affordable housing, which would not be easy. Water pollution was due to the increased number of new factories and had raised serious concerns. The Government had tightened environment controls and had tried to make polluters pay for the costs related to pollution. The Government was committed to continuing to strive to resolve the issue of air pollution. 83. Regarding the phenomenon whereby the number of women in Parliament was decreasing although the number of women candidates was increasing, the delegation stated that there had been an internal quota policy requiring a political party to have 30 per cent women candidates. Parliament had also taken measures such as the draft Law on Gender Equality. II. Conclusions and/or recommendations 84.
