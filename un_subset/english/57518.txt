I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under the agenda items entitled "Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and their implications for international peace, security and development", "The situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan" and "Elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance", and of the Security Council. (Signed) Agshin Mehdiyev Ambassador Permanent Representative Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan According to the reports circulated by the mass media outlets of the Republic of Armenia, the so-called "elections" to the "local self-governing bodies" are being arranged to take place in the Daghlyq Garabagh (Nagorno Karabakh) region of the Republic of Azerbaijan on 18 September 2011. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan reiterates in this regard that the unrecognized separatist regime in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan represents nothing but an illegal structure established by the Republic of Armenia on the basis of ethnic cleansing of these territories from Azerbaijani population. The so-called "elections" are conducted in order to camouflage the annexation policy of Armenia and are aimed at consolidation of the results of the continued occupation of the internationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan. The Republic of Azerbaijan calls upon the Armenian side to stop its destructive illegal steps, which do not have any prospects, and instead to demonstrate goodwill and take a constructive position in the negotiation process in order to find an early and durable solution to the conflict on the basis of the norms and principles of international law.
