Thirteenth session New York, 26-30 April 2004 * Submission of the document was delayed owing to consultations needed with the Chairman of the Editorial Committee of the Commission and other members of the Commission. Outline of the training manual on the Preparation of a Submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf* 1. The Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, in collaboration with Harald Brakke and Galo Carrera, co-coordinators, is in the process of drafting a training manual on the preparation of a submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf under article 76 of and Annex II to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The two coordinators, who are members of the Commission, prepared a master plan for the manual and invited on a widely representative basis, a number of qualified experts from both within and outside the Commission to participate in its preparation. The coordinators themselves have prepared some of the modules. 2. The training manual is designed to assist coastal States, particularly developing States, in the preparation of data and other material concerning the outer limits of the continental shelf in areas where those limits extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. As such, it will be of invaluable assistance in building the capacity of developing coastal States to fulfil their obligations to make submissions to the Commission. 3. The goals of the training manual to be used in the delivery of the course based on the outline prepared by the Commission (CLCS/24), include: :: To enable the technical staff of a coastal State to gain an in-depth understanding of the full procedure that must be followed in order to determine the outer limits of the State's continental shelf beyond 200 M, so that those limits may become final and binding :: To provide an outline of the technical and scientific data that will be required to prepare the submission :: To raise the awareness of technical and other staff of a coastal State of how different fields of expertise will have to be called upon in order to satisfy the technical and scientific requirements of article 76 of UNCLOS and of the Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission (CLCS/11 and Add.1) :: To train the technical staff of the coastal State through practical exercises in preparing a submission on the outer limits of the continental shelf 4. The insight gained by the State's technical staff through such a course will hopefully enable the national Government: :: To assess the complexity and cost of its own case in the light of its time limit for making a submission to the Commission :: To decide on the institutional framework within the State to organize and prepare its submission to the Commission :: To assess how much of the submission may be prepared by its own staff and how much additional expertise and know-how, if any, it may still need to import 5. The training manual under preparation by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea is based on the outline for a five-day training course for delineation of the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles and for preparation of a submission of a coastal State to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was adopted by the Commission at its eighth session on 1 September 2000 (CLCS/24). 6. The training manual is an integral document based on the Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission. It comprises an introduction and thirty modules, which incorporate both lectures and practical laboratories. The introduction to the training manual provides information about the origin, framework and objectives of the manual.

It contains a brief introduction to scientific concepts of the continental margin with its shelf, slope and rise. Module 2: Introduction to article 76 (Part II) provides a commentary to article 76, paragraphs 1 to 3. It describes the fundamental features which must be identified in order to implement article 76, such as the foot of the continental slope and the four rules and their application. It describes the consequences in terms of the Convention resulting from the categorization of various types of seafloor highs. It provides a commentary on article 76, paragraphs 4 to 10, and a description of the test of appurtenance. Module 3: Introduction to the Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the CLCS presents the purpose and summarizes the contents of the Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission. It includes a description and an elaboration of the geodetic, geological, geophysical and hydrographic methodologies stipulated in article 76 for the establishment of the outer limit of the continental shelf, using such criteria as determination of the foot of the continental slope, sediment thickness and types of seafloor highs. Module 4: Modus Operandi of the Commission, describes the flow of internal procedures followed by the Commission and its subcommissions during the consideration of a submission and the preparation of the recommendations of the subcommission to the Commission and the Commission to the State. It describes the actions that may be taken by the coastal State following the recommendations of the Commission.

Module 14: Maximum change in the gradient III defines high-order analytic and numerical derivatives. It shows the nature and value of two- and three-dimensional estimations of the foot of the continental slope and their error estimation. Module 15: Evidence to the contrary to the general rule I describes the scientific classification of the continental margins of the world into three major classes: convergent, divergent and sheared margins. In more detail, it describes three types of convergent margins: accretionary, poor or non-accretionary, and destructive. Module 16: Evidence to the contrary to the general rule II describes more details of the sheared margins and the divergent margins, including the rifted non-volcanic and rifted volcanic margins. It presents a commentary on article 76, paragraph 4 (b), and presents geological and geophysical evidence relevant to the problem of evidence to the contrary to the general rule regarding the establishment of the foot of the continental slope. The descriptions of the different types of continental margin contained in modules 15 and 16 are made with a view to be of relevance also to modules 19 and 27. Module 17: Evidence to the contrary to the general rule III discusses the determination of the foot of the continental slope from evidence to the contrary to the general rule at the different types of convergent, divergent and sheared margins. It also contains a review of the type of consideration and discussion of evidence provided in support in any given case.
