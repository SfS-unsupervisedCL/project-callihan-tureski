Fifty-seventh session Item 159 of the provisional agenda* Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country Letter dated 18 July 2002 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Iraq to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 18 July 2002 from Mr. Naji Sabri, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq, referring to the fact that the United States authorities did not grant entry visas to the members of the Iraqi delegation that was to have participated in the work of the tenth session of the Preparatory Commission for the International Criminal Court. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly under item 159 of the provisional agenda. (Signed) Abdul Munim Al-Kadhe Chargé d'affaires a.i. I should like to inform you that the United States authorities did not grant visas to enter the country to the members of the Iraqi delegation that was to have participated in the tenth session of the Preparatory Commission for the International Criminal Court, held in New York from 1 to 12 July 2002. This denied them access to United Nations Headquarters and prevented them from performing their assigned role and from participating in meetings convened by the Organization or held under its auspices, thus violating section 11 of the Headquarters Agreement concluded by the United Nations and the United States of America on 26 June 1947. As I register with you the protest of the Government of the Republic of Iraq at this serious violation by the United States, I request you to intervene with the United States authorities with a view to inducing them to honour the obligations they have assumed with respect to the United Nations and to desist from imposing impediments to the participation of Iraqi delegations in United Nations meetings. I request you to have this letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly. (Signed) Naji Sabri Minister for Foreign Affairs
