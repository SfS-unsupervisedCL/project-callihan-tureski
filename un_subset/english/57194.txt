[Original: Spanish] Special Declaration of the Minsters for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-People's Trade Agreement (ALBA-TCP) on the situation in Libya and Syria The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-People's Trade Agreement (ALBA-TCP), gathered in Caracas, Venezuela, on 9 September 2011, recalling the Special Communiqué of the Political Council of 4 March 2011 and the Special Communiqué of the Social Ministerial Council of 19 March 2011, condemn the intervention of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Libya, and the illegal military aggression carried out under a United Nations Security Council resolution, which opportunistically exploits the internal political conflict in the country. They denounce the NATO military operation for regime change in Libya, conducted under the doctrine of preventive war, and the manipulation of the United Nations to suit its geopolitical and economic interests in violation of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). They demand the immediate and unconditional cessation of NATO bombings and military intervention in Libyan territory. They deplore the fact that NATO has disregarded the persistent efforts of the African Union to seek a peaceful solution to the internal conflict in Libya based on dialogue. They further deplore the complicity of various major international media outlets, which have sided with those interested in aggression and have consciously distorted information on what is happening in Libya. They sound an extremely urgent warning about the danger that similar action will be taken against Syria, exploiting the political difficulties that Arab nation is undergoing. They reiterate their firmest commitment to the right of self-determination of the peoples of Libya and Syria. They reject in the strongest terms any attempt to turn Libya into a NATO or Security Council protectorate. Desiring to help support efforts to achieve the peace demanded by the majority of the world's peoples, the Ministers agree to undertake the following actions: :: Encourage discussion in the General Assembly on the dangerous precedents that have been set with regard to Libya, and on protection of the sovereign rights of that Arab nation in Africa with a view to guaranteeing that Libya will not become a NATO or Security Council protectorate; :: Promote the establishment of a Working Group of the General Assembly to investigate and monitor the use of Libya's frozen financial reserves and report to the Assembly on its findings and conclusions; :: Call on the international community to promote an initiative to investigate crimes perpetrated by NATO in Libya which have caused harm to the Libyan people, including loss of life and the destruction of the country's infrastructure. Compile a list of instances of media manipulation and lies promoted by the imperialists to justify their attack on the Libyan people; :: Request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to be fully transparent with and strictly accountable to Member States concerning his actions with respect to Libya and Syria, stress that his actions must be taken under the mandates agreed to by the General Assembly before further interventions in Libya are conducted, and request the Secretary-General to hold a meeting with the ALBA-TCP countries to discuss the situation in Libya; :: Endorse a central role for the African Union in efforts to bring peace to Libya; :: Express its opposition to Libya's seat in the United Nations being occupied by an illegitimate transitional faction or authority imposed by foreign interventionism and thus promote an in-depth debate in the Credentials Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations in order to prevent Libya's seat from being filled until such time as it has a Government that has been legally constituted, without foreign intervention, and is a free and sovereign expression of the will of the Libyan people; :: Propose to the Syrian Government that an ALBA-TCP mission composed of high-level representatives or Ministers for Foreign Affairs be sent to Damascus and if that proposal is accepted, report on this initiative to Latin American and Caribbean countries through the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Central American Integration System (SICA) and the unified forum of the Latin American and Caribbean Summit (CALC) and the Rio Group, and invite those who wish to join this initiative to participate; :: Promote a debate in the Coordinating Bureau of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries on the dangers looming over Syria; :: Support, together with the Non-Aligned Countries that are members of the Security Council, the draft resolution on Syria put forward by the Russian Federation and China; :: Transmit this Declaration to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and request that it be circulated among States Members of the United Nations as an official document of the General Assembly.
