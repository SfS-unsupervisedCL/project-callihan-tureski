Statement by the President of the Security Council At the 5249th meeting of the Security Council, held on 23 August 2005, in connection with the Council's consideration of the item entitled "The situation in Afghanistan", the President of the Security Council made the following statement on behalf of the Council: "The Security Council welcomes the progress in the preparations for the parliamentary (Wolesi Jirga) and provincial council elections scheduled for 18 September 2005, including the compilation of the final candidate list and updating of voter registration, and encourages all Afghan participants, especially the candidates and their supporters, to work constructively to ensure that the ongoing electoral campaigns are conducted peacefully, in an environment free of intimidation, and that the elections can be held successfully. The Council calls upon the international community to extend additional financial assistance in order to fill the gap of USD $29.6 million for these elections. "The Security Council expresses grave concern about the increased attacks by the Taliban, Al-Qaida and other extremist groups in Afghanistan over the past few months. The Council condemns the attempts to disrupt the political process by terrorist acts or other forms of violence in Afghanistan. The Council, in this regard, endorses the effort of the Afghan government, with the support of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and the Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) coalition, within their respective responsibilities, to improve the safety and stability of the country. "The Security Council also stresses the importance of continued cooperation and increased dialogue between neighbouring states and the Afghan government to promote regional development and the long-term peace and stability of Afghanistan. "The Security Council notes the progress made to date, in particular in Security Sector Reform, and in this regard welcomes the completion of the disarmament of the Afghan Military Forces (AMF). The Council expresses its strong view that the international community must maintain a high level of commitment to assist Afghanistan in addressing its remaining challenges, including the security situation, disbandment of illegal armed groups, the production and trafficking of drugs, development of Afghan government institutions, acceleration of justice sector reform, promotion and protection of human rights, and sustainable economic and social development. "The Security Council welcomes the desire of the international community and the Afghan government to agree a new framework for international engagement beyond the completion of the Bonn political process. The Council expresses, in this regard, its readiness to review, based on the report of the Secretary-General to be submitted in accordance with its resolution 1589 (2005), and in the light of consultations the United Nations will have with the Government of Afghanistan and all concerned international actors, the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) after the completion of the electoral process, in order to allow the United Nations to continue to play a vital role in the post-Bonn period. The Council is also ready to consider the renewal of the mandate of ISAF prior to its expiration, upon the request of the Government of Afghanistan."
