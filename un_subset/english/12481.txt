INTRODUCTION a. Mandate The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), at the first part of its thirteenth session, agreed to further consider, at the second part of that session (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/10, para. 37): Guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol; Guidelines for the review under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol; Possible elements for a draft decision or draft decisions on Articles 5.1, 5.2, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. The SBSTA invited the Chairman to further develop the draft texts relating to guidelines under Articles 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol and methodologies for adjustments under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2000/10/Add.3, taking into account views expressed by Parties at the first part of its thirteenth session, in additional submissions and at informal consultations held in Bonn, from 6 to 8 October 2000) with a view to recommending a draft decision or draft decisions on these matters to the Conference of the Parties at its sixth session, for adoption by to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session. B. Scope of the note This note contains the text elaborated by the Chairman in accordance with the above mandate. In preparing this text, the Chairman has drawn on the views expressed at the first part of the thirteenth session, in the submissions from Parties, including document FCCC/SBSTA/2000/MISC.7/Add.2, and during extensive bilateral and group consultations, including informal consultations held in Bonn, Germany, from 6 to 8 October 2000. The Chairman hopes that this text, which has been further developed, will be a useful addition to the document already available (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/10/Add.3), which will remain on the table. In view of the large number of issues that remain to be resolved, and the limited time available, the document has been designed by the Chairman to facilitate and advance negotiations at the second part of the thirteenth session. POSSIBLE ELEMENTS FOR A DRAFT DECISION OR DRAFT DECISIONS RELATED TO ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8 OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL This annex contains possible elements on issues related to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol that could be incorporated in a draft decision or draft decisions by the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its sixth session and in a draft decision or draft decisions to be recommended to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP) for adoption at its first session. The possible elements contained in this document relate to guidelines that are at different stages of development. Guidelines for national systems under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol were agreed upon by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice at its twelfth session (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/5). Draft guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol and draft guidelines for the review under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol are still being considered. Elements related to guidelines for national systems under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol to be incorporated in a draft COP decision The Conference of the Parties, Recalling its decisions 1/CP.3, 1/CP.4 and 8/CP.4, Noting Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol, Having considered the relevant recommendations of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, 1. Recommends that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, at its first session after the entry into force of the Protocol, adopt the attached draft decision; 2. Encourages Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) to implement the guidelines for national systems under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible with the aim of gaining experience with their implementation; 3. Urges Parties included in Annex II to the Convention to assist Annex I Parties with economies in transition, through appropriate bilateral or multilateral channels, with the implementation of the guidelines for national systems under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto Protocol to be incorporated in a draft COP/MOP1 decision The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, Recalling Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol, in particular its provision that each Party included in Annex I to the Convention shall have in place, no later than one year prior to the start of the first commitment period, a national system for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, Recognizing the importance of such national systems for the implementation of other provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, Having considered decision (-)/CP.6, adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its sixth session, 1. Adopts the guidelines for national systems under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol; 2. Urges Parties included in Annex I to the Convention to implement the guidelines as soon as possible. Noting Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol, Recalling its decisions 1/CP.3, 2/CP.3, 1/CP.4 and 8/CP.4, Recognizing the essential role of high quality greenhouse gas inventories under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, Recognizing the need for confidence in estimates of emissions by sources and removals by sinks for the purpose of ascertaining compliance with commitments under Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol, Acknowledging the importance of ensuring that anthropogenic emissions are not underestimated and that removals by sinks and base year emissions are not overestimated, Having considered the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, Recommends that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, at its first session after the entry into force of the Protocol, adopt the attached draft decision; 2. Requests the secretariat to organize a workshop prior to, and one or possibly more workshops after, the fourteenth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol with the participation of greenhouse gas inventory experts and other experts nominated to the UNFCCC roster of experts and experts involved in the preparation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The purpose of the first workshop would be to elaborate draft technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5.2, building upon submissions by Parties contained in documents FCCC/SBSTA/2000/MISC.1 and Add.1, FCCC/SBSTA/2000/MISC.7 and Add.1 as well as FCCC/TP/2000/1, for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice at its fourteenth session. At that session, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice should define more precisely the scope of the second workshop; 3. Requests the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice to complete technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol, building upon the attached draft decision and the outcome of the process described in paragraph 2 above, for consideration by the Conference of the Parties at its eighth session, with a view to recommending, at that session, such technical guidance for adoption by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session; 4. [Decides to consider relevant technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol for estimates of emissions and removals from land-use, land-use change and forestry after completion of the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on good practice guidance on this matter, with a view to recommending such technical guidance for adoption by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session.] Elements related to good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol to be incorporated in a draft COP/MOP1 decision Recalling Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol, Further recalling decisions 1/CP.3, 2/CP.3, 1/CP.4 and 8/CP.4 of the Conference of the Parties, Having considered decision (-)/CP.6 adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its sixth session, 1. Endorses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as accepted by the sixteenth session of the IPCC held in Montreal, Canada, 1 to 8 May 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance), as an elaboration of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; Decides that the good practice guidance referred to in paragraph 1 shall be used by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention in their preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories under the Kyoto Protocol; Decides that adjustments referred to in Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol should only be applied when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention are found to be incomplete and/or are calculated in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance; Decides that the calculation of adjustments shall commence only after a Party included in Annex I to the Convention has been provided with opportunities to correct any deficiencies in accordance with the time-frame and procedures set forth in the guidelines for inventory review under Article 8; 5. Decides that the adjustment procedure shall result in estimates that are conservative for the Party included in Annex I to the Convention concerned so as to ensure that emissions are not underestimated [and removals by sinks] and base year emissions are not overestimated [and, at the same time, are not unreasonably exaggerated]; 6. Emphasizes that adjustments are intended to provide an incentive for Parties to provide complete and accurate annual greenhouse gas inventories prepared in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance. Adjustments are intended to correct inventory problems in specific source categories for the purpose of accounting of the Parties' emissions and assigned amounts. Adjustments are not intended to substitute for a Party's obligation to estimate and report greenhouse gas inventories in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance; 7. Decides that adjusted estimates shall be calculated in accordance with the technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments contained in the annex to this decision. Such technical guidance shall ensure consistency and comparability and that similar methods are used for similar problems as far as possible across all inventories reviewed under Article 8 [and to ensure consistency with the base year emission estimates included in the Parties' national inventories]; 8. Decides that a Party may submit a revised estimate for a part of its [commitment period] inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied, provided that the revised estimate is submitted, at the latest, in conjunction with the inventory for the year 2012. The revised estimate will replace the adjusted estimate subject to review under Article 8 [with the authorization of [the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol or compliance committee]]. The option for a Party to submit a revised estimate for a part of its [commitment period] inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied should not prevent Parties from making best efforts to correct the problem at the time it was initially identified and in accordance with the timetable set forth in the guidelines for review under Article 8; 9. [Decides that a Party will only be rendered in non-compliance with Article 5.2 if, at any point during the commitment period, the sum of the percent difference for each year between the Party's total emissions according to its adjusted annual inventory and its submitted annual inventory, relative to the submitted inventory, exceeds [30][10][x] per cent, i.e. when ((adjusted inventory - submitted inventory)/(submitted inventory))>[0.30][0.10][x/100]].

Members of the standing group of review experts serve in their personal capacity and shall have recognized competence in areas to be reviewed under these guidelines. Experts of the standing group of review experts provide permanent service on review tasks. The constitution of the standing group of review experts shall be guided by the following principles: capacity, independence and geographical balance of their members. To provide that the above-mentioned principles are consistently applied, it shall be ensured that: Experts are selected on the basis of their own capacity; Relevant complementary training is provided to such experts; A process for certifying the competence of the experts on relevant issues is established. Funding for such experts is managed in such a way as to avoid any links between the experts and Parties providing financial resources. F. Reporting Review reports for each Annex I Party shall follow a comparable format and outline as set out in paragraph and include the specific elements described in parts II to VII of these guidelines. All review reports prepared by the expert review team should include the following elements: An introduction and summary; A description of the technical assessment of each of the elements to be reviewed according to the relevant sections on the scope of the review in parts II to VII of these guidelines, including: A description of the technical assessment of the reviewed element; A description of any potential problems in, and factors influencing, the fulfilment of commitments identified during the review; Any recommendations provided by the expert review team to solve the problems; A description of how the Annex I Party addressed the problems identified by the expert review team during the current or previous reviews [and how previous recommendations of [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] have been followed.] Any resulting questions of implementation of the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol [thereby distinguishing between mandatory and non-mandatory elements]; Possible recommendations by the expert review team on the conduct of the review in subsequent years, including which parts may be considered in depth; Information on any other issue of concern that has been identified and deemed relevant by the expert review team; A description of the information and the sources of information used in the formulation of the final report. [The report should also list problems where, for example: A problem was listed in a previous review, [the COP/MOP or the compliance committee] made a recommendation and the expert review team is of the view that the Annex I Party did not take sufficient action to follow that recommendation; Unsatisfactory additional information and responses were provided to the expert review team's questions by the Annex I Party, resulting in outstanding questions.] Option 1: For the review prior to the commitment period, for each Annex I Party, a single report on the review of the elements described in paragraph (a) to [(g)][(h)] above, [and the national communication, i.e. the element specified in paragraph (h) above] shall be produced. Option 2: For the review prior to the commitment period, for each Annex I Party, a [single] report on the review of the elements described in paragraph (a) to (g) above and a separate report on the review of the national communication, i.e. the element specified in paragraph (h) above, shall be produced. For the annual review, for each Annex I Party, a report on the annual review of the elements in paragraph shall be produced in accordance with parts II, III and IV [, V and VI] of these guidelines. A status report after the initial check of the annual inventory shall be prepared separately. [For the annual compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts, for each Annex I Party, a report shall be produced.] For the periodic review, for each Annex I Party, a report on the review of the national communication shall be produced. Following their completion, final review reports [, including initial checks on annual inventories and reports on the annual compilation and accounting of assigned amounts,] shall be published by the secretariat. Following their completion, final review reports [, including initial checks on annual inventories and reports on the annual compilation and accounting of assigned amounts,] shall be forwarded through the secretariat to [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] and the Party concerned. A. Purpose The purpose of the review of Annex I Parties' annual inventories is: To provide an objective, consistent, transparent, thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories for conformity with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP, and with the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7, section I; To assess if adjustments under Article 5.2 may be needed and, if so, to calculate adjustments in accordance with relevant decisions of the COP/MOP relating to Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol; To ensure that [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] have reliable information on each Annex I Party's [greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks] [compliance with Article 3 as provided for in the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7, section I]. B. General procedures The review should cover: The annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the common reporting format (CRF); Supplementary information under Article 7.1 reported according to the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7, section I, with the exception of section I.E; The annual inventory review shall consist of two elements: Initial check by the expert review team, with the assistance of the secretariat; Individual inventory review by the expert review team. The individual inventory review shall occur in conjunction with the review of assigned amount, changes in national systems, [changes in national registries], [projects under Article 6] as set out in part I of these guidelines. The base year inventory shall only be reviewed once prior to the commitment period and adjusted if appropriate. [During the commitment period, the base year inventory shall be reviewed if it has been subject to recalculation.] Each Annex I Party shall be subject to at least one incountry visit by an expert review team during the commitment period as part of its annual review. In years when an incountry visit is not conducted, the annual review should be conducted as a desk review. Incountry visits should be scheduled, planned and take place with the consent of the Annex I Party subject to review. The scheduled incountry visits of Annex I Parties shall be evenly distributed over the course of the commitment period. In years when an incountry visit is not scheduled, an expert review team can request an incountry visit if it believes, based on the findings of the desk review, that such a visit is necessary to allow for fuller investigation of a potential problem that the team has identified, subject to the consent of the Annex I Party. The expert review team shall provide a rationale for the additional country visit and shall compile a list of questions and issues to be addressed during the country visit to be sent to the Annex I Party in advance of the visit. If an unscheduled incountry visit occurs, then the expert review team may recommend that a pending scheduled incountry visit is not necessary. The scheduled incountry visit may occur in conjunction with the periodic review or in a different year, in accordance with the agreement between the Annex I Party, the expert review team and the secretariat. C. Initial checks of annual inventories Scope of the review The expert review team shall conduct an initial check as a desk review to examine that each Annex I Party has submitted a consistent, complete and timely annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the common reporting format (CRF) and that data contained in the CRF are complete and in the correct format to enable subsequent review stages to occur. The initial check shall [: Identify gaps, problems or inconsistencies in the inventory data or documentation for clarification by the Annex I Party during the individual inventory review; Identify [first order] problems; Determine promptly if the submission is complete and if information has been provided in the correct format in accordance with reporting guidelines on annual inventories. The assessment of completeness, in accordance with paragraph above, will] determine if: All sources, sinks and gases included in the IPCC Guidelines and any good practice adopted by the COP/MOP are reported and any gaps explained, where gaps should include empty cells in the CRF and/or frequent resort to the notation keys NE (not estimated), NA (not available) etc. in completing the CRF; Methodologies are documented; Estimates for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion are reported using the IPCC reference approach, in addition to estimates derived using national methods; Estimates for hydrofluorocarbon, perfluorocarbon and sulphur hexafluoride emissions are reported by individual chemical species. Timing, The status report of the initial check for each Annex I Party shall be finalized [2][6][8][10][12] weeks from the submission due date to be used in the individual inventory review. The initial check for each Annex I Party shall be performed and a draft status report shall be completed within [4] weeks after the receipt of the annual inventory and sent to the Annex I Party for comment. The secretariat shall immediately notify the Annex I Party concerned of any omissions or technical format problems identified in the initial check. Any information, corrections, additional information or comments on the draft status report received from the Annex I Party within [6] weeks of the submission due date shall be subject to an initial check and shall be covered in the final status report. A delay in the submission of the annual inventory shortens the time available for the Annex I Party to comment on the draft status report. A delay in the preparation of the draft status report shall not shorten the time available for the Annex I Party to comment on the draft status report. Reporting The status report shall include, inter alia: The date of receipt of the inventory submission by the secretariat; An indication whether the annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the CRF, has been submitted; An indication whether any source category or gas of a source category is missing and, if so, an indication of the magnitude of the likely emissions of that source category or gas, [if possible] relative to the last inventory for which the review has been completed; [Unexplained apparent data inconsistencies.] D. Individual inventory reviews The individual inventory review shall, inter alia: Examine departures from the requirements of the IPCC Guidelines and the reporting guidelines on annual inventories and relevant decisions of the COP/MOP; Examine whether the IPCC good practice guidance and any other good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP was applied and documented, in particular noting the identification of key source categories, selection and use of methodologies and assumptions, development and selection of emission factors, collection and selection of activity data, reporting of consistent time-series, reporting of uncertainties related to inventory estimates and methodologies used for estimating those uncertainties; Compare emission or removal estimates, activity data, implied emission factors and any recalculations with data from previous submissions of the Annex I Party to identify any irregularities or inconsistencies; Compare the Annex I Party's activity data with relevant external authoritative sources, if feasible, and identify any inconsistencies; Assess the consistency of information in the common reporting format with that in the national inventory report; Assess the extent to which issues and questions raised by expert review teams in previous reports have been addressed and resolved; Recommend possible ways in which of improving methodologies and the reporting of inventory information. [Assess compliance with Article 3.2 and 3.14] The expert review team may use relevant technical information in the review process, such as information from international organizations and other sources. Identification of problems The individual inventory review shall identify [first order] problems, identify problems for which adjustments under Article 5.2 would be appropriate and initiate procedures for calculation of adjustments. Problems should be identified as a failure to follow agreed guidelines under Article 5.2 in preparing greenhouse gas inventories, as a failure to follow the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7, section I [and as a failure to follow agreed methodologies for estimating and reporting activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4 as adopted by the COP/MOP]. These may be further subdivided as problems of: [Implications for total aggregated inventory estimates, trends or the base year inventory, including all inventory problems that lead to overestimation of base year emissions or underestimation of emissions in the commitment period;] Transparency, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including: Inadequate documentation and description of methodologies, assumptions and recalculations; Failure to disaggregate national activity data, emission factors and other factors used in national methods at the required level; Failure to provide justifications for recalculations, references and information sources for key factors and data; Consistency, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including: Failure to provide consistent time-series in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance; [Failure of recalculations to improve accuracy or completeness;] Comparability, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including failure to use agreed reporting formats; Completeness, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including: Gaps in the inventory estimates for source categories or gases; Inventory data that do not provide full geographic coverage of sources and sinks of an Annex I Party; Failure to provide full coverage of sources in a source category; Accuracy, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including: Failure to provide estimates of uncertainties; Inappropriate estimation of uncertainties; Timeliness of submission of information, according to the time-frames established in these guidelines and relevant decisions of the COP/MOP. Problems should, to the extent possible, only be described in terms of one of the categories above. [Failure to provide information related to Article 3.2 and 3.14.] For each problem, the expert review team shall calculate, where possible, the magnitude of the part of the emissions estimate affected by the problem expressed in terms of CO2 equivalent and, where available, as a proportion of the total base year inventory. Timing The individual inventory review, including adjustment procedures, shall be concluded within one year of the due date of submission of the information to be reported under Article 7.1. The expert review team shall list all problems identified, indicating which would need an adjustment, and send this list to the Annex I Party no later than [25] weeks from the submission due date of the annual inventory, if the inventory was submitted at least [x] weeks after the submission due date. The Annex I Party shall comment on these questions within [8] weeks and, where appropriate, may provide revised estimates. The expert review team shall prepare a draft individual inventory review report, which includes, where appropriate, adjusted estimates calculated according to guidance under Article 5.2 within [6] weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed. The Annex I Party shall comment on the draft individual inventory review report and, where appropriate, on whether it accepts or rejects the adjustment within [6] weeks. The expert review team shall prepare a final individual inventory review report within [6] weeks of the receipt of the comments on the draft report. [If an Annex I Party during the above steps is able to comment earlier than in the above given time-frames, the Annex I Party may use the saved time to comment on the revised final report. A total of four additional weeks to comment may be granted to Parties whose national language is not one of the United Nations official languages.] Procedures for adjustments under Article 5.2 Adjustments referred to in Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol should only be applied when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention are found to be incomplete and/or are calculated in a way that is not consistent with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP. Adjustments shall be calculated in accordance with any guidance under Article 5.2 adopted by the COP/MOP. The procedure for the calculation of adjustments should be as follows: During the individual inventory review, the expert review team shall identify problems to which the criteria in the guidance for adjustments under Article 5.2 apply. The expert review team shall officially notify the Annex I Party of the reason why an adjustment is considered necessary and provide advice on how the problem could be corrected; The adjustment procedure should only commence after an Annex I Party has had opportunities to correct a problem and if the expert review team finds that an Annex I Party has not adequately corrected the problem through the provision of an acceptable revised estimate, in accordance with the time-frame set out in paragraph above; The expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with guidance under Article 5.2, in consultation with the Annex I Party concerned and within the time-frame set out in these guidelines; [Adjustments for any unresolved problems may not be calculated or applied, if The underlying problem is [first order]; or In total, the adjustments exceed [x] per cent of the total inventory in a particular year.] The expert review team shall officially notify the Annex I Party concerned of the calculated adjustment(s) within the time-frame set out in these guidelines. This notification shall describe the assumptions, data and methodologies used to calculate the adjustment(s), as well as the value of the adjustment(s); Within the time-frame set out in these guidelines, the Annex I Party concerned shall notify the secretariat of its intention to accept or reject the adjustment(s), with its rationale. Failure to respond by this date shall be considered as acceptance of the adjustment(s), as follows: If the Annex I Party accepts the adjustment(s), the adjusted estimate(s) shall be used for the purpose of compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts; If the Annex I Party does not accept the adjustment(s) it should send a notification to the expert review team, including its rationale, and the expert review team should send the notification along with its recommendation to [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee]. An Annex I Party may submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory of a year of the commitment period to which an adjustment was previously applied, provided that the revised estimate is submitted, at the latest, in conjunction with the inventory for the year 2012. [An Annex I Party may submit a revised estimate for a part of its base year inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied, provided that the revised estimate is submitted, at the latest, in conjunction with the inventory for the year 2012.] The revised estimate will replace the adjusted estimate subject to review under Article 8 [with the authorization of [the COP/MOP or the compliance committee]]. The option for an Annex I Party to submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied should not prevent Annex I Parties from making best efforts to correct the problem at the time it was initially identified and in accordance with the time-frame set forth in the guidelines for review under Article 8. The final individual inventory review report shall follow the outline set out in paragraph and shall include the following specific elements, where relevant: A general description of the inventory, including a description of emission trends, key sources and methodologies and a general assessment of the inventory; Identification [and classification] of inventory problems according to the categories listed in paragraph and a description of factors influencing the Annex I Party's fulfilment of its inventory-related obligations; Information on adjustments, if applicable, including, inter alia, The original estimate, if applicable; The underlying problem; The adjusted estimate; The rationale for the adjustment; The assumptions, data and methodology used to calculate the adjustment; A description of how the adjustment is conservative [and time consistent]; [The uncertainty associated with the adjustment]; The expert review team's identification of possible ways for the Annex I Party to address the underlying problem; Adjustments as a share of the total GHG inventory for the year concerned; An indication whether the adjustment was agreed upon by the Annex I Party and the expert review team. E. [Classification of first order problems Problems found by the expert review team that persist after the Annex I Party has had opportunities to correct them shall be classified. Problems shall be classified as [first order] or [other]. The following problems should be classified as [first order] and should be identified after the initial check: Failure to submit an annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the common reporting format, by the due date or within [x] weeks of the due date if, in advance, the secretariat was notified by the Annex I Party that its submission would be late; [Failure to submit estimates for a source category, as defined in chapter 7 of the IPCC good practice guidance agreed by the COP, that individually accounts for [x] per cent or more of the Annex I Party's total GHG emissions for the most recent year in the latest submitted inventory containing an estimate for the respective source category;] [Unexplained, apparent data inconsistencies, including inconsistencies with previously submitted inventories and inconsistencies between different parts of the inventory, where a particular inconsistency accounts for more than [x] per cent of the total inventory estimate;] [Failure to submit information on one or more sections provided for in the guidelines for the preparation of information required under Article 7, section I;]. The following problems should be classified as [first order] and should be identified during the individual inventory review: The sum of the percentage difference for each year between the Party's adjusted annual inventory and its submitted annual inventory, relative to the submitted inventory, exceeds [x]; Gaps in the inventory estimates for source categories (or lack in coverage of sources) would lead to adjustments altogether exceeding [5] per cent of the total submitted inventory; (Diagrams have been added for illustrative purposes only.) The proportion of the inventory subject to an adjustment is more than [x] per cent of the total GHG inventory for the most recent inventory for which a review has been completed; Data inconsistencies, including inconsistencies with previously submitted inventories or between different parts of the inventory, occur, where a particular inconsistency accounts for more than [x] per cent of the total inventory estimate; Methodological problems relating to inventory estimates in one or several sources categories would account altogether for more than [5] per cent of the total GHG inventory estimate for a particular year; There is repetition of either a methodological problem or a gap related to a "key source" category identified in a previous inventory; [Need for an adjustment for the same source category in three consecutive years;] [Inadequate information for one or more sections provided for in the guidelines for the preparation of information required under Article 7, section I.]] (Once the options have been agreed for the above paragraphs, it will be necessary to clarify the language; for example 'methodological' problems may need definition, it needs to be specified that percentages relate to totals of emissions from sources listed in Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol.) The purpose of the review of information on assigned amounts is to ensure that [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] have adequate information on assigned amounts. The review of information on assigned amounts shall take place in conjunction with the annual inventory review. The expert review team shall review the information on assigned amounts as a centralized desk exercise. C. Scope of the review The review of information on assigned amounts shall cover: Issuance and cancellation of assigned amounts with respect to Article [3.3, 3.4 and] 3.7, Transfers and acquisitions under Articles [4,] 6, 12 and 17; Retirement of assigned amount units; Total [holdings] of assigned amounts in the national registry; [Banked] [assigned amount units][parts of assigned amount] at the end of the true-up period in accordance with Article 3.13. The expert review team shall: Check if information is complete and submitted in accordance with the guidelines for the preparation of information required under Article 7, section I, and relevant decisions of the COP; Check that issuance of assigned amount pursuant to Article 3.7 and 3.8 is calculated in accordance with requirements under Article 7.4, is consistent with reviewed and adjusted inventory estimates, is consistent with information submitted in previous years and is serialized in conformity with procedures under Article 7.4; Crosscheck the reported information on transfers and acquisitions between Parties [and highlight any discrepancies]; [Assess the issuance and cancellation of assigned amounts under Article 3.3 and 3.4 reported in accordance with methodologies under that Article;] [Check that issuance and cancellation of assigned amount pursuant to Article 3.3 and 3.4 is calculated in accordance with requirements under Article 7.4, is consistent with reviewed and adjusted inventory estimates and is serialized in conformity with procedures under Article 7.4.] D. Timing During the review of the information on assigned amounts, the expert review team shall identify problems and shall notify the Annex I Party of the problems. The Annex I Party may correct the problems or provide additional information within the time-frame set out in these guidelines (see paragraphs to ). E. Reporting The information on the review of information on assigned amounts shall be integrated into the annual review report for each Annex I Party, which is published by the secretariat and forwarded to [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] and the Party concerned.] [PART III bis: ANNUAL COMPILATION AND ACCOUNTING OF EMISSION INVENTORIES AND ASSIGNED AMOUNTS (Without prejudice to the placement of this part, annual compilation could be a separate part of Article 8 guidelines, included in part I or in modalities for accounting of assigned amount under Article 7.4) Purpose The purpose of the annual compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts is to ensure that [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] have [adequate][thorough and comprehensive] information on emissions inventories and assigned amounts for each year of the commitment period. General procedures The annual compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts shall occur for each Annex I Party after its individual inventory and assigned amount reviews have been completed and after resolution of any compliance-related matters which affect the inventory and assigned amounts. The secretariat shall establish a database to compile and account for the emissions and assigned amount of Parties. The secretariat shall maintain a separate account for each Party included in Annex I for each commitment period. The information maintained in each Party's commitment period account shall be used for determining compliance with Article 3.1 commitments upon expiration of the true-up period. Determination of compliance shall be based on comparison of the Party's cumulative emissions over the commitment period from the sectors and source categories specified in paragraph (c) below with the Party's total assigned amount retired for the commitment period as specified in paragraph (i) below. C. Scope The secretariat shall record in each Annex I Party's account the following information in units of CO2 equivalent: Aggregate annual emissions of greenhouse gases and from sectors and source categories listed in Annex A to the Protocol for each year of the commitment period that has been subject to an annual review; Any adjustments under Article 5.2 applied for each year, recorded as the difference between the adjusted estimate and the submitted inventory estimate; Cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Protocol in the commitment period calculated as the sum of the amounts defined in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above for all years of the commitment period that have been subject to an annual review; [Additionally, when a Party has issued or cancelled assigned amount pursuant to Article 3.3 or 3.4, the secretariat shall record in the Party's account the following inventory information in units of CO2 equivalent: Greenhouse gas emissions or removals under Article 3.3 and 3.4; Any adjustments to Article 3.3 or 3.4 estimates, recorded as the difference between the adjusted estimate and the submitted estimate.] The secretariat shall record in each Party's account the following assigned amount information: [Initial] assigned amount established pursuant to Article 3.7 and 3.8; Any assigned amount carried over from the previous commitment period pursuant to Article 3.13; [Any assigned amount issued pursuant to Article 3.3 or 3.4;] [Any assigned amount cancelled pursuant to Article 3.3 or 3.4;] Any assigned amount acquired pursuant to Articles [4,] 6,12 or 17; Any assigned amount transferred pursuant to Articles [4,] 6 or 17; Total assigned amount, calculated as the sum total of the amounts defined in subparagraphs (a)-(f) above; Any assigned amount retired each year; Total assigned amount retired during the commitment period. Where a Party has submitted recalculated estimates of emissions or removals for a previous year or years of the same commitment period, the secretariat shall, subject to review under Article 8 [with the authorization of [the COP/MOP or the compliance committee]], amend a Party's annual aggregate greenhouse gas emissions from the previous year(s) and, where relevant, remove an adjustment that was previously applied. At the end of the true-up period, the secretariat shall conduct the final compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts. Upon expiration of the true-up period, the secretariat shall, at the request of a Party, remove any assigned amount in excess of the Party's aggregate emissions from sources listed in Annex A during the commitment period from the Party's current account, and record the assigned amount in the Party's account for the subsequent commitment period pursuant to Article 3.13. D. Reporting For each Annex I Party, a report on the annual compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts shall be produced and forwarded to [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] and the Party concerned. A single report on the final compilation and accounting of assigned amounts shall be published after the end of the true-up period and forwarded to [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee].] PART IV: REVIEW OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS The purpose of the review of national systems is: To provide a thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of the capacity of a national system and the adequacy of its institutional, legal and procedural arrangements to produce an inventory of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks in conformity with Article 5.2; To assess the extent to which the guidelines for national systems under Article 5.1 have been adhered to, especially any mandatory elements, and to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their commitments under Article 5.1; To provide [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] with reliable information on the adequacy of information on national systems established under Article 5.1; To enable [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] to assess compliance with Article 3 and to provide the COP/MOP with adequate information to perform its functions. The review of national systems shall take place in two parts: A thorough review of the national system conducted in-country; A desk review of any reported changes in the national system reported since the first thorough review, conducted in conjunction with the annual inventory review. A thorough review of national systems should be conducted as an in-country visit as part of the pre-commitment period review. The review of national systems shall be conducted through appropriate means such as interviews with personnel involved in inventory planning, preparation and management, and through examination of relevant records and documentation, including use of the inventory CRF and preparation of the national inventory report. Based on any findings during the individual inventory review and on findings related to reported changes in national systems considered by the expert review team to be potentially significant in relation to an identified problem in the Party's inventory, the expert review team may request an additional country visit to review the relevant components of the national system in conjunction with an in-country inventory review. In-country review The expert review team shall conduct a thorough and comprehensive review of each Annex I Party's national system. The review of national systems should cover: Activities undertaken by the Party to implement, and performance of, mandatory general functions described in paragraph 10 of the guidelines for national systems, and mandatory specific functions related to inventory planning, preparation and management in accordance with paragraphs 12, 14 and 16 of those guidelines; Activities undertaken by the Party to implement, and performance of, functions related to inventory planning, preparation and management as specified in non-mandatory language in paragraphs 13, 15 and 17 in the guidelines for national systems; Reported and archived information on national systems in accordance with guidelines under Articles 5.1 and 7, including plans and internal documentation related to the functions mentioned in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above. The expert review team shall assess, on the basis of the information submitted under Article 7, and additional information gathered during the in-country visit, whether the Party has performed the general and specific functions related to inventory planning, preparation and management referred to in paragraph above, and, if so, whether those functions were performed adequately. The assessment of the inventory preparation functions shall be further based on the most recent annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the common reporting format, and its consistency with IPCC good practice guidance. The assessment as to whether the archived inventory information is adequate shall be further made on the basis of an assessment of the completeness of archived information for a sample of source categories chosen by the expert review team, which includes some key source categories, defined in accordance with IPCC good practice guidance. Review of changes in national system Any changes in the functions of the national systems reported by Annex I Parties or identified by the expert review team during the in-country visit that may affect the preparation of greenhouse gas inventories in conformity with Article 5.2 and the guidelines for national systems should be reviewed annually in conjunction with the annual inventory review. The scope of such a review shall follow the scope set out for the in-country review according to paragraphs to above. Based on the assessment carried out according to paragraphs to above, expert review teams shall identify any potential problems in, and factors influencing, the fulfilment of commitments related to the functions of national systems according to paragraphs 10 to 17 of the guidelines for national systems. This provision shall apply for both in-country reviews and reviews of changes in national systems. The process of the in-country review shall follow the timetable for the review of the Party's national communication defined in part VII of these guidelines. The process of review of changes in the national system shall follow the timetable for the review of national inventories defined in part II of these guidelines. The preparation of the reports should also follow these respective timetables. The final national system review report shall follow the outline set out in paragraph and shall include the following specific elements: An evaluation of the overall organization of the national system, including discussion of the effectiveness and reliability of the institutional, procedural and legal arrangements for estimating GHG emissions; A technical assessment of the performance of each of the national system functions defined in paragraphs 10 to 17 of the guidelines for national systems, including an assessment of the system's strengths and weaknesses; Any recommendations by the review team for further improvement of the Party's national system. The results of the review of changes in national systems shall be included in the individual inventory review report and, where relevant, should cover the same elements as specified for the national system review report in paragraph (a) to (c) above. PART V: REVIEW OF NATIONAL REGISTRIES The expert review team should assess: The extent to which the guidelines for national registries have been adhered to, especially any mandatory elements; Whether accounts have been established in the national registries for all legal entities. (to be elaborated) [PART VI: REVIEW OF INFORMATION UNDER ARTICLE 6 (to be elaborated)] The purpose of the guidelines on the review of national communications of Annex I Parties, including information reported under Article 7.2, is: To provide a thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of national communications and information reported under Article 7.2 of the Kyoto Protocol; To examine in an objective and transparent manner whether quantitative and qualitative information was submitted by Annex I Parties in accordance with reporting guidelines under Article 7.2 of the Kyoto Protocol; To promote consistency in the review of the information contained in the national communications, including information reported under Article 7.2, for Annex I Parties; To assist Parties included in Annex I to improve reporting of information under Article 7.2 and the implementation of their commitments under the Protocol; To provide information for [the COP/MOP and the compliance committee] on the implementation of commitments by Annex I Parties. Supplementary information under Article 7.2 shall be incorporated into the national communications and shall be reviewed as part of the review of the communications. (Once a choice has been made between the options contained in paragraph , the agreed text on when the national communications will be reviewed will be inserted here.) Prior to the in-country visit, the expert review team will conduct a desk review of the Party's national communication. The review team shall notify the Party concerned of any questions the team has regarding the national communication and of any focal areas for the in-country visit. The review of the national communication covers the national communication, including supplementary information reported under Article 7.2.
