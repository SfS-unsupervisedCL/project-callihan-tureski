Letter dated 7 November 2000 from the Permanent Representative of Namibia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to respond to allegations contained in the letter from the Permanent Representative of Rwanda to the United Nations dated 25 October 2000 addressed to the President of the Security Council (S/2000/1045), in which the Government of Rwanda asserts that "a combined force of the Congolese Armed Forces (FAC), the former Rwandese Armed Forces (ex-FAR), Interahamwe, the forces for the Defence of Democracy in Burundi (FDD) and Mai-Mai supported by Zimbabwe and Namibia forces have intensified their military offensive along the Tanganyika sector in Katanga province". The allegations made by the Government of Rwanda are unjustified and devoid of any truth. The Namibian Defence Force (NDF) did not participate in any of the operations enumerated in the said letter. In fact, NDF is deployed hundreds of kilometres away from the areas mentioned, where no fighting is taking place. I wish to reiterate that the Government of the Republic of Namibia remains committed to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement (S/1999/815, annex) and its early implementation. I should be grateful if you would circulate the present letter as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Martin Andjaba Ambassador and Permanent Representative
