Sixty-second session Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009* Part II Political affairs Section 6 Peaceful uses of outer space (Programme 5 of the biennial programme plan and priorities for the period 2008-2009)** Contents Page Overview Programme of work Annex Outputs produced in 2006-2007 not to be carried out in the biennium 2008-2009 * A summary of the approved programme budget will subsequently be issued as Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-second Session, Supplement No. 6 (A/62/6/Add.1). ** Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-first Session, Supplement No. 6 (A/61/6/Rev.1). 6.1 The overall purpose of the programme is the promotion of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space for economic, social and scientific development, in particular for the benefit of developing countries. The programme evolved as a result of the recognition, by the General Assembly in its resolution 1348 (XIII), of the importance of using outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and of the need to promote international cooperation in the conduct of space activities. The legislative authority and direction of the programme is drawn from relevant Assembly resolutions and the decisions of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, which was established in 1959 by Assembly resolution 1472 (XIV), its Legal Subcommittee and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and their subsidiary bodies. Recommendations of particular relevance for the work to be undertaken under this programme are contained in the resolution entitled "The Space Millennium: Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development", adopted by the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III) and endorsed by the Assembly in its resolution 54/68. 6.2 By its resolution 59/2, the General Assembly reviewed the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations of UNISPACE III and endorsed the Committee's Plan of Action, contained in the Committee's related report (A/59/174). The report also considered the achievements of the Committee and its Subcommittees following the introduction of their revised agenda structures in 2000 and paved the way for further strengthening their role in promoting the peaceful uses of outer space. The Plan of Action constitutes a long-term strategy for enhancing mechanisms at the national, regional and global levels for developing and strengthening the use of space science and technology and their applications to support overarching global agendas for sustainable development; developing coordinated, global space capabilities; supporting specific agendas to meet human development needs at the global level; and supporting overarching capacity development. In implementing that strategy, the Committee will provide a bridge between users and potential providers of space-based development and services by identifying the needs of Member States and coordinating international cooperation to facilitate access to the scientific and technical systems that might meet them. To maximize the effectiveness of its resources, the Committee adopted a flexible and unique mechanism that takes advantage of partnerships established between its secretariat, Member States, intergovernmental organizations and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE III. 6.3 The programme will strengthen the international legal regime governing outer space, resulting in improved conditions for expanding international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space. The implementation of the programme will also strengthen efforts at the national, regional and global levels, including among entities of the United Nations system and international space-related entities, to maximize the benefits of the use of space science and technology and their applications. 6.4 The expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement for the Office for Outer Space Affairs in the biennium 2008-2009 are set out in detail, together with the required resources, under the programme of work. 6.5 The issue of publications as a part of the programme of work has been reviewed. It is anticipated that recurrent and non-recurrent publications will be issued as shown in table 6.1 and as described below under outputs. Summary of publications Publications actual estimate Recurrent Non-recurrent Total 6.6 The overall level of resources for the biennium 2008-2009 for this section amounts to $6,235,700 before recosting, reflecting an increase of $60,000 (1.0 per cent). The increase relates to the proposed establishment of one new post for a Programme Management Officer at the P-3 level in the Space Applications Section, and the amount is partially offset by decreases in non-post items, in particular under other staff costs, consultants and experts, travel of staff, contractual services and furniture and equipment. 6.7 During the biennium 2008-2009, the projected extrabudgetary resources, amounting to $681,000, will supplement resources from the regular budget to finance various activities, such as technical advisory services, training, workshops, seminars, field projects and publishing information on case studies and best practices in the use of space technology in various applications. 6.8 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269, resources identified for monitoring and evaluation for this section are estimated at $199,500.

The increase reflects additional resource requirements for the establishment of the new post for a Programme Management Officer to assist in preparing and producing outputs related to the use of space technology in disaster management and in coordinating the activities of the new programme with relevant activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications. This increase is partially offset by a decrease in requirements for non-post items under other staff costs, consultants and experts, contractual services (external printing), travel of staff, and furniture and equipment. Table 6.6 Summary of follow-up action taken to implement relevant recommendations of the oversight bodies Brief description of the recommendation Action taken to implement the recommendation Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/60/7, chap. II) The Advisory Committee recalls that in paragraph II.39 of its first report on the proposed programme budget for 2004-2005 (A/56/7), it recommended that the number, frequency, venues and duration of the meetings of intergovernmental and expert bodies, as well as committees and subcommittees, related to this programme be reviewed from time to time. The Committee was informed that the issue had been raised but that there had been no follow-up. The Committee recommends that this issue be pursued more actively with a view towards better rationalization of resources for this purpose (para. II.29). The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its two Subcommittees meet only once a year, invariably in Vienna. That venue results in lower costs to the United Nations because the Committee secretariat is located in Vienna. The issue of reducing the duration of the sessions of the intergovernmental bodies has been discussed several times by the Committee without reaching consensus and remains controversial. Any decision is to be taken by Member States. The Advisory Committee notes that 19 publications are estimated for 2006-2007. The Committee recommends that a review be undertaken to determine whether the publication of the print version could in some cases be scaled back in favour of the electronic version. In addition, greater use should be made of in-house printing, given the existing capacity in Vienna (para. II.31). The Office has included publications in CD-ROM version in its proposed publications plan, with a consequent reduced number of hard copies, resulting in a cost reduction.

A/60/6, paragraph Output Quantity Reason for discontinuation 6.15 (a) (v) Ad hoc expert groups: assistance to the chairs of the action teams established by the Committee to implement recommendations of UNISPACE III The ad hoc expert group presented its final report to the Committee at its session in June 2006. 6.15 (b) (v) Special events: a forum of policymakers and experts on the use of space science and technology within the United Nations system towards achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals The Inter-Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities agreed to reduce its annual meeting by half a day, during which the Office for Outer Space Affairs organizes an open forum with the participation of the States members of the Committee and of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations having permanent observer status with the Committee. Entities of the United Nations system make presentations on their activities on a theme included in the Millennium Development Goals followed by a round-table discussion. Special events: a panel for public outreach on activities undertaken to implement the plan of action of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space A more efficient way of achieving the objective has been substituted for this recurrent output. For 2006-2007, the Office has been cooperating with the Conference of Non-governmental Organizations in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations (CONGO) in the organization of public outreach seminars and panels. While the Office contributes to the development of the programmes of these activities and provides speakers for them, CONGO carries out the bulk of the work. Being an association of NGOs, CONGO can reach a more diverse cross-section of the public. 6.15 (c) (1) c Provision of technical and financial assistance to a limited number of selected participants in the long-term fellowship programme administered by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications The Office provides technical and financial assistance to the Regional Centres for Space Science and Technology Education, affiliated to the United Nations. The centres offer long-term fellowships (9-month education programme) which are enhanced by a 1-year follow-up project, in the home country of participants. The staff and financial resources of the Office would have a larger multiplying impact if utilized to support the centres. Total 4
