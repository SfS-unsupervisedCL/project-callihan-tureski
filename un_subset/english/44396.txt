Pursuant to article 8, paragraph 6, of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (General Assembly resolution 2106 A (XX), annex), States parties shall be responsible for the expenses of the members of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination while they are in performance of Committee duties. 2. In its resolution 47/111, the General Assembly welcomed the decision taken at the Fourteenth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention in January 1992 to amend article 8 of the Convention and requested the Secretary-General to take the appropriate measures to provide for the financing of the Committee from the regular budget of the United Nations, beginning with the budget for the biennium 19941995, and to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Committee met as scheduled until the amendment entered into force. 3. Acting in his capacity as depositary, the Secretary-General communicated the amendment to all States parties on 1 March 1993 (see annex I). It will be recalled that, at their Fourteenth Meeting, the States parties had decided that the amendment would enter into force when accepted by a two-thirds majority of States parties that had so notified the Secretary-General as depositary. As at 1 June 2008, notifications of acceptance had been received from 43 States parties to the Convention. 4. In section II of its resolution 61/148, the General Assembly strongly urged States parties to the Convention to accelerate their domestic ratification procedures with regard to the amendment to the Convention concerning the financing of the Committee and to notify the Secretary-General expeditiously in writing of their agreement to the amendment; requested the Secretary-General to continue to ensure adequate financial arrangements and to provide the necessary support, including an adequate level of Secretariat assistance, in order to ensure the functioning of the Committee and to enable it to cope with its increasing amount of work; and also requested him to invite those States parties that were in arrears to pay the amounts in arrears, and to report thereon to the Assembly at its sixty-third session. 5. Financing for the annual sessions of the Committee in 2007 and 2008 was provided from the regular budget, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 47/111. Consequently, no State party assessments were made in those two years. However, a number of States parties are still in arrears as a result of the nonpayment of previous assessments. As at 30 June 2008, the total arrears outstanding amounted to $141,809.82 (see annex II).
