Letter dated 15 May 2007 from the President of the Security Council to the Secretary-General I have the honour to inform you that your letter dated 7 May 2007 (S/2007/279) concerning your intention to establish a United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy in Ashgabat has been brought to the attention of the members of the Security Council. They take note of the information contained in your letter and the intention expressed therein, and invite you to inform them about the activities of the newly established Centre and its impact on the ground. They would welcome receiving such a report, for example, six months after the Centre becomes fully operational. (Signed) Zalmay Khalilzad President of the Security Council
