The meeting was called to order at 11.50 a.m. (a) Globalization and interdependence (continued) (A/C.2/67/L.12/Rev.1) Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.12/Rev.1: Promoting transparency, participation and accountability in fiscal policies 1. Mr. Favero (Brazil), introducing draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.12/Rev.1, said that the draft was based on the principles promoted by the Global Initiative for Fiscal Transparency, which were central to the voluntary and non-mandatory nature of the draft resolution and its respect for the legal and regulatory characteristics of each country, be it developed or developing. Throughout the negotiations, all parties had sought to raise awareness of the issue by promoting information and sharing domestic experiences related to fiscal transparency. It was hoped that, in future, the United Nations could act as a forum for sharing best practices and for voluntary cooperation from those countries and stakeholders that were willing to share enhanced public management practices. Transparency and social participation were key to the promotion of democratic governance; strengthening the channels of interaction between government and society was crucial to rendering government more efficient, accountable, effective, transparent and legitimate, particularly through management and budgetary planning. The initiative had been co-sponsored by a considerable number of delegations and he invited those who had not yet joined the list of co-sponsors to do so before the Committee took action on the draft resolution. 2. The Chair noted that Australia, Canada, Japan, Nigeria and Sri Lanka also wished to sponsor the draft resolution. (a) International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (continued) (A/C.2/67/L.16 and L.50) Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.50: International Strategy for Disaster Reduction 3. The Chair invited the Committee to take action on draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.50, which had been submitted on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.16. It contained no programme budget implications. 4. Mr. Laguna Celis (Mexico) said that the draft resolution was important because it called for a Third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, where it was hoped that a framework for disaster risk reduction would be adopted to succeed the Hyogo Framework for Action. In turn, it was hoped that this would help to mainstream the issue of disaster risk reduction in the United Nations development agenda. 5. Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.50 was adopted. 6. Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.16 was withdrawn. (g) Report of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme on its twelfth special session (continued) (A/C.2/67/L.21 and L.44) Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.44: Report of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme on its twelfth special session and implementation of section IV.C entitled "Environmental pillar in the context of sustainable development" of the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development 7. Mr. Laguna Celis (Mexico) said that he had asked that draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.44 be reissued to accurately reflect the language agreed upon by delegations in the informal consultations, as the draft currently contained a significant number of discrepancies. 8. The Chair informed the Committee that the Bureau had acceded to Mr. Laguna Celis' request. It was therefore proposed that action on the draft resolution should be postponed until the Committee's next plenary meeting. 9. It was so decided. (i) Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy (continued) (A/C.2/67/L.26 and L.52) Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.52: Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy 10. The Chair invited the Committee to take action on draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.52, which had been submitted on the basis of informal consultations on draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.26. It contained no programme budget implications. 11. Ms. Novák Horňáková (Czech Republic) said that the titles of the Secretary-General's reports should be added to footnote 7. The second line of paragraph 2 should also be amended to read "to be promoted through all sources of energy". The word "national" should be deleted from paragraph 4, and the word "promoting" deleted from paragraph 5. Paragraph 11 should refer to the "post-2015 development agenda", and the phrase "aimed at" in paragraph 14 should be replaced with "that could result in". 12. Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.52, as orally revised, was adopted. 13. Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.26 was withdrawn. (a) Follow-up to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (continued) (A/C.2/67/L.9, L.10, L.51 and L.53) Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.53: Follow-up to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries 14. The Chair noted that, as a result of the programme budget implications of the draft resolution, delegations needed more time to review those implications and to consult on the content of the statement prepared by the Secretariat in that regard. Therefore, it had been proposed that action on draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.53 should be postponed to the Committee's next plenary meeting. 15. It was so decided. Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.51: Smooth transition for countries graduating from the list of least developed countries 16. The Chair noted that, as a result of the programme budget implications of the draft resolution, delegations needed more time to review those implications and to consult on the content of the statement prepared by the Secretariat in that regard. Therefore, it had been proposed that action on draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.51 should be postponed to the Committee's next plenary meeting. 17. It was so decided. (b) Industrial development cooperation (continued) (A/C.2/67/L.32 and L.54) Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.54: Industrial development cooperation 18.

Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.54, as orally corrected, was adopted. 21. Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.32 was withdrawn.

Ms. del Castillo (Dominican Republic) said that draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.48* had been reissued in order to accurately reflect the language agreed upon by delegations in the informal consultations. However, paragraph 34 should also be corrected to read "the post-2015 United Nations development agenda". 24. Draft resolution A/C.2/67/L.48*, as orally corrected, was adopted. 25. Ms. Robl (United States of America) referred delegations to the statement made by the United States representative at the forty-eighth meeting of the Third Committee with regard to draft resolution A/C.3/67/L.42 on the right to food, as contained in document A/C.3/67/SR.48. 26.
