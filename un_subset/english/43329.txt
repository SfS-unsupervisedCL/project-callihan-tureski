This report has been prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the basis of input from the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of National Defence, the Superintendence of Banks and the General Directorate of Immigration. The Ministry of National Defence, for its part, has indicated that no military relations with Côte d'Ivoire have been established and in accordance with resolution 1572 (2004), none will be established for the supply, sale or transfer of arms or any related material or for the provision of assistance, advice or training related to military activities. In this connection, the Ministry of the Interior has confirmed that Guatemala does not engage in the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer of any type of arms or related material and does not provide military assistance, advice or training of any kind to Côte d'Ivoire. To this end, all competent departments have been notified of the measures prescribed by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1572 (2004) with a view to strengthening control over those aspects in accordance with paragraph 7, taking into account the exceptions set out in paragraph 8 (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the resolution.
