Letter dated 20 October 2000 from the Permanent Representative of Burundi to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to inform you that my Government has instructed me to bring to your attention a mistranslation in Presidential statement S/PRST/2000/29 of 29 September 2000 on the situation in Burundi. In the seventh paragraph of the statement, the English original reads: "It urges all concerned to ensure that former camp inhabitants are protected". The translation in the French text is as follows: "... faire en sorte que les personnes qui ont été internées dans les camps ...". This French translation is inaccurate and misleading. A number of Secretariat briefings as well as the briefing by the Facilitator, Nelson Mandela, have confirmed the total dismantling of the regroupment camps. The Security Council should commend this positive development in clear terms. I should therefore like the Security Council to correct this anomaly, and to go even further, congratulating the Government of Burundi or commending it for having kept its promise. It should be recalled that the rebellion is still posing as a condition for negotiating the ceasefire, among others, the dismantling of the regroupment camps. It must be denied this pretext by means of a clear and unequivocal wording, and invited rather to accept the unconditional halting of hostilities and rejoin the peace process supported by all the negotiators of the Peace Agreement signed on 28 August 2000. I should like this letter to be regarded as an official document of the Security Council and to be brought to the attention of all its members. (Signed) Marc Nteturuye Ambassador Permanent Representative
