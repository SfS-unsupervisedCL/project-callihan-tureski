Financing for development Legislative mandates 7.1 The overall objective of the programme is to promote and support international cooperation in the pursuit of sustained economic growth, the eradication of poverty and hunger, and sustainable development for all. While focused on tackling interlinked challenges in the social, economic and environmental fields, the programme also seeks to contribute to a mutually reinforcing relationship among the three pillars of United Nations work: peace and security, development and human rights. 7.2 The programme, which is under the responsibility of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, is ensuring complementarity and synergy among its nine subprogrammes. Its key programmatic thrusts are: (a) to provide substantive support to the bodies established under the Charter of the United Nations dealing with development issues, namely, the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and its related functional commissions, and expert bodies; (b) to monitor and analyse development trends, prospects and policy issues globally; and (c) to provide support for capacity development in policy formulation and implementation, in particular in relation to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, through, inter alia, implementation of the regular programme of technical cooperation and Development Account projects. 7.3 The programme has put development issues at the centre of global deliberations and helped Member States to forge a shared vision of development based on the internationally agreed development goals and commitments, with the Millennium Development Goals at the core, as identified in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012. Those commitments are collectively referred to as the United Nations development agenda. The programme is supporting the advancement of the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015, including linkages to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and its follow-up process. 7.4 In the biennium 2014-2015, the programme will continue to mobilize and provide practical support to help translate the development commitments into action. It will focus on the delivery of four main functions: (a) monitoring, research and analysis of development issues and emerging challenges, including through support to the global statistical system; (b) normative and policy support to United Nations intergovernmental processes; (c) assistance in capacity development and active promotion of capacity-building activities in order to support implementation of global conference outcomes at the country level; and (d) fostering collaboration and partnerships within the United Nations system and with civil society and the private sector. Increased attention will be given to the capacity development needs of the least developed countries, small island developing States and countries emerging from conflicts. 7.5 Fulfilling those functions requires strengthened analytical and monitoring capacity, in particular to identify and address emerging issues and cross-cutting policy challenges and to support both national development strategies and accountability and monitoring mechanisms at the intergovernmental level. Strategic integration is also essential to promoting a coherent and coordinated implementation process for the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and to support the design of the framework for the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015. This includes enhancing horizontal linkages across the subprogrammes of programme 7 to enable more effective and flexible support to Member States in pursuing the development agenda, in particular the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, in cooperation with entities of the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, to which the programme provides strategic support and ensures its stronger linkages with the United Nations Development Group, other executive committees and various other partners. 7.6 The programme will continue to emphasize the mainstreaming of gender perspectives into its subprogrammes. Consultations have taken place among concerned entities of the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs at the thematic cluster level. Those consultations are expected to continue enhancing coordination and collaborative work areas of the United Nations Secretariat in sustainable development.
