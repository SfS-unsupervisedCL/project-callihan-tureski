I. Introduction 1. The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 8 March 2002 (A/56/862) and amounted to $220,830,200 gross ($216,814,800 net). It provided for 220 military observers, 3,980 military contingent personnel, 259 international staff, 274 national staff and 82 United Nations Volunteers. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in paragraph 38 of its report dated 5 April 2002 (A/56/887/Add.9), recommended that the General Assembly appropriate $220,830,200 gross for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. 2. The General Assembly, by its resolution 56/250 B of 27 June 2002, appropriated an amount of $220,830,200 gross ($216,814,800 net) for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance 3. The mandate of the Mission was established by Security Council resolutions 1312 (2000) and 1320 (2000) and further adjusted by resolution 1430 (2002). The mandate for the performance period was provided by Security Council resolutions 1398 (2002), 1434 (2002) and 1466 (2003). 4. The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to maintain international peace and security. 5. Within this overall objective, during the performance report period, UNMEE has contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering the related key outputs shown in the frameworks below. These frameworks are grouped by components: substantive civilian, military and support. The components reflect, rather than determine, the common programmatic nature of the expected accomplishments and outputs contained in these components. 6. The frameworks represent a shift towards a results-based budgeting approach. The 2002/03 budget did not include standard frameworks for planned results, which would have been the baseline against which performance would be measured and reported. Therefore, the Mission mandate performance is presented in a transitional format showing the actual indicators of achievement and actual outputs during 2002/03 for which information was available. The expected accomplishment would lead to the fulfilment of the Security Council's objective within the time frame of the Mission and the actual indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishment during the performance period. The actual outputs represent the contributions by the Mission towards the expected accomplishments during the performance period. Expected accomplishment Actual indicator of achievement 1.1 Progress towards peaceful settlement of the border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea 1.1.1 High-level political officials of both parties participated in regular meetings and consultations with the Head of Mission Actual outputs Facilitated 32 meetings and consultations with high-level political officials and religious leaders of both parties between the Head of Mission and his team and produced related reports Head of Mission made 20 field visits to high-level community officials in the Temporary Security Zone and its adjacent areas Sent 40 letters to the host Governments on political matters; 12 notes verbales to the diplomatic community Held 132 political meetings and briefings with external stakeholders of the peace process Submitted four reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council Delivered a one-hour broadcast three times a week in six languages covering the mission area, 52 weekly press briefings, 20 press releases, 3 press statements and 6 public information campaigns, 12 monthly newsletters, 15,000 calendars, one 30-minute documentary, 2 fact sheets and 4 brochures Established 4 outreach centres located in Asmara, Barentu, Addis Ababa and Mekele, to sensitize the local populations of both parties about the United Nations in general and the status of the peace process in particular 1.2 Progress towards normalization of living conditions in the Temporary Security Zone and its adjacent areas 1.2.1 Regular meetings and activities between the United Nations and other organizations on human rights and humanitarian issues remained at the same level in 2002/03, as compared to 2001/02 Undertook 11 fact-finding and monitoring trips within the Temporary Security Zone with the United Nations country teams Held 40 weekly and 12 monthly meetings of the country teams, the annual joint meeting of the teams of Ethiopia and Eritrea and other ad hoc meetings, as necessary Comments Incursions into the Temporary Security Zone resulted in some displacement of the local population Actual indicators of achievement 1.3 Greater security among the local populations as a result of active monitoring of the human rights situation within the Temporary Security Zone and adjacent areas; progress towards meeting human rights commitments contained in the Algiers Peace Agreements 1.3.1 Reduction from 102 to 88 in the number of reported human rights violations, compared to 2001/02 1.3.2 50 per cent reduction in civilian repatriations from Ethiopia to Eritrea (from 1,303 in 2001/02 to 627 in 2002/03) and 75 per cent reduction in civilian repatriations from Eritrea to Ethiopia (from 3,812 in 2001/02 to 933 in 2002/03) Field visits and interviews with local populations in the Temporary Security Zone and its adjacent areas increased in 2002/03 by 30 per cent, compared to 2001/02 (from 310 in 2001/02 to 407 in 2002/03) Monitored 9 repatriations of Ethiopian civilians (933 persons) and 5 repatriations of Eritrean civilians (627 persons) Observed repatriation of last remaining 1,424 prisoners of war by both Ethiopia and Eritrea Interviewed 335 persons repatriated Investigated 51 cross-border incidents involving 102 alleged victims Investigated 37 reports of human rights violations (including harassment, discrimination, arbitrary arrest and detention, "disappearance", ill-treatment and sexual abuse) within the Temporary Security Zone and adjacent areas involving 136 alleged victims Conducted 74 monitoring visits to internally displaced persons, refugee and transit camps Chaired 8 meetings of joint UNMEE/United Nations country team Human Rights Forum to exchange information and coordinate human rights activities and programmes 1.4 Increased HIV/AIDS awareness 1.4.1 Increase in the number of people made aware of HIV/AIDS among host nations' defence forces and local populations Trained 230 trainers in 9 trainer-of-trainers courses in HIV/AIDS peer leadership, compared to 64 in 2001/02.

Applicable to home country Incremental transportation factor (In thousands of United States dollars) 1 Resource variance amounts are expressed in thousands of United States dollars. 7. The unutilized balance was mainly due to lower actual rotation costs than budgeted. The actual cost per rotation was $4,418, compared to the amount of $8,200 budgeted. 8. The unspent balance under this heading was mainly attributable to lower actual costs for the rotation of contingents, which averaged $541, compared to the budgeted cost of $710. 9. The unutilized balance under this heading was attributable primarily to the placement of staff at lower levels than the approved posts. 10. The unspent balance resulted from the recruitment of staff at lower levels than budgeted. 11. The additional requirements resulted from revisions to the memorandum of understanding to take into account the costs related to the deployment of a support unit to administer the United Nations Volunteers serving with the Mission. 12. Additional requirements related to travel by engineering and support units to various locations to implement new projects in the mission area, as well as to the redistribution of military observers to new team sites. 13. The additional requirements under this heading were primarily due to payments made to troop-contributing countries for accommodations and tentage under self-sustainment, pending the construction of United Nations-provided accommodation units. 14. The unutilized balance was primarily due to lower consumption of petrol, oil and lubricants. The lower-than-expected consumption was the result of a number of factors, namely, the use of local transport companies instead of UNMEE assets for the transport of goods and water, less frequent use of armoured personnel carriers and decreased movement of the troops, owing to delays in the boundary demarcation process. 15. The unutilized balance under this heading resulted primarily from lower usage of fuel than budgeted. Fuel consumption was lower than estimated, owing to the utilization of 2,616 fewer helicopter flying hours and 2,452 fewer fixed-wing flying hours. The lower requirements for flying hours resulted from less utilization of helicopters for casualty and medical evacuations than estimated, the discontinuance of the P-166 aircraft that had been budgeted for aerial photography and non-utilization of the IL-76 heavy cargo transport and C-160, which was on standby for medical evacuations. 16. The additional requirements resulted from the acquisition of equipment to implement new projects, namely an archiving system, help-desk application, Internet security, an electronic fax system, strengthening and upgrading of the network infrastructure by the provision of more stable and faster inter-office connections by replacing wireless with wired networking where needed and developing and implementing a back-up disaster recovery plan. 17. The unutilized balance resulted from the use of mission air assets for medical evacuations and repatriations, rather than air ambulance services. 18. The unutilized balance was due to lower actual requirements for reimbursement to troop-contributing countries for contingent-owned equipment provided under self-sustainment, as the amount reported in the signed memorandum of understanding was less than that reflected in the draft. Other supplies, services and equipment 19. The unutilized balance was primarily due to lower actual requirements for freight in relation to the shipment of ex-mission stocks and other items from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 20. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNMEE are: (a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $11,211,100 with respect to the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003; (b) To decide on the treatment of other income and adjustments for the period ended 30 June 2003 amounting to $13,294,000 from interest income ($4,592,000), other or miscellaneous income ($1,091,000), as well as prior period adjustments and savings on or cancellation of prior period obligations ($7,611,000).
