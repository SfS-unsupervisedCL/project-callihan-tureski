Report to the Security Council Committee established in accordance with paragraph 19 of Security Council resolution 1737 (2006) on steps undertaken by the Republic of Poland in order to implement the provisions of resolution 1803 (2008) of 3 March 2008 According to paragraph 13 of resolution 1803 (2008), the Republic of Poland wishes to inform the Committee of the measures that have been undertaken at the national level in order to implement United Nations Security Council resolution 1803 (2008), adopted on 3 March 2008. The relevant government agencies have been instructed to undertake all appropriate measures in order to implement the provisions of Security Council resolution 1803 (2008). 1. With the aim to meet requirements of paragraphs 3 and 5 of the above-mentioned resolution, appropriate authorities of the Republic of Poland were instructed to exercise vigilance and restraint regarding the entry into or transit through Polish territory of individuals who are engaged in, directly associated with or providing support for Iran's proliferation of sensitive nuclear activities or for the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems and to prevent the entry into or transit through Polish territory of individuals designated in Annex II to the resolution and additional persons designated by the Security Council or the Committee. 2. Poland amended the regulation of the Council of Ministers of 23 November 2004 imposing measures to prohibit and restrict the circulation of goods of strategic importance to national security. The regulation of 1 August 2007 imposes an unconditional ban on export to Iran of arms and dual-use items, covering all items listed in paragraph 8 (a) and (b) of the resolution. By this means paragraph 8 of the resolution was implemented. 3. In order to implement paragraph 9 of the resolution, Poland has instructed its appropriate authorities to exercise vigilance in entering into new commitments for public provided financial support for trade with Iran in order to avoid such financial support contributing to the proliferation of sensitive nuclear activities or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. 4. With the aim to meet requirements of paragraph 10, Poland has instructed its appropriate authorities to exercise vigilance and restraint over the activities of Polish financial institutions with all banks domiciled in Iran; in particular Bank Melli and Bank Saderat. 5. In order to implement paragraph 11, Polish custom authorities were instructed to inspect, where appropriate, relevant cargoes to and from Iran, of aircraft and vessels, at Polish airports and seaports, owned or operated by Iran Air Cargo and Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line, provided that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the aircraft or vessel is transporting goods prohibited under appropriate resolutions. Moreover, at the European Union (EU) level the following measures have been undertaken: 1. Commission Regulation (EC) No. 219/2008 of 11 March 2008 amended Council Regulation (EC) No. 423/2007 concerning restrictive measures against Iran. The new regulation provides an annex with a new list of persons, entities and bodies to whom the freezing of funds and economic resources should apply in accordance with resolution 1803 (2008). This regulation is applied directly in the Polish legal order. 2. The Council of the European Union is preparing a common position amending Common Position 2007/140/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Iran.
