(Signed) Kodjo Menan President of the Security Council Terms of reference for the Security Council mission to Haiti, from 13 to 16 February 2012 The terms of reference of the mission, led by Ambassador Susan Rice (United States of America), are as follows: Reaffirm the continued support of the Security Council for the Government and people of Haiti to rebuild their country, consolidate peace, democracy and stability and promote recovery and sustainable development, recognizing that Haiti has made considerable strides since the tragic earthquake of 12 January 2010 yet continues to face significant security, humanitarian and development challenges. Assess the implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular resolution 2012 (2011), and review the progress the Government of Haiti has made, with the assistance of the international community, particularly the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), in addressing the interconnected challenges in the areas of stability and security, including strengthening the rule of law and protecting civilians; economic and social development; institutional reform and governance, including elections; border management; and human rights. Express strong support for MINUSTAH and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and their efforts to improve stability and governance in Haiti, and create conditions conducive to Haiti's security, reconstruction and development. Assess the ongoing strengthening of the Haitian National Police and the national authorities' increasing exercise of the Haitian State's responsibility for the maintenance of stability and security in the country, examine efforts by MINUSTAH to increase coordination with the Haitian National Police and to strengthen the capacity of the Haitian National Police in order for it to take full responsibility for the security needs of Haiti, underscore the importance of the Haitian National Police being adequately funded, and encourage the Government of Haiti to take advantage of the support being provided by the international community to guarantee the provision of adequate security for the Haitian people. Assess the full range of Haiti's rule of law, security and security-related structures. Reiterate the importance of immediate, medium- and long-term sustained efforts to support the reconstruction of Haiti, consolidate democracy, peace and stability, ensure the protection of human rights and promote sustainable development, while bearing in mind the ownership and the primary responsibility of the Government and people of Haiti. Evaluate and discuss with the Government of Haiti progress in earthquake recovery, including the overall humanitarian situation, rubble removal, housing reconstruction and the rebuilding of critical infrastructure, and evaluate the impact of these efforts on security, stability and development; and assess the capacity of the Government of Haiti and the private sector to carry out civil engineering and reconstruction tasks, including consulting the Government of Haiti on how capacity can be increased so that Haitians can take on a wider role in reconstruction. Review and assess the efforts of the Government of Haiti, with the support of MINUSTAH and the cooperation of Member States, to address challenges to security, including threats to internally displaced persons and other vulnerable groups, sexual and gender-based violence, cross-border illicit trafficking of persons, drugs and arms, and other criminal activities. Urge all relevant political actors in Haiti, in particular the executive and the legislative branches, to engage in an effective dialogue towards a political agreement that would consolidate a concrete forward agenda for progress in key areas, such as Haiti's security, budget, recovery and development priorities, elections and electoral reform, including the participation of women in the electoral process and the completion of constitutional reform. Review the progress achieved so far and assess the state of planning and implementation of the upcoming legislative and local government elections. Underscore the importance of mutual commitments made by the international community and Haiti and convey the importance of the fulfilment of all pledges of support to the reconstruction of Haiti. Assess the impact of the health challenges facing Haiti on the country's security and stability and examine the efforts of the United Nations system, particularly MINUSTAH, to assist the Government of Haiti in addressing emerging health issues. Underscore the importance of full compliance of all MINUSTAH personnel with the United Nations zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and assess steps taken to implement this policy. Review progress of MINUSTAH implementation of the force reduction authorized in resolution 2012 (2011), assess planning to encourage greater Haitian ownership of security and reconstruction activities, and examine the potential for adjustments to the MINUSTAH force configuration based on the overall improved security situation on the ground, taking into account the impact of social and political realities on the stability and security of Haiti, the increasing development of Haitian State capabilities, including the ongoing strengthening of the Haitian National Police, and the national authorities increasing exercise of their responsibility for the maintenance of stability and security.
