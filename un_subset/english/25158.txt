The Counter-Terrorism Committee has considered the report carefully, with the assistance of its experts, and has written to the Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations to set out its preliminary comments. Fiji has been requested to provide a response in the form of a third report by 17 October 2003. I should be grateful if you could arrange for the present letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Inocencio F.
