Ms. Kelley (Secretary of the Committee), speaking on the programme budget implications of draft decision A/C.2/55/L.48, said, with respect to paragraph (c), that, following past practice, the meetings of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention in the next biennium would be taken into account when the draft calendar of conferences and meetings of the United Nations for the biennium 2002-2003 was prepared. The conference servicing requirements for the biennium 2002-2003 of the meetings of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies were estimated at $2,913,000 at full cost (at revised 2001 rates). Those costs would be met from a provision to be made under section 2, General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003, which would be not only for meetings programmed at the time of budget preparation, but also for meetings authorized subsequently, provided that the number and distribution of meetings were consistent with the pattern of meetings per year experienced in the past. Consequently, should the General Assembly decide to adopt draft decision A/C.2/55/L.48, the related expenses for servicing the Convention meetings would be addressed under section 2, General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003. 26.

The Chairman, speaking on behalf of Mr. Hanif (Pakistan), Vice-President, introduced draft resolution A/C.2/55/L.51, which was being submitted on the basis of information consultations held on draft resolution A/C.2/55/L.18. The draft resolution had no programme budget implications. 29. Mr. Ayari (Tunisia) pointed out that during the informal consultations, it had been agreed that the word "favourably" would be inserted after the word "Welcomes" in paragraph 14 of the English text. A similar insertion was to have been made in the Arabic text. 30. Draft resolution A/C.2/55/L.51 was adopted. 31. Draft resolution A/C.2/55/L.18 was withdrawn. The meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.
