The activities for which the Office of Central Support Services is responsible fall under subprogramme 4, Support services, of programme 24, Management and support services, of the biennial programme plan for the period 2006-2007. 28D.2 The Office of Central Support Services has undergone significant organizational restructuring during the biennium 2004-2005. Following the establishment of the Department of Safety and Security by section XI of General Assembly resolution 59/276 of 23 December 2004, the Security and Safety Service has been organizationally transferred, together with its resources, from the Office of Central Support Services to the new Department. Furthermore, individual services of the Office that had been reporting directly to the Assistant Secretary-General -- namely, those responsible for procurement, building management, commercial, travel and transportation, archives and other support services -- have been consolidated under the newly created Facilities and Commercial Services Division, with a view to improving the coordination and supervision of those activities. The structure of the Information Technology Service Division remains unchanged. 28.D.3 The main objectives of the Office include (a) ensuring continued efficient, effective and high-quality support for substantive programmes in the areas of information technology, procurement, travel and transportation, facilities management, archives and record management and management of commercial activities, (b) ensuring efficient Secretariat support services for the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council and their subsidiary organs when they are in session and for the special conferences and meetings held under the auspices of the United Nations and (c) facilitating, through the provision of information and documentation, the deliberations of the General Assembly and its relevant subsidiary organs on specific support service issues under their review. Within the context of the Secretary-General's management reforms, efforts to strengthen existing common and joint services among the United Nations organizations will continue. The progress being made in the area of common and joint services is reported in specific reports of the Secretary-General. The Office carries out its activities in cooperation with other departments and offices of the Secretariat. 28D.4 The expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement for the Office for the biennium 2006-2007, together with required resources, are presented by main organizational units of the Office. The overall framework of the expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement is shown in table 28D.1. Table 28D.1 Framework of expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement by component Component Number of expected accomplishments Number of indicators of achievement B. Programme of work Total 28D.5 The total regular budget resource requirements proposed under this section for the biennium 2006-2007 amount to $229,498,400, before recosting, reflecting a decrease in the amount of $379,400, or 0.2 per cent, as compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2004-2005. The proposals reflect the continuing emphasis on strengthening the central policy and guidance role of the Office of Central Support Services in information technology management, in line with the objectives of the Secretary-General with respect to the information and communication technology strategy, and on measures to increase the effectiveness of the Office's operations. In line with that objective, an additional provision for information and communication technology activities in the amount of $4.6 million, representing a 6.9 per cent increase over current levels, is proposed to address the requirements identified in the context of the strategy outlined in the report of the Secretary-General (A/59/265 and Add.1) and to ensure that the information technology infrastructure is maintained at levels that will permit effective programme delivery. The increase in resources under information and communication technology is offset by a decrease in other support services of $4.7 million, or 2.9 per cent, against the 2004-2005 level, reflecting the streamlining of those services and the introduction of more cost-effective processes and procedures. 28D.6 The overall net decrease of $379,400 can be summarized as follows: (a) The net decrease of $328,100 under executive direction and management relates to the abolition of one General Service (Other level) post ($128,100) and $200,000 for non-post requirements; (b) The net decrease of $51,300 under programme of work relates to a decrease of $1,195,800 in connection with the abolition of 10 General Service (Other level) and Trades and Crafts posts and a net increase of $1,144,500 for non-post requirements. 28D.7 Regular budget resources under this section are supplemented by extrabudgetary funding derived from programme support income received as reimbursement for the services provided by the central administration for extrabudgetary activities, funds and programmes, as well as from the support account for peacekeeping operations. Extrabudgetary resources are also derived from various sources of funding of Secretariat-wide requirements for the rental and maintenance of premises, telecommunications services and travel services. For the biennium 2006-2007, extrabudgetary resources are estimated at $89,985,200. The increase over current estimates reflects the effect of the expansion of support for peacekeeping operations. 28D.8 The estimated percentage distribution of the total resources of the Office for the biennium 2006-2007 is shown in table 28D.2. Table 28D.2 Percentage distribution of resources by component Regular budget Extrabudgetary 28D.9 The distribution of resources is summarized in tables 28D.3 and 28D.4.

Table 28D.6 Resource requirements Resources (thousands of United States dollars) Posts (before recosting) Post Non-post 28D.12 Resources amounting to $3,001,900 would provide for continuation of nine posts in the immediate Office of the Assistant Secretary-General and related non-post requirements. The decrease in post requirements ($128,100) reflects the abolition of one General Service (Other level) post, as a result of investment in technology. The non-post requirements, which would cover general temporary assistance, overtime, travel by the Assistant Secretary-General and hospitality costs, reflect a decrease of $200,000 in connection with general temporary assistance, based on past expenditure patterns. Table 28D.7 Resource requirements by subprogramme Subprogramme Regular budget resources requirements by subprogramme Resource requirements (before recosting): $71,611,000 28D.13 Under the guidance of the Information and Communication Technology Board, the Information Technology Services Division is responsible for the implementation of policies and standards promulgated by the Board; maintaining an up-to-date inventory of information and communication technology activities in the Secretariat; coordinating the implementation of strategic decisions taken by the Steering Committee on Reform and Management concerning information and communication technology; establishing, in cooperation with the Office of Human Resources Management, training plans for information and communication technology staff worldwide; and providing the necessary tools for supporting knowledge exchange and cooperative work. The Division is responsible for the provision of overall computing, telecommunications, office automation, software and hardware support and infrastructure support for conference rooms at Headquarters and, in cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations as appropriate, for lease lines and satellite communications to the overseas duty stations. It also provides infrastructure support for enterprise-wide applications such as IMIS, Galaxy, electronic mail and the Official Document System, as well as consulting and advisory services to all offices of the Secretariat, and undertakes research and development of new technologies. The Division also delivers services to permanent and observer missions of Member States to the United Nations in New York. 28D.14 The programme of activities and resources proposed for the Division reflect the priority attached by the Secretary-General to information and communication technology in his report on the information and communication technology strategy (A/59/265 and Add.1). The estimated resources of $71,611,000, including an increase of $4,651,800 over the revised appropriation for the biennium 2004-2005, reflect the strategy to ensure that investments in information and communication technology are focused on the sharing and dissemination of the United Nations institutional knowledge, the simplification of administrative and management processes and the improvement of services provided to the United Nations Charter organs and their subsidiary machinery.

Table 28D.9 Resource requirements 28D.17 Resources amounting to $71,611,000 would provide for the continuation of 133 posts in the Information Technology Services Division and related non-post requirements. The decrease in post requirements ($256,200) reflects the abolition of two General Service (Other level) posts, reflecting a return on investment in the automation of processes within the Division. The non-post requirements, including increases of $4,908,000, would cover the work programme detailed in paragraph 28D.16 above. The increase comprises the requirements for (a) contractual services ($2,948,700), reflecting the increase in demand for operational services related to Internet, servers, databases, storage and e-mail at Headquarters, and the development of enterprise-wide applications, including a new provision of $677,100 to cover the share of the costs of the Office of Central Support Services in centrally provided data-processing services; (b) general operating expenses ($5,007,300) to accommodate the additional costs of maintenance of the network and servers, including those for the local area network and the expansion of telecommunications infrastructure at Headquarters, including the requirements to cover the share of the costs of the Office of Central Support Services as a whole for the maintenance of centrally provided data-processing infrastructure; and (c) an increase of $165,800 in the requirement for travel in support of the communications needs for missions undertaken by the Secretary-General. These increases are partly offset by a decrease of $3,213,800, comprising: (a) $528,100 under other staff costs, consultants and supplies and materials based on past expenditure patterns, (b) $2,685,700 under data-processing equipment, relating to (i) lower requirements for telecommunication equipment ($1,955,000) under this section of the budget, in view of decentralized financing arrangements based on individual departments' usage of telecommunications and their reimbursements, and (ii) lower requirements for the replacement of office automation equipment in the Office of Central Support Services, in connection with the established replacement cycle ($730,700). Resource requirements (before recosting): $154,885,500 28D.18 The Facilities and Commercial Services Division is responsible for this component of the central support services. This includes the management and operation of all existing physical facilities and the physical plant at Headquarters and the coordination of the management of overseas properties; the transportation, accommodation and routing of all travel undertaken at United Nations expense and the moving of the household goods and personal effects of staff from and to locations worldwide; the procurement of goods and services for the Organization's activities at Headquarters through the provision of related services; and the preservation and servicing of records with continuing value in support of the Organization's operational, informational, legal and other needs. In addition, the Division is responsible for the management of commercial-related activities at Headquarters and the coordination of special events and the mail and pouch operations.

Table 28D.11 Resource requirements 28D.21 Resources amounting to $154,885,500 would provide for the continuation of 316 posts in the Facilities and Commercial Services Division and related non-post requirements. The decrease in post requirements ($939,600) is the net result of (a) the abolition of six General Service (Other level) and one Trades and Crafts posts, stemming from investments in technology resulting in streamlining the administrative processes ($908,400), and (b) the reclassification of two Trades and Crafts posts to the General Service (Other level) category to adequately reflect their functions in the Division ($31,200). The non-post requirements of $106,498,800, reflecting a decrease of $3,763,500, consist of (a) a one-time provision of $1,501,700, approved in the biennium 2004-2005 by General Assembly resolution 59/276 (XI), in the context of measures for strengthening the safety and security of the Headquarters compound, (b) a one-time provision for elevator repairs ($472,300) and for the acquisition of office furniture ($32,500) and (c) a net decrease in the amount of $1,757,000 for various operational requirements under the work programme, stemming from the introduction of more efficient and cost-effective work processes and procedures based on the investments in technology. Table 28D.12 Summary of follow-up action taken to implement the relevant recommendations of the oversight bodies Brief description of the recommendation Action taken to implement the recommendation Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/58/7, chap. II) The Committee recommended that a replacement cycle for personal computers of four years, which is being applied in peacekeeping missions, also be applied at Headquarters and at offices away from Headquarters. Exceptions to this rule should be explained (para. VIII.51). The current proposals reflect a four-year replacement policy in the Secretariat. The Committee noted that the indicators of achievement and performance measures listed in table 29D.12 of A/58/6 (sect. 29D) did not include information on targets to be reached. The Committee reiterated its view that in the next report on procurement reform, improvements should be reflected in this area (para. VIII.52). The performance measures presented in these proposals have been modified to be indicative of both achievement and user satisfaction. Report of the Board of Auditors (A/59/5, chap. II) The Board recommended that the Administration seek further coordination among the various information and communication technology boards and steering committees in order to strengthen the governance of information and communication technology on an Organization-wide basis (para. 77). The Administration takes note of the Board's recommendation. However, information and communication technology coordination has been increasing steadily as efforts are made to enhance the level of coordination of all information and communication technology activities, particularly in such areas as enterprise networking, global security, access control, business continuity and disaster recovery and common methodology for justifying information and communication technology initiatives. Over the past year, cooperation among the various information and communication technology groups at Headquarters and offices away from Headquarters has significantly deepened. Since the first meeting of information and communication technology chiefs at offices away from Headquarters, held at the headquarters of the Economic Commission for Africa early in 2004, a number of videoconferences and mass meetings at critical junctures have been convened, including network and conference service information and communication technology meetings in New York and the information and communication technology and security meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. The Administration is confident that it is heading in the right direction to achieve the level of coordination desired. The Board recommended that the Administration ensure that comprehensive, consistent and ideally uniform policies be finalized, promulgated and distributed throughout the Organization (para. 79). The Administration has begun to take appropriate measures to ensure, to the extent possible, that unified, system-wide policies are promulgated. The Secretary-General's bulletin on the use of information and communication technology resources and data has been approved by the Information and Communication Technology Board and will be promulgated and distributed to all heads of department and office. The Board recommended that the Administration finalize, and share with funds and programmes, the planned common format for information and communication technology strategy documents, covering the main issues, key mission objectives, the contribution of each project to these objectives, with a quantitative evaluation of costs and benefits, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis, a risk analysis and a discussion of the factors that would determine success or failure (para. 86). The information and communication technology strategy of the United Nations Secretariat explicitly addresses the alignment of information and communication technology projects with the core mission. The Secretariat has also adopted a standard methodology, the high-level business case, for justifying and approving information and communication technology initiatives. The methodology addresses the evaluation of costs and benefits, including risk-adjusted measurements of costs and benefits, the analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and return on investment. Each department and office of the Secretariat is also responsible for ensuring the substantive alignment of its information and communication technology initiatives in accordance with the new procedures for approving information and communication technology initiatives. The Board recommended that the United Nations adopt and implement a uniform methodology for determining the total cost of information and communication technology with a view to improving the decision-making process on such issues as outsourcing and cost recovery (para. 89). The total budgeted cost of information and communication technology is routinely reported in budget proposals. For the biennium 2002-2003, this information was presented in detail in A/56/6 (Introduction), paragraphs 63 to 70 and table 8. For the biennium 2004-2005, this information was presented in detail in A/58/6 (Introduction), paragraphs 24 to 32, and in supplementary information made available during intergovernmental review. Such information is once again provided in the introduction to the present proposed programme budget. The Board encouraged the Administration to develop a consistent method for the evaluation, before and after implementation, of its information and communication technology expenditure (para. 93). The high-level business case is a formal method of evaluating information and communication technology initiatives and is relied on by the Project Review Committee in that regard. The methodology addresses the beginning of the life cycle of an information and communication technology initiative. As reported by the Board in paragraph 92 of its report, the additional components needed to track information and communication technology initiatives throughout their entire life cycle, including benefits realization, are being planned for implementation. The Board recommended that the United Nations review the delegations of authority, methodology and monitoring for the management of computerized data and information (para. 95) The Information Technology Services Division of the Office of Central Support Services is currently addressing the management issues related to authority, segregation of responsibility and monitoring of computerized data and information with the adoption of the methodology and application of the Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT). The Board recommended that the Administration establish, as planned, a formal portfolio of information and communication technology industry practices in order to provide a complete view of information and communication technology initiatives, projects and facilities across all United Nations organizational units (para. 97). A complete view of information technology assets can be obtained from the electronic revised version of e-Assets, which was implemented in the third quarter of 2003 and is available to all United Nations organizational units on the United Nations Headquarters Intranet site (iSeek). The Board recommended that the Administration ascertain that training programmes on the development and implementation of an information and communication strategy are available and coordinated (para. 99). The Information Technology Services Division coordinates with the training service of the Office of Human Resources Management in planning for the training of staff in the development of information and communication technology strategies. The organization and management of information and communication technology security and awareness training (one of the building blocks of the information and communication technology strategy) is also one of the deliverables defined in the project on compliance with the industry standard. The Board recommended that the Administration continue to take appropriate steps to adopt common standards and best practices, including documenting "lessons learned" exercises (para. 102). The Administration remains committed to the institutionalization of best practices and standards, and it has recently introduced the COBIT methodology into its management framework and processes. To this end, it has also implemented the software package COBIT Adviser to facilitate and support this initiative, while aggressively pursuing ISO 17799 compliance and certification as a Secretariat-wide initiative and working on standards relating to total economic impact, project management and other practices. The Administration appreciates the applicability of the ISO 9001 standard and the Information Technology Infrastructure Library method and looks forward to exploring alignment with those methodologies and others in the future, once the outcome of current and highly demanding projects have been determined. The Board encouraged the Administration to finalize its implementation of an Organization-wide framework for the assessment of risk in all offices (para. 112). The Administration continues to make every effort to finalize the implementation of the Organization-wide framework for the assessment of risk in all offices. The Board recommended that the Administration (a) ensure that service-level agreements clearly define the roles and responsibilities of third party service providers and continually satisfy the business requirements, (b) undertake a formal risk assessment process prior to engaging third party service providers, (c) regularly assess the performance of service providers vis-à-vis the targets and commitments specified in the service-level agreements and (d) ensure compliance with the provisions of the Procurement Manual in re-engaging service providers (para. 116). The Information Technology Services Division is already responsible for the evaluation and assessment of risk related to the security of information and data for service-level agreements and services provided by third parties. A standard risk assessment methodology has been defined by the information and communication technology security unit in a draft information and communication technology security, business continuity and emergency preparedness policy. Information and communication technology security-related risk assessment initiatives have been conducted by the security unit both at the Secretariat and at offices away from Headquarters. The Board recommended that the Administration (a) promptly issue a comprehensive policy on information and communication technology security, business contingency and emergency preparedness and (b) update the corresponding user manual for back-up services (para. 120). The information and communication technology security, business continuity and emergency preparedness policy is pending formal accreditation from a third party for compliance with international security standard ISO 17799. The Board recommended that the Administration provide for appropriate expertise to review and monitor information and communication technology functions (para. 126). The Information Technology Services Division will coordinate with the training services of the Office of Human Resources Management in developing training plans that will ensure that the required expertise is available in the Organization. The Board recommended that the Administration (a) enhance its database on vendors in order to generate information on the invitees and awardees, and (b) report accordingly to the General Assembly (para. 229). The Procurement Service will continue to upgrade the recently developed database and reporting system, which generates specific information on invitees for specific bids, responses and awardees by vendor name and country of origin. The Board encouraged the Administration to resolve the issues concerning the computerized procurement system with a view to ensuring the integrity and verifiability of all procurement data (para. 233). The Administration continues to make every effort to improve the integrity and verifiability of all procurement data by developing a single unified system that will meet the needs of the various departments involved in procurement practices. The lack of a real-time interface with IMIS has been a limitation of the Reality system. In that regard, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of Central Support Services are working vigorously on ways to enhance the Mercury system in order to overcome that deficiency.
