Research, analysis and advocacy Subprogramme 2. Services for policymaking and treaty adherence Subprogramme 3. Technical assistance and advice Legislative mandates 13.1 In the United Nations Millennium Declaration the General Assembly established the achievement of sustainable development as an aim of the Organization. Sustainable development has many dimensions. It requires that the resources of the planet be shared so as to promote human dignity. It also requires good stewardship of those resources so that future generations may inherit a better world. Moreover, it is important to free individuals from the burden of "uncivil" behaviour in order to safeguard their survival, dignity and livelihood and assist in regenerating community values to prevent crime. This aspect is at the core of the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which is mandated to assist Member States in their struggle against illicit drugs, crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. In the Millennium Declaration, Member States also resolved to intensify efforts to fight transnational crime in all its dimensions, to redouble the efforts to implement the commitment to counter the world drug problem and to take concerted action against international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. 13.2 Actions against the world drug problem, global criminal activity and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations are a common and shared responsibility that must be addressed in a multilateral setting and require an integrated and balanced approach. 13.3 The report of the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, entitled "A more secure world: Our shared responsibility" (see A/59/565), highlights the need for a new security consensus in the twenty-first century which goes beyond that of State security, as was the case at the founding of the United Nations. The new security threats, individually as well as in their complex interrelationship, are all linked with development, the rule of law and human rights. Transnational crime and terrorism are among the six clusters of international threats identified in the aforementioned report. The Secretary-General, in his report entitled "In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all" (A/59/2005 and Add.1 and 2), and the General Assembly, in its 2005 World Summit Outcome, clearly recognize organized crime and terrorism among the major security concerns. 13.4 All of this has articulated clearly the strategic position of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime within the general nexus of development, security and human rights. 13.5 The policy directions of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime are grounded in: (a) the international drug control conventions, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the universal legal instruments against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations; (b) the Millennium Declaration; (c) key resolutions of legislative organs, in particular General Assembly resolution 46/152, establishing the crime prevention and criminal justice programme, and resolutions 45/179 and 46/185 C on the drug control programme; (d) the twentieth special session of the General Assembly on countering the world drug problem; (e) the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century, adopted by the Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (General Assembly resolution 55/59, annex), the related plans of action (General Assembly resolution 56/261, annex) and the Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses: Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, adopted by the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (General Assembly resolution 60/177, annex); (f) the recommendations resulting from the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 60/1); and (g) the Secretary-General's report, entitled "Uniting against terrorism: recommendations for a global counter-terrorism strategy" (A/60/825). 13.6 The three pillars of the work programme of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime are: (a) Research and analytical work to increase knowledge and understanding of drug, crime and terrorism issues and to expand the evidence base for making policy and operational decisions; (b) Normative work to assist States in the ratification and implementation of international treaties, the development of domestic legislation on drugs, crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and the provision of secretariat and substantive services to the relevant treaty-based and governing bodies; (c) Field-based technical cooperation projects, upon request, to enhance the capacity of Member States to counteract illicit drugs, crime and terrorism. 13.7 Globalization has created an environment where illicit drugs, crime and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations can flow easily across borders. The welfare gains to be derived from open trade and the flow of public goods are offset, however, by the globalization of threats to the survival, dignity and livelihood of individuals. The interventions of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime are therefore designed to contribute to the achievement of security and justice for all: making the world safer from crime, drugs and terrorism. 13.8 This vision is comprehensive and forward-looking and sets the frame of the medium-term strategy of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which is currently being developed. That strategy is based on extensive consultations with internal/external stakeholders and experts and aims at balancing comprehensiveness with selection. It is set against the need to clearly delineate the comparative advantage of the Office and set the stage for increased partnership strategies with major players in related fields. 13.9 In pursuing its objectives, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime will make every effort to integrate the gender perspective, particularly in its projects in the areas of prevention, the provision of alternative livelihoods and human trafficking.
