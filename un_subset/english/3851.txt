No one may address the Conference without having previously obtained the permission of the President. Subject to rules 21, 22 and 25 to 27, the President shall call upon speakers in the order in which they signify their desire to speak. The secretariat shall be in charge of drawing up a list of speakers. 2. Debate shall be confined to the question before the Conference and the President may call a speaker to order if his or her remarks are not relevant to the subject under discussion. 3. The Conference may limit the time allowed to each speaker and the number of times each delegation may speak on a question. Before such a decision is taken, two representatives may speak in favour of, and two against, a proposal to set such limits, after which the motion shall be immediately put to the vote. In any event, unless otherwise decided by the Conference, the President shall limit each intervention on procedural matters to three minutes. When the debate is limited and a speaker exceeds the allotted time, the President shall call him or her to order without delay. Rule 21.

Rule 22. Points of order During the discussion of any matter, a representative may at any time raise a point of order, which shall be decided immediately by the President in accordance with these rules. A representative may appeal against the ruling of the President.

Rule 25. Adjournment of debate A representative may at any time move the adjournment of the debate on the question under discussion.

Rule 26. Closure of debate A representative may at any time move the closure of the debate on the question under discussion, whether or not any other representative has signified his or her wish to speak. Permission to speak on the motion shall be accorded only to two speakers opposing the closure, after which the motion shall, subject to rule 28, be put immediately to the vote. Rule 27. Suspension or adjournment of the meeting Subject to rule 39, a representative may at any time move the suspension or the adjournment of the meeting. Such motions shall not be debated, but shall, subject to rule 28, be put immediately to the vote. Rule 28.

Rule 29. Basic proposal The draft convention on the establishment of an international criminal court transmitted by the Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court shall constitute the basic proposal for consideration by the Conference. Rule 30. Other proposals Other proposals shall normally be submitted in writing to the Executive Secretary, who shall circulate copies to all delegations. As a general rule, no proposal shall be considered at any meeting of the Conference unless copies of it have been circulated to all delegations not later than the day preceding the meeting. The president may, however, permit the consideration of amendments, even though these amendments have not been circulated or have only been circulated on the same day. Rule 31. Withdrawal of proposals and motions A proposal or a motion may be withdrawn by its proposer at any time before a decision on it has been taken, provided that it has not been amended. A proposal or a motion that has thus been withdrawn may be reintroduced by any representative. Rule 32. Decisions on competence Subject to rules 22 and 28, any motion calling for a decision on the competence of the Conference to discuss any matter or to adopt a proposal submitted to it shall be put to the vote before the matter is discussed or a decision is taken on the proposal in question. Rule 33. Reconsideration of proposals When a proposal has been adopted or rejected it may not be reconsidered unless the Conference, by a two-thirds majority of the representatives present and voting, so decides. Permission to speak on a motion to reconsider shall be accorded only to two speakers opposing the motion, after which it shall be put immediately to the vote. CHAPTER VII Decision-taking Rule 34. General agreement 1. The Conference shall make its best endeavours to ensure that the work of the Conference is accomplished by general agreement. 2. If, in the consideration of any matter of substance, all feasible efforts to reach general agreement have failed, the President of the Conference shall consult the General Committee and recommend the steps to be taken, which may include the matter being put to the vote. Rule 35. Voting rights Each State participating in the Conference shall have one vote. Rule 36. Majority required [1. Subject to rule 34, decisions of the Conference on all matters of substance shall be taken by a two-thirds majority of the representatives present and voting. 2. Decisions of the Conference on matters of procedure shall be taken by a majority of the representatives present and voting. 3. If the question arises whether a matter is one of procedure or of substance, the President shall rule on the question. An appeal against this ruling shall be put to the vote immediately and the President's ruling shall stand unless overruled by a majority of the representatives present and voting. 4. If a vote is equally divided, the proposal or motion shall be regarded as rejected.] Rule 37. Meaning of the expression "representatives present and voting" For the purpose of these rules, the phrase "representatives present and voting" means representatives present and casting an affirmative or negative vote. Representatives who abstain from voting shall be considered as not voting. Rule 38. Method of voting 1. Except as provided in rule 45, the Conference shall normally vote by show of hands or by standing, but any representative may request a roll-call. The roll-call shall be taken in the English alphabetical order of the names of the States participating in the Conference, beginning with the delegation whose name is drawn by lot by the President. The name of each State shall be called in all roll-calls and its representative shall reply "yes", "no" or "abstention". 2. When the Conference votes by mechanical means, a non-recorded vote shall replace a vote by show of hands or by standing and a recorded vote shall replace a roll-call. Any representative may request a recorded vote, which shall, unless a representative requests otherwise, be taken without calling out the names of the States participating in the Conference. Rule 39. Conduct during voting The President shall announce the commencement of voting, after which no representative shall be permitted to intervene until the result of the vote has been announced, except on a point of order in connection with the process of voting. Rule 40. Explanation of vote Representatives may make brief statements, consisting solely of explanations of their votes, before the voting has commenced or after the voting has been completed. The President may limit the time to be allowed for such explanations. The representative of a State sponsoring a proposal or motion shall not speak in explanation of vote thereon, except if it has been amended. Rule 41. Division of proposals A representative may move that parts of a proposal be decided on separately. If a representative objects, a decision shall be taken on the motion for division. Permission to speak on the motion shall be accorded only to two representatives in favour of and to two opposing the division. If the motion is carried, those parts of the proposal that are subsequently approved shall be put to the Conference for decision as a whole. If all operative parts of the proposal have been rejected, the proposal shall be considered to have been rejected as a whole. Rule 42. Amendments 1. A proposal is considered an amendment to another proposal if it merely adds to, deletes from or revises part of that proposal. 2. Unless specified otherwise, the word "proposal" in these rules shall be considered as including amendments. Rule 43. Decisions on amendments When an amendment is moved to a proposal, the amendment shall be decided on first. When two or more amendments are moved to a proposal, the Conference shall first decide on the amendment furthest removed in substance from the original proposal and then on the amendment next furthest removed therefrom and so on until all the amendments have been decided on. Where, however, the adoption of one amendment necessarily implies the rejection of another amendment, the latter amendment shall not be put to a decision. If one or more amendments are adopted, a decision shall then be taken on the amended proposal. Rule 44. Decisions on proposals 1. If two or more proposals relate to the same question, the Conference shall, unless it decides otherwise, decide on the proposals in the order in which they were submitted. The Conference may, after each decision on a proposal, decide whether to take a decision on the next proposal. 2. Revised proposals shall be decided on in the order in which the original proposals were submitted, unless the revision substantially departs from the original proposal. In that case, the original proposal shall be considered as withdrawn and the revised proposal shall be treated as a new proposal. 3. A motion requiring that no decision be taken on a proposal shall be put to a decision before a decision is taken on the proposal in question. Rule 45. Elections All elections shall be held by secret ballot unless otherwise decided by the Conference. Rule 46. Elections 1. If, when one person or one delegation is to be elected, no candidate obtains in the first ballot a majority of the representatives present and voting, a second ballot restricted to the two candidates obtaining the largest number of votes shall be taken. If in the second ballot the votes are equally divided, the President shall decide between the candidates by drawing lots. 2. In the case of a tie in the first ballot among three or more candidates obtaining the largest number of votes, a second ballot shall be held. If a tie results among more than two candidates, the number shall be reduced to two by lot and the balloting, restricted to them, shall continue in accordance with the preceding paragraph. Rule 47. Elections 1. When two or more elective places are to be filled at one time under the same conditions, those candidates, in a number not exceeding the number of such places, obtaining in the first ballot a majority of the votes of the representatives present and voting and the largest number of votes shall be elected. 2. If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of places to be filled, additional ballots shall be held to fill the remaining places, the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in the previous ballot, to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled, provided that, after the third inconclusive ballot, votes may be cast for any eligible person or delegation. If three such unrestricted ballots are inconclusive, the next three ballots shall be restricted to candidates who obtained the greatest number of votes in the third unrestricted ballot, to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled, and the following three ballots thereafter shall be unrestricted, and so on until all the places have been filled. CHAPTER VIII Subsidiary bodies Rule 48. Committee of the Whole The Conference shall establish a Committee of the Whole. Its bureau shall consist of a Chairman, three Vice-Chairmen and a Rapporteur. Rule 49. Drafting Committee 1. The Conference shall establish a Drafting Committee consisting of [21] members, including its Chairman who shall be elected by the Conference in accordance with rule 6. The other [20] members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Conference on the proposal of the General Committee, taking into account equitable geographical distribution as well as the need to ensure the representation of the languages of the Conference and to enable the Drafting Committee to fulfil its functions. The Rapporteur of the Committee of the Whole participates ex officio without a vote, in the work of the Drafting Committee. 2. The Drafting Committee shall, without reopening substantive discussion on any matter, coordinate and refine the drafting of all texts referred to it, without altering their substance, formulate drafts and give advice on drafting as requested by the Conference or by the Committee of the Whole and report to the Conference or to the Committee of the Whole as appropriate. Rule 50. Other subsidiary bodies The Committee of the Whole may set up working groups. Rule 51. Officers Except as otherwise provided in rule 6, each subsidiary body shall elect its own officers.
