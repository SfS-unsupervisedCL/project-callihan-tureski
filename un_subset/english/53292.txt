The budget for the maintenance of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010, set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 2 April 2009 (A/63/803 and Corr.1), amounted to $47,082,000 gross ($43,089,600 net). It provided for 8 military observers, 8 police personnel, 173 international staff, 290 national staff inclusive of 11 national Officers, and 28 United Nations Volunteers. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in paragraph 41 of its report (A/63/746/Add.14), recommended that the General Assembly appropriate $47,044,200 gross for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. 2. The General Assembly, by its resolution 63/295, appropriated an amount of $46,809,000 gross ($42,816,600 net) for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance A. Overall 3. The mandate of the Mission was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1244 (1999). 4. The Mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life for all inhabitants of Kosovo and advance regional stability and prosperity of western Balkans. 5. Within this overall objective, the Mission has, during the performance report period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below. These frameworks are grouped by the substantive and support components as reflected in the related budget. 6. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based-budgeting frameworks set out in the 2009/10 budget. In particular, the performance report compares the actual indicators of achievement, that is, the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement, and the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs. B. Budget implementation 7. The total expenditure for the maintenance of the Mission for 2009/10 amounted to $46,660,400 gross ($41,613,700 net) compared to the resources approved for the maintenance of the Mission for the period in the total amount of $46,809,000 gross ($42,816,600 net), appropriated under the terms of General Assembly resolution 63/295. 8. The Mission began the 2009/10 reporting period with a new configuration, following a period during which the profile and size of the Mission had been downsized and adjusted as a consequence of Kosovo's declaration of independence in February 2008 and the deployment in December 2008 of the European Union Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) in Kosovo. 9. During the reporting period, the Mission continued to focus on the peaceful integration of all communities in Kosovo with the aim of advancing regional stability and prosperity. Its main priorities were to support the reconciliation and integration of Kosovo's communities, to advance the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, to facilitate dialogue and cooperation between Pristina and Belgrade in areas of practical concern, and to facilitate Kosovo's participation in international initiatives. 10. EULEX, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) continued to operate within the framework of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). These entities regularly exchanged information with UNMIK and coordinated effectively at the operational and strategic levels. 11. During the performance period, progress was noted with respect to the Mission's facilitation of the Kosovo institutions' involvement in international initiatives, agreements and meetings, which had largely stopped during the second half of 2008. While the Kosovo institutions' official position did not change, and they insisted that it was their prerogative to represent Kosovo independently, they nonetheless re-engaged in international and regional forums and participated in multilateral meetings on issues such as energy, trade, transport, cultural heritage and justice home affairs, with UNMIK facilitation. 12. However, the Mission's efforts to facilitate dialogue, cooperation, and the resolution of issues of common concern were affected by the deliberations of the International Court of Justice on the question as to whether the unilateral declaration of independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government of Kosovo was in accordance with international law, as requested in General Assembly resolution 63/3. The advisory opinion was only delivered after the performance period ended on 30 June 2010. For most of the reporting period, the Mission thus operated against a political background in which decision-making by the authorities in Pristina and Belgrade was influenced by concerns over how the International Court of Justice might interpret their actions. 13. The success of the Mission in fulfilling the planned indicators of achievement set out in the 2009/10 result-based-budgeting frameworks was in some instances also affected by the changed circumstances on the ground. In several cases, UNMIK was no longer in a position to directly influence or evaluate the progress of the indicators of achievement, such as the opening of customs checkpoints or the signing of protocols in the rule of law area. The Mission took this into account while preparing the budget for 2011/12 and has revised its results-based-budgeting frameworks accordingly. 14. The Mission's vacancy rates for all categories of personnel improved as compared to the 2008/09 financial period, with the only exception being three international temporary positions. However, the 2008/09 period was characterized by reconfiguration and downsizing, which led to high vacancy rates. Nonetheless, the Mission worked actively to fill all vacant positions in 2009/10 to ensure that the necessary staffing establishment was in place to support the implementation of the Mission's mandate. 15. During the reporting period, the Mission realized most significant variances as compared with the approved budget in three expenditure classes, namely, national staff, facilities and infrastructure and communications. Additional requirement for national staff in the amount of $3.1 million was attributable to a salary increment of 14.2 per cent during the period, actual vacancy rate of 4.8 per cent as compared to the planned 10.0 per cent, and because salaries were budgeted at a lower grade than encumbered. This was offset by lower requirements under facilities and infrastructures, where funds in the amount of $2.3 million were not utilized primarily owing to cancellation of maintenance contracts and postponement of alteration and renovation services. In addition, lower requirements related to communications in the amount of $673,200 were attributable to the replacement of the external contractors' services by the in-house services and lower-than-estimated requirements for other communication services. C. Mission support initiatives 16. The main mission support initiative in 2009/10 was the development of the mission support plan with a view to achieving efficiency gains. The plan was based on a new support concept where UNMIK would utilize the available commercial market within the mission area by outsourcing selected support services. The plan envisages implementation in four phases from January 2010 to July 2011. 17. Phase 1 took place from January to April 2010 and comprised of planning and preparation activities, including solving outstanding claims and establishing commercial contracts for rental of premises. In addition, expressions of interest were issued to confirm the feasibility of cost-effective outsourcing of access control in Belgrade as well as facilities and vehicle maintenance in Kosovo. During phase 1, disposal of excess assets and facilities was completed, the functions of 29 mission support posts were identified to be abolished and 30 entry control security posts were identified to be outsourced. The completion of this phase also allowed the Mission to reduce the number of international communications and information technology consultants by training national staff to take over these roles in radio and satellite technical support and information technology help desk services. 18. Phase 2 involved procurement actions from April 2010 to June 2010. During this phase, contracts for the outsourced services were developed and employment opportunities were identified for the staff to be replaced. Market surveys were conducted and expressions of interest were issued, which indicated that outsourcing of further logistic support functions could be cost effective. 19. Phases 3 and 4 will take place during the 2010/11 financial period. Phase 3 will include implementation and evaluation activities from July 2010 to January 2011. During this phase, service contracts will be signed and the services provided evaluated. Phase 4 will involve reconfiguration from January to July 2011. During this phase, UNMIK offices currently performing tasks to be outsourced will be reconfigured and surplus logistic facilities will be closed. The implementation of these activities and anticipated savings will be reflected in the 2011/12 budget proposal. D. Partnerships, country team coordination and integrated missions 20. During the budget period, UNMIK and the United Nations Kosovo Team, comprising United Nations agencies, funds and programmes active in Kosovo, drafted a joint United Nations strategic framework for Kosovo as part of the integrated mission planning process. The strategic framework identifies common priorities to be addressed in order to enhance cooperation and maximize the impact of the United Nations efforts in Kosovo, with the overall objective of supporting the realization of a stable and inclusive society in Kosovo that is firmly integrated into Europe. Within the framework of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), EULEX continued carrying out its responsibilities in the area of rule of law, and OSCE in the areas of institution-building, democracy-building and the promotion of human rights and rule of law. E. Results-based-budgeting frameworks Component 1: substantive 21. During the performance period, the Mission's substantive component focused on the peaceful reconciliation and integration of all communities in Kosovo as well as engagement with the leadership in Belgrade and Pristina on issues of mutual concern, and encouraged regional cooperation with the strategic aim to promote security, stability and respect for human rights. The progress made during the performance period towards the expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement was restrained by the underlying disagreement over the status of Kosovo and the anticipation of the advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice. The Mission's main task was acting as facilitator where necessary, including in northern Kosovo and in external representation. Other priorities included supporting and facilitating minority communities, as well as monitoring and reporting on internally displaced persons, missing persons, returns and human rights. UNMIK successfully carried out most of the planned outputs as detailed in the framework below. Progress was noted in the areas of minority community integration and inter-ethnic communication, in the light of the facilitation role of UNMIK, as well as in regional cooperation as a result of external representation functions by UNMIK. Expected accomplishment 1.1: Reconciliation and integration of all communities in Kosovo Planned indicators of achievement Actual indicators of achievement Decrease in the number of cases of serious inter-ethnic violence in Kosovo (2007/08: 145; 2008/09: 136; 2009/10: 126) UNMIK collected, cross-checked and reported information on 173 serious incidents affecting minority communities UNMIK collected information on this issue without always being able to clearly confirm the inter-ethnic character of the violence. It proved to be more difficult than expected to differentiate between ethnically and non-ethnically motivated crimes affecting minority communities for this indicator Increase in the number of municipalities with sustainable returns (2007/08: 30; 2008/09: 30; 2009/10: 33) There were 26 municipalities with sustainable returns. The lack of sustainable returns in the remaining municipalities was attributable partly to lower numbers of internally displaced persons from these municipalities and little indicated interest to return on the part of the displaced persons Full compliance with the stipulated targets of fair-share financing in respect of expenditures on minority communities from the Kosovo consolidated budget (2007/08: 12.5 per cent; 2008/09: 12.5 per cent; 2009/10: 12.5 per cent) Since the promulgation of the Kosovo Law on Local Self-Government, the fair-share financing scheme was no longer legally binding for the municipalities. Kosovo institutions had practically abolished the fair-share financing scheme as of 1 January 2009 and no successor mechanisms for the financial support of minorities were in place at the municipal level. While some municipalities have continued with some kind of fair-share financing, mainly owing to the participation of minority parties in the local governments, other municipalities have not allocated any funds to minority projects. UNMIK, together with OSCE, continued to advocate for the re-establishment of a voluntary system to properly reflect non-majority spending Increase in the total number of resolved cases of missing persons in Kosovo (2007/08: 114; 2008/09: 167; 2009/10: 287) The budgeted target of 120 (287-167) resolved cases was not achieved as the pace of resolving the cases of missing persons took longer than expected. However, during the reporting period some progress was made and 73 missing persons were identified and returned to their families (2007/08: 114; 2008/09: 167; 2009/10: 240) Planned outputs Completed (number or yes/no) Remarks 52 reports to the international community, including Member States, OSCE and the European Commission, covering 33 municipalities, on the inclusion of minority communities, returnees, women representatives in decision-making and issues related to the planning of returns 50 weekly reports and 251 daily reports to the international community, including Member States, OSCE and the European Commission UNMIK, in coordination with OSCE and other stakeholders, continued to monitor and to advise the Ministry of Communities and Return and local governments on the development and implementation of return policies to create conditions for sustainable return, and to monitor developments with respect to the effective reintegration of returnees, and advised relevant authorities on the implementation of the existing policy framework for the reintegration of repatriated persons Quarterly reports, in coordination with OSCE, to the international community, including Member States and the European Commission, on access of Kosovo communities to public services UNMIK made contributions to the three reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council issued during the reporting period (30 September 2009, 5 January 2010, 6 April 2010). A fourth report (S/2010/401) was prepared during the reporting period, but was issued on 29 July 2010, after the performance period, owing to the scheduling of the Security Council session on 3 August 2010 Quarterly reports of the Secretary-General to inform the Security Council about the political, security and community developments that affect inter-ethnic relations and stability in Kosovo and the subregion UNMIK reported on political, security and community developments that affect inter-ethnic relations and stability in Kosovo and the subregion in three reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council during the reporting period (30 September 2009, 5 January 2010, 6 April 2010). A fourth report (S/2010/401) was prepared during the reporting period, but was issued on 29 July 2010, after the performance period, due to the scheduling of the Security Council session on 3 August 2010 Weekly reports to the international community, including Member States, OSCE and the European Commission, on the rights of Kosovo communities to social, cultural and religious expression, including attendance at ceremonies and access to relevant sites, as well as on political developments UNMIK reported on political developments in 52 weekly reports and reported on developments in Kosovo communities, including rights to social, cultural and religious expression, in another 50 weekly reports. The reports were sent to the international community, including to Member States, OSCE, the European Commission and United Nations system agencies, funds and programmes Weekly reports to the international community, including Member States, OSCE and the European Commission, on monitoring measures undertaken by the Kosovo authorities to increase the participation and representation of minority communities in local administrative structures Weekly reports were sent to the international community, including to Member States, OSCE, the European Commission and United Nations system agencies, funds and programmes Quarterly reports to the international community, including Member States, OSCE and the European Commission, covering 33 municipalities, on the Kosovo authorities' support for the returns process, including the equitable distribution of financial assistance to all communities UNMIK made contributions to the three reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council issued during the reporting period (30 September 2009, 5 January 2010, 6 April 2010).

Over 700 meetings were held in the three northern municipalities and in UNMIK Administration Mitrovica during the reporting period. UNMIK met on a weekly basis with the municipal authorities, the Kosovo Police and KFOR at security meetings, and with representatives from the respective minority communities. Additional meetings were held on an ad hoc basis whenever required owing to the prevailing security or political situation. The information and knowledge acquired through such meetings enabled UNMIK to manage and pre-empt difficult situations Facilitation of communication between the authorities in Pristina and those in the three northern municipalities with regard to the provision of public services and the access of ethnic minorities to those services Weekly meetings were held with the central authorities in Pristina, particularly regarding projects, finance and civil status requirements.

The authorities in Pristina do not inform UNMIK about such documents High-level meetings to discuss political issues of mutual concern to Belgrade and Pristina (2007/08: 12; 2008/09: 10; 2009/10: 6) Achieved. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General held 6 meetings with high-level officials from the Government in Belgrade and 9 meetings with high-level officials from the authorities in Pristina during the reporting period (2007/08: 12; 2008/09: 16; 2009/10: 15) Opening of customs checkpoints in the northern municipalities of Kosovo (2007/08: 0; 2008/09: 0; 2009/10: 2) Achieved. Operations in the area of customs were taken over by EULEX. EULEX reinstated customs presence at the previously burnt down Gates 1 and 31 in northern Kosovo. It has been maintained, increased and improved, in close cooperation between EULEX customs and EULEX police. However, there has not been full customs control due to a perceived insufficient legal basis for EULEX executive customs authority in the north of Kosovo Increase in the total number of investigations by the Kosovo Police of crimes referred by INTERPOL (2007/08: 4,889; 2008/09: 7,194; 2009/10: 9,805) The UNMIK INTERPOL Liaison Office opened a total of 1,705 cases (international crime and auto theft) during the reporting period as compared to the target of 2,611 (9,808-7,194) as a result of fewer cases referred to the UNMIK INTERPOL Liaison Office by Member States through the INTERPOL database. While United Nations Police is in charge of the INTERPOL office in Kosovo, the Kosovo Police assumed more responsibility in the investigation of cases and in providing information to INTERPOL Increase in total number of INTERPOL Red Notices issued by the Kosovo Police (2007/08: 25; 2008/09: 42; 2009/10: 61) A total of 6 additional Red Notices were issued during the reporting period as compared to the target of 19 (61-42). The number of Red Notices was lower than expected, as some ambiguity remained during the reporting period regarding the procedures and relationships between the Kosovo Ministry of Justice, EULEX and UNMIK in issuing Red Notices Facilitation of up to 12 meetings with representatives from Belgrade and Pristina on the implementation of the provisions relating to police, courts, customs, transportation and infrastructure, boundaries and Serbian patrimony UNMIK facilitated 1 meeting with Serbian officials to discuss political and technical arrangements for setting up a mechanism suitable for Belgrade, Pristina and the Serbian Orthodox Church in the area of Serbian religious and cultural heritage.

The Head of EULEX police and the UNMIK Senior Police Adviser met once a month to discuss police and security issues. UNMIK also liaised with judicial authorities on police-related issues, including extradition requests and INTERPOL-related matters, on a bimonthly basis Daily liaison with INTERPOL, the National Central Bureaux of INTERPOL member States and EULEX with respect to exchanges of information on the security situation, as per relevant agreements concluded in 2002 The UNMIK INTERPOL Office liaised daily with INTERPOL, the National Central Bureaux of INTERPOL member States and EULEX on the security situation Coordination with EULEX on requests for assistance from the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 2 court orders were received for follow-up from the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia during the reporting period. UNMIK was in contact with authorities at the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to see if any orders were to be executed within UNMIK or EULEX.

Support was provided to the average strength of 448 civilian personnel and 16 military and police personnel. In addition, the support component processed claims from non-consensual use of property and completed the residual reconfiguration activities, including the handover of facilities to EULEX and the drawdown and disposal of the Mission's surplus assets. Expected accomplishment 2.1: Effective and efficient logistical, administrative and security support to the Mission Full implementation of network admission control system Achieved. Network admission control system has been fully implemented securing access to Mission's data network Reduction by 10 per cent in the repair time for the maintenance of vehicles (2007/08: 23.3 average hours; 2008/09: 20.39 average hours; 2009/10: 18.35 average hours) Achieved.

Preventive maintenance programme was implemented with 27 major breakdowns/service interruptions during the period Full compliance with the stock ratio of non-expendable assets established by property management The standard operating procedure for monitoring of stock ratios of non-expendable assets was developed by United Nations Headquarters in December 2009 and was implemented accordingly in UNMIK. Surplus stock was identified and the disposal methods included the sale of 4,979 assets to EULEX and the transfer of 415 assets to the United Nations Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy, and 143 assets to other United Nations missions. The residual surplus stock was not required by the United Nations Logistics Base and will be disposed of commercially. Full compliance with the stock ratio will be achieved in the 2010/11 financial period Service improvements Restriction of connectivity by unauthorized and non-United Nations-owned information technology equipment into the Mission's data network by up to 99 per cent Implementation of the Network admission control system resulted in over 99 per cent protection of the Mission's data network from unauthorized and non-United Nations-owned information technology equipment Implementation of a maintenance programme at every 5,000 kilometres of service with respect to the Mission's vehicle fleet Maintenance programme was implemented at every 5,000 kilometres of service Implementation of an early inspection programme and improved material control for all incoming maintenance materials Greater involvement of mission technical staff in quality inspection for all maintenance materials upon delivery of goods from suppliers resulted in improved incoming inspection The supply of maintenance materials was synchronized with demand, resulting in a lower level of inventory for all fast-moving items and improved material control Military, police and civilian personnel Emplacement, rotation and repatriation of an average of 8 military liaison officers and 8 United Nations police officers Average military liaison officers strength Average number of United Nations police officers strength All incumbent military and police personnel received respective administrative services Administration of an average of 491 civilian staff, comprising 173 international staff, 290 national staff and 28 United Nations Volunteers Civilian personnel administered, including: Average number of international staff Average number of national staff All incumbent civilian personnel received respective administrative services Implementation of a conduct and discipline programme for all military, police and civilian personnel, including training, prevention, monitoring and recommendations on remedial action where misconduct has occurred The following activities were carried out by the Conduct and Discipline Unit: All complaints concerning misconduct or questionable conduct were analysed and addressed; senior managers received strategic guidance on all conduct and discipline matters and coordination meetings were held; United Nations police and military liaison officers received briefings on sexual exploitation and abuse; e-mail message was sent to all UNMIK personnel as part of a prevention and outreach programme to ensure the enforcement of rules and regulations Facilities and infrastructure Maintenance and repair of 4 premises in Pristina and premises in each of Mitrovica, Belgrade and Skopje as well as 24 communications repeater sites Premises were maintained and repaired, including 3 in Pristina, 1 in Mitrovica, 1 in Belgrade and 1 in Skopje at the end of 2009/10 Owing to the delayed handover to EULEX, there were 5 premises in Pristina at the beginning of the 2009/10 period as compared to the planned 4 premises.

Financial resources Military contingents Formed police units Subtotal General temporary assistance Government-provided personnel Civilian electoral observers Consultants Official travel Air transportation Naval transportation Special equipment Other supplies, services and equipment Quick-impact projects (Thousands of United States dollars) Appropriation Group Original distribution Redeployment Revised distribution I. Military and police personnel II. Civilian personnel III. Operational costs Total Percentage of redeployment to total appropriation 23. The redeployment of funds to group I, Military and police personnel, was necessary to cover additional expenditure for United Nations police owing to the delayed submission of invoices by the supplier in relation to the shipment of personal effects. 24. The redeployment of funds to group II, Civilian personnel, was necessary to cover an increment of 14.2 per cent in the salary scale for national staff in accordance with United Nations policy and based on the Office of Human Resources Management salary survey, as well as a higher incumbency rate during the period. 25. The redeployment of funds from group III, Operational costs, was possible owing to the postponement and cancellation of several alteration and renovation projects at the Mission headquarters, as the Mission handed over several facilities to EULEX during the period and the planned combined maintenance contract was not realized, as well as decreased requirements for utilities and generator fuel owing to milder weather conditions. In addition, lower requirements for communications were achieved owing partly to international contractors being replaced by trained Mission personnel to provide support services. C. Monthly expenditure pattern 26. During the performance period, the expenditure pattern reflected higher-than-average expenditures primarily in August, September and December 2009. The increase in August was related to cleaning services and security services as a result of obligations raised to commit the funds for the activities during the 2009/10 financial period. In the month of September, the major reason for the higher expenditure was related to fuel for facilities and infrastructure as well as petrol for ground transportation owing to obligations raised to commit the funds for the activities of the Mission during the reporting period. In the month of December, the expenditure for international staff exceeded the normal level as repatriation grants, termination indemnity and other separation costs were paid out as a consequence of a delay in payments for some staff members separated from UNMIK in the 2008/09 financial period. D. Other income and adjustments Interest income Other/miscellaneous income Voluntary contributions in cash Prior-period adjustments Cancellation of prior-period obligations IV. Analysis of variances 27. The increased requirements were attributable to the payment of $100,986 for delayed submission by a systems contract supplier of invoices related to the 2006/07 financial period, which were only received in the 2009/10 financial period. The charges covered unaccompanied shipment of personal effects, and the original obligations raised for these charges lapsed after 12 months and were cancelled as per the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations at the end of the 2007/08 financial period. This was partly offset by no requirement for death and disability compensation during the reporting period. 28. The reduced requirements were attributable primarily to the higher vacancy rate for international staff of 15.6 per cent as compared to the budgeted 15.0 per cent. In addition, entitlements under common staff costs were lower than anticipated as a result of the implementation of the new conditions of service for international staff on 1 July 2009 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/250, as the impact of the changes was not fully known at the time of budgeting. This was partly offset by higher-than-anticipated requirements for staff assessment as well as nonbudgeted requirements for four Field Service Officers, who were still entitled to mission subsistence allowance in accordance with United Nations staff rule 13.7 (c). 29. The increased requirements were attributable to an increment of 14.2 per cent in the salary scale for national staff in accordance with the updated United Nations policy and based on a salary survey by the Office of Human Resources Management. In addition, the overall vacancy rate for national staff was 4.8 per cent as compared to the budgeted vacancy rate of 10.0 per cent, the euro appreciated against the United States dollar by an average of 4.9 per cent in the 2009/10 financial period as compared to the budgeted exchange rate, and the actual average grade level for local General Service staff (GL-4 step 8) and local National Officers (NO-A step 7) was higher than the budgeted grade level for General Service staff (GL-4 step 7) and National Officers (NO-A step 5). Additionally, payments of accrued annual leave balances to national General Service staff was effected as a result of a contractual reform. 30. The increased requirements were attributable primarily to the non-budgeted requirement for the P-3 Police Adviser position to coordinate the cooperation with EULEX. The General Assembly, in its resolution 63/295, decided to create three general temporary assistance positions to be absorbed within the approved budget. One position was encumbered from 17 February 2010. 31. The increased requirements were attributable primarily to non-budgeted consulting services for two months of a Legal Adviser, who dealt with third parties claims related to a demonstration in 2007. In addition, owing to an extended recruitment process and the urgent nature of some legal cases, including Kosovo Trust Agency and socially owned enterprises, two consultants were hired for two months and six months, respectively. Furthermore, the consultants on the Human Rights Advisory Panel were entitled to daily living expenses for which no budget provision was made. 32. The increased requirements were attributable to higher-than-anticipated travel costs for training in the Communications and Information Technology, Personnel, Finance and Security offices. Training of communications and information technology personnel was carried out to build in-house expertise that replaced higher-priced services provided by international contractors. The human resources reform initiatives led to increased travel for training courses related to Inspira, Nucleus and the Field Central Review Board. In the Finance Section, travel cost for a Chief Financial Officer workshop and field finance system training was underestimated. In the Security Section, the introduction of new security level system software, close-protection security training, a basic fire-fighting course and automotive workshop health and safety training resulted in higher-than-anticipated travel costs. In addition, non-budgeted travel costs for training under the substantive component related to gender training and training on facilitation of dialogue and mediation efforts led to higher-than-budgeted resource requirements. 33. The reduced requirements were attributable to the lower costs of maintenance services such as cleaning, repair and ground services as the handover of premises occurred earlier than anticipated. In addition, investments in renovation projects at Mission headquarters were cancelled or postponed until settlement of the property ownership rights for socially owned enterprises has been finalized. Furthermore, decreased requirements for utilities and generator fuel resulted from milder weather conditions, which reduced heating and cooling requirements, as well as the reduction of two premises in Pristina in February and April 2010. 34. The reduced requirements were attributable to lower requirements for petrol as the vehicle mileage was lower than budgeted owing to a reduction of staff and premises. In addition, the lower mileage and fewer accidents led to a reduced requirement for spare parts. 35. The reduced requirements were attributable to an overestimation of commercial communications in the budget as well as savings under communications support services as international contractors were gradually replaced by trained UNMIK personnel, who took over radio and satellite communications services, including programming of repeaters and VHF radios. 36. The reduced requirements were attributable to deferment of acquisition of equipment to the 2010/11 period to enable the redeployment of funds to the overspent account of national staff. In addition, savings were achieved for information technology services as international contractors were gradually replaced by trained UNMIK personnel, who took over and provided IT help desk services. Furthermore a prolonged procurement process delayed the implementation of new application licences, which resulted in lower requirements than budgeted. 37. The increased requirements were attributable to the non-budgeted requirement for laboratory supplies to operationally maintain the Mission's medical laboratory, required owing to the delayed EULEX takeover of medical services. In addition, influenza A (H1N1) preparedness required the non-budgeted purchase of vaccines following the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the Medical Support Services at United Nations Headquarters. 38. The reduced requirements were attributable to the finalization of the downsizing of the Mission, including a reduction in leasing costs for fewer photocopiers. Additionally, surplus equipment was shipped to other United Nations missions at the cost of the receiving mission as compared to the budget that provided for shipment of surplus assets to the United Nations Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy, with freight charges paid by UNMIK. 39. This was partly offset by increased requirements for external audit due to the cancellation of a valid obligation in a prior financial period. As a result, the valid charge was carried forward and led to the deficit which was covered in the reporting period. In addition, non-budgeted requirement for settlement of third-party claims related to the demonstration of 10 February 2007 in Pristina was not anticipated at the time of budgeting. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 40. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNMIK are: (a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $148,600 with respect to the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010; (b) To decide on the treatment of other income for the period ended 30 June 2010 amounting to $8,148,500 from interest income ($286,000), other/miscellaneous income ($5,754,800) and cancellation of prior-period obligations ($2,122,700), offset by prior-period adjustments ($15,000).
