In 1996, pursuant to its resolution 553 (XXVI), the Commission was entrusted, inter alia, with collaborating with member States in analysing the development process of formulating, evaluating and monitoring public policies to provide operational services on specialized information, advisory services, training and support in regional and international cooperation. 21.3 The Commission will continue to pursue key objectives shared by all the regional commissions, to foster economic integration at the subregional and regional levels, to promote the implementation of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and to support sustainable development by helping to bridge economic, social and environmental gaps between countries in the region and the industrialized economies. 21.4 To achieve those objectives, ECLAC will continue to respond to the needs of the countries in the region, serve as a regional forum and facilitator in building regional consensus and supporting the formulation of public policies to meet the challenges facing the region and conduct and promote multilateral dialogue, sharing knowledge and networking at the global, regional and subregional levels. The Commission will promote intraregional and interregional cooperation between the regional commissions and collaborate with other regional organizations and United Nations institutions. 21.5 A new subprogramme on financing for development is being proposed in response to the increasing demand from member States for analysis and operational services in this field, particularly in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial and economic crises, which underscored the critical importance and specificities of this issue for the development agenda of the region. A growing number of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are considered to be middle-income economies. As a result, the region's relative share of official development assistance is decreasing and most countries are facing difficulties in obtaining full access to and participating in the international financial markets. Therefore, a number of regional forums, including the Rio Group, have expressed the need for ECLAC to address this issue. Recently, the Committee of the Whole of ECLAC, at its twenty-fifth session, requested the secretariat to analyse this matter and recommend concrete actions. The results of that exercise are now reflected in the new subprogramme, which will be implemented within existing resources. 21.6 The Commission's overall strategy for achieving the objectives of the programme is structured around 13 interdependent and complementary subprogrammes, implemented through an integrated and multidisciplinary approach. The strategy will require an increase in the level of activities related to analytical, normative and advocacy work, as well as in the area of technical cooperation and support to member States in all the thematic areas covered by the programme. In formulating the present biennial programme plan, the strategic framework for the biennium 2012-2013 were drawn from the internationally agreed development goals stemming from the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic and social fields, including those set forth in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome. 21.7 During the period 2003-2008, the economic and social performances of Latin America and the Caribbean were encouraging. The region experienced steady economic growth, decreased poverty levels as well as improved significant aspects of its macroeconomic management, benefiting from fiscal surpluses and a lower debt level, and thus reduced its external vulnerability. The collapse of the financial sector in industrialized countries, in late 2008, rapidly spread throughout the entire world, generating the global economic crisis and seriously affecting Latin America and the Caribbean. As a result, the region experienced a negative growth in 2009, with Mexico and Central America suffering the worst costs. The impact was also felt in social indicators, as an additional 9 million people fell into poverty in 2009 while employment conditions worsened and the informal sector grew, affecting the most vulnerable groups such as the poor, women and the young. While various signs of recovery in the region fuelled the hope that economic growth would resume in 2010, the persistent vulnerability of the world economy means that a sense of caution for the future remains. 21.8 The crisis has shed light on the structural deficits hampering the development of Latin American and Caribbean countries and has raised questions about those countries' ability to address the issues and realities of the sustainable development agenda in the long term. The region's development patterns in the post-crisis international environment are expected to undergo significant adjustments to adapt to the "new normality" emerging in the aftermath of the crisis, which is characterized by slower growth globally, weaker global trade flows with additional barriers to trade, more restrictive and limited access to international financial markets and to financing for development, new labour market dynamics likely to be marked by a "jobless recovery", and the need to enhance the capacity of Governments to mitigate the effects of economic downturns. In terms of competitiveness, the gaps to be bridged in innovation and productivity still represent a key obstacle to the success of economic growth-with-equality strategies. Other structural problems -- such as poverty and its intergenerational transmission, income inequality, regressive tax systems, the effects of rapid demographic change, citizen security and safety -- place additional demands on social public expenditure, social reforms and the development agenda shared by civil society entities. Finally, global challenges such as climate change and the need to develop low-carbon economies urgently require the implementation of new strategies to foster adaptation, mitigation and risk reduction, as well as to enhance energy efficiency and jump-start the widespread use of renewable energies. In this post-crisis context, the role of institutions and market regulations needs to be revised and the role of the State must be redefined to generate the conditions for a sustainable and inclusive development that leads the region on a new path of sustainable development, with equality. Considering the complexity of the reform processes in the region and the rapidly evolving demands made by beneficiary countries, ECLAC will continue to provide, in a timely manner, relevant analysis and policy recommendations regarding development issues. Moreover, ECLAC will work in collaboration and coordination with the Governments in the region and counterpart institutions to ensure the link between national experiences and the national perspective, enable comparability of data and exchange of good practices, and provide effective technical cooperation services. 21.9 To meet these challenges, ECLAC will focus, in the context of the programme of work for the biennium 2012-2013, on the following priorities: (a) Improving macroeconomic stability and further enhancing policies that reduce vulnerability and mitigate the effects of economic and financial crises; (b) Strengthening the region's access to financing for development and enhancing the financial architecture at the global, regional and national levels; (c) Increasing the region's productive potential and reducing productivity gaps to achieve convergence with particular emphasis on innovation and new technologies; (d) Improving the region's position in the international economy through trade, regional integration and cooperation; (e) Promoting a social covenant by improving social equality, reducing social risks and reinforcing gender mainstreaming in public policies; (f) Enhancing sustainable development policies, energy efficiency and addressing the impacts of climate change; (g) Strengthening public management to enhance the role of the State in the twenty-first century; (h) Improving institution-building related to the management of global and transboundary issues and the provision of public goods at the regional level. 21.10 To that end, the Commission will emphasize analytical, normative, advocacy and capacity-building work to strengthen the design of sustainable development strategies and public policies and to facilitate the continuous monitoring of their practical implementation. Operational services in the areas of specialized information, technical cooperation and training will foster cooperation, networking and sharing of good practices at the subregional, regional and international levels, including South-South cooperation. ECLAC will continue to work on the integrated and comprehensive follow-up to the world summits from a regional perspective, in particular with regard to the region's progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. For that purpose, the Commission will continue to carry out regional coordination complementing the role of the resident coordinator in terms of operational work at the country level. Furthermore, ECLAC will reinforce its leading role as the convener of the meetings of the Regional Coordination Mechanism, which groups all the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the region, and its active participation in the United Nations Development Group. Close collaboration will also be enhanced with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and with inter-American, Ibero-American and Bretton Woods institutions such as the Organization of American States, the Ibero-American Secretariat and the Inter-American Development Bank. Cooperation will be pursued with relevant integration schemes and institutions at the regional and subregional levels. ECLAC will also strengthen its collaboration with private sector associations, non-governmental organizations, think tanks and the academic sector to promote policy dialogue and to involve such entities in the implementation of the sustainable development agenda. 21.11 The Commission will also continue to engage with the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, which is a key mechanism for ensuring global coherence on thematic areas common to entities of the United Nations Secretariat working in the social and economic sectors. 21.12 In its report on its fiftieth session, the Committee for Programme and Coordination recommended that the General Assembly request the Secretary-General to fully implement Assembly resolution 64/259, entitled "Towards an accountability system in the United Nations Secretariat", in order to achieve objectives and high-quality results in a timely and cost-effective manner while fully implementing and delivering on all mandates given to the Secretariat, as approved by the United Nations intergovernmental bodies and other subsidiary organs (A/65/16, para. 35). Pursuant to the Committee's recommendation, ECLAC has taken the following initiatives, within the existing resources funded by regular and extrabudgetary resources, to gain or improve efficiency: (a) Replaced the old traditional office telephone systems with a new telephone system that allows secure voice and video calls to be made over the Internet, reducing the cost of international calls; that reduction has been partially offset by higher costs related to multimedia and BlackBerry plans used by staff. The new telephone system has also reduced the time spent trying to call other ECLAC offices, increased collaboration between staff and improved communication between the telephony system and computer applications such as Lotus Notes, making it easier to exchange information. Implementation of the new system is still ongoing, as some ECLAC national offices still need to be connected; (b) Installed an automatic system that reduces the time needed by authors and editors to create, review and correct bibliographical references, thus improving standardization and facilitating access to resources; the system was implemented by a special ECLAC group on continuous improvement. 21.13 In its resolution 63/260, entitled "Development-related activities", the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of that resolution. The additional posts provided by the resolution have enabled the further strengthening of the Commission's support to Latin American and Caribbean countries in the analysis, evaluation and formulation of policies and measures in the following areas: trade and integration; partnership for development; information and communications technologies and innovation; gender parity and gender-related statistics; child mortality; eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; population issues with particular emphasis on indigenous people, people of African descent and ageing; and climate change and the management of natural resources. The additional posts have enabled the preparation of studies and the provision of technical cooperation services to inform and support decision-making in these areas. 21.14 The issue of publications as part of the programme of work has been reviewed in the context of each subprogramme. It is anticipated that recurrent and non-recurrent publications will be issued, as summarized below in table 21.3 and as shown in the information on outputs for each subprogramme. Table 21.3 Summary of publications Publications actual estimate Recurrent Non-recurrent Total 21.15 The overall resources required for the biennium 2012-2013 for this section amount to $107,227,000 before recosting, reflecting a decrease of $2,902,900 (or 2.6 per cent). The reduction in table 21.5 can be summarized as follows: (a) The net decrease of $6,400 under policymaking organs relates mainly to reduced requirements under non-post resources for various meetings in 2012-2013; (b) The net decrease of $326,200 under executive direction and management is due to the decrease in post resources ($198,200) resulting from the abolition of one Associate Economic Affairs Officer (P-2) post and a decrease under non-post resources ($128,000), due mainly to the redeployment of the requirements for communications of the Information Services Unit from executive direction and management to programme support, to be centrally managed by Administration with a view of increasing efficiency; (c) The net decrease of $1,030,000 under programme of work relates mainly to a decrease in post resources ($1,062,000) resulting from the abolition of six posts (5 P-2 and 1 Local level), partly offset by net increased requirements under non-post resources ($32,000) to carry out activities for the new subprogramme 4, Financing for development; (d) The net decrease of $1,540,300 under programme support relates mainly to a decrease in post resources ($869,000) resulting from the abolition of five posts (1 P-4, 1 P-2 and 3 Local level) and in non-post resources ($671,300), mainly in the requirements under: (i) communication costs, based on the downward expenditure trend due to the implementation of the new telephone system mentioned in paragraph 21.12 above; (ii) supplies and materials, based on expenditure patterns; and (iii) furniture and equipment, based on the assessment of the condition of existing information technology equipment and furniture and the decision of ECLAC to delay the replacement of such equipment and furniture. 21.16 The projected extrabudgetary resources of $30,000,000, reflecting an increase of $500,000 compared with the biennium 2010-2011, will be used for various studies and for technical cooperation, including through the provision of advisory services, assistance and support to the countries of the region, a field project on integration issues and training courses for policymakers to build up institutional capacity to address poverty, social inequity, and gender issues. ECLAC has been able to enter into agreements with its main bilateral and multilateral partners and is therefore able to make a stable projection of extrabudgetary resources. 21.17 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ensure that resources are clearly identified in all the sections of the proposed programme budget for the performance of monitoring and evaluation functions, $930,900 has been identified for monitoring, self-evaluation and evaluation activities. That amount, which represents a total of 50.3 work-months of Professional staff and 28.5 work-months at the Local level, comprises $718,400 from regular budget resources (reflected under each subprogramme) and $212,500 from extrabudgetary resources, including $187,400 in non-post resources (reflected under executive direction and management and programme of work). 21.18 The estimated share of the resources for ECLAC in the biennium 2012-2013 allocated to each component is shown in table 21.4 and the distribution of resource requirements, by component, is summarized in table 21.5.

The Commission is composed of 44 members and 8 associate members and holds biennial sessions during even-numbered years for five days, to review the work of the ECLAC secretariat and approve its biennial programme of work. The biennial session has two ad hoc committees, one on South-South cooperation and one on population and development. The thirty-fourth session of ECLAC will be held in Santiago in the first half of 2012. Committee of the Whole 21.20 The Committee of the Whole was established in 1952. It normally meets at United Nations Headquarters with permanent representatives of ECLAC member States, if and when required, during the years in which the Commission does not hold a biennial session. The plenary of the Committee of the Whole is expected to meet in New York for three days in 2013, to discuss issues of concern to the Commission. Presiding Officers of the Regional Conference on the Integration of Women into the Economic and Social Development of Latin America and the Caribbean 21.21 The Presiding Officers provide overall direction to the work of the secretariat on issues related to the integration of women into development in the region, in accordance with paragraph 88.2 of the Regional Plan of Action on the Integration of Women into the Economic and Social Development of Latin America and the Caribbean. The Presiding Officers will meet on three occasions in the coming biennium: twice in 2012, in Montevideo and Buenos Aires, and once in 2013, in Santiago. 21.22 The Regional Conference on Women in Latin America and the Caribbean (formerly known as the Regional Conference on the Integration of Women into the Economic and Social Development of Latin America) was established as a permanent subsidiary body of ECLAC at the eleventh extraordinary session of the Committee of the Whole, held on 21 November 1977. At that session, the Commission approved the above-mentioned Regional Plan of Action, which had been adopted in Havana in the same year. The purposes of the Regional Conference are to identify women's needs at the regional and subregional levels, present recommendations, undertake periodic assessments of the activities carried out in fulfilment of regional and international plans and agreements on the subject and serve as a forum for debates on relevant issues. Its sessions are held every three years and it is expected to meet in Brasilia in 2012. Committee of High-Level Governmental Experts 21.23 The Committee of High-Level Governmental Experts was established on 7 May 1971. It is a subsidiary organ of the Commission and acts as a forum devoted to the analysis of various aspects of the implementation and appraisal of development strategies in Latin America and the Caribbean. It meets, if and when required, annually. The Committee is scheduled to meet in New York in 2012 and 2013. Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee 21.24 The Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee was established in 1975. It coordinates economic and social development cooperation and addresses other development concerns of the Caribbean members of ECLAC.

The Committee will meet twice during the biennium 20122013: once in San Jose and once in Guatemala City. Regional Council for Planning and Presiding Officers of the Regional Council for Planning of the Latin American and Caribbean Institute for Economic and Social Planning 21.26 The Regional Council for Planning of the Latin American and Caribbean Institute for Economic and Social Planning was established in 1974. It is the principal intergovernmental body of the Institute, which has 40 member Governments and meets every four years. 21.27 The Presiding Officers of the Regional Council for Planning, comprising 11 member Governments, examine the work programme for the Institute and evaluate its past activities. The Presiding Officers meets at least once a year and are expected to meet in Mexico in 2012 and in Havana in 2013. Executive Committee of the Statistical Conference of the Americas of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 21.28 The Statistical Conference of the Americas and its Executive Committee were established at the same time (see below). The Executive Committee meets annually to provide support for the Conference. The main responsibilities of the Executive Committee are: to prepare a biennial programme for promoting regional and international cooperation on statistical matters and present the programme to the regular conference; to follow up on the implementation of agreements and carry out the tasks assigned by the Conference; and to decide on the substantive documentation to be presented to the Conference. 21.29 The Executive Committee will meet in Lima in 2012 and in Montevideo in 2013. Statistical Conference of the Americas of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 21.30 The Statistical Conference of the Americas was established as a subsidiary organ of the Commission pursuant to Commission resolution 580 (XXVIII) and Economic and Social Council resolution 2000/7. 21.31 The Conference meets on a biennial basis with the objectives of promoting the development and improvement of national statistics and their international comparability, strengthening cooperation among national statistical offices and international and regional agencies and preparing a biennial programme of regional and international cooperation to meet the demands of the countries of the region in the field of statistics. The Conference will meet in Santiago in 2013. Table 21.7 Resource requirements: policymaking organs Resources (thousands of United States dollars) (before recosting) Non-post 21.32 The amount of $1,288,800, reflecting a decrease of $6,400, would provide for the servicing of the meetings of ECLAC intergovernmental bodies. The decrease is due mainly to a reduction in operating requirements and supplies. Resource requirements (before recosting): $6,300,400 21.33 The Office of the Executive Secretary provides overall direction, supervision and management to the ECLAC secretariat, with a view to implementing the legislative mandates and the approved programme of work. It continues to be responsible for the preparation of a biennial institutional substantive report on the main topics to be discussed at the session of the Commission, as well as for the publication of the CEPAL Review. 21.34 In the coming biennium, the Office will provide direction and policy orientation and continue to establish the criteria for coordinating the implementation of and the follow-up to the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and other cross-cutting issues, such as gender mainstreaming and sustainable development, throughout the substantive subprogrammes. It is also responsible for coordinating the work programme with other United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies to ensure coherence. It also means coordinating with the Office of the Secretariat of the Commission, which is responsible for maintaining political relations with Governments and authorities of ECLAC member States, ensuring diplomatic and protocol functions and servicing intergovernmental meetings. 21.35 The Programme Planning and Operations Division, on behalf of the Executive Secretary, will continue to provide overall coordination, guidance and advice to the ECLAC subprogramme managers with respect to the formulation of the proposed strategic framework and priorities and its revisions, the preparation of the draft programme of work and the biennial report on the work of the Commission for consideration and adoption at the biennial session of the Commission, the preparation of the biennial proposed programme budget, the budget and programme performance reports. 21.36 The Programme Planning and Operations Division will continue to monitor the implementation of the work programme and will coordinate, organize and report on the implementation of the ECLAC evaluation plan. The Division will be responsible for coordination, guidance and supervision in respect of the ECLAC extrabudgetary technical cooperation programme and its relevant fund-raising activities. 21.37 The Information Services Unit is part of the Office of the Executive Secretary. The activities of the Unit are carried out in Santiago in close coordination with the Department of Public Information at United Nations Headquarters and include: (a) organizing press conferences and issuing press releases; (b) producing and disseminating booklets and information kits about the work of ECLAC and the United Nations; (c) managing the information architecture of the ECLAC website, including training focal points and tracking visitors on the network, downloading statistics for trends and identifying areas of interest; (d) placing opinion pieces in the region's media; (e) organizing campaigns through new forms of social media, and producing and editing a bimonthly newsletter; and (f) attending to journalists and the general public.

Table 21.9 Resource requirements: executive direction and management Post 21.40 The amount of $5,730,800 in post requirements would provide for 29 posts (1 USG, 1 D-2, 2 D-1, 1 P-5, 3 P-4, 1 P-3 and 20 Local level), as indicated in table 21.9. The decrease in post requirements is due to the abolition of one P-2 post. The non-post requirements of $569,600, reflecting a net decrease of $128,000, relate to, inter alia, requirements under general temporary assistance, consultants and experts, other staff costs, travel of staff, contractual services and general operating expenses. The net decrease is due mainly to a decrease in requirements for communications, resulting from the redeployment of these resources to be centrally administered under programme support, with a view to increasing efficiency. 21.41 During the biennium 2012-2013, expected extrabudgetary resources in the amount of $700,000 will provide for two posts, as reflected in table 21.9. The amount reflects an increase of $50,000 compared with the estimates for 2010-2011 due to a change in the post category for the temporary positions of one Legal counsel at the P-4 level and one Administrative Assistant in the Local level category.

Table 21.35 Resource requirements: subprogramme 12 21.114 The provision of $7,548,800 for post requirements would provide for 42 posts (1 D-1, 2 P-5, 7 P-4, 8 P-3, 4 P-2 and 20 Local level), as shown in table 21.35. The decrease of $194,000 is due to the abolition of one P-2 post. The amount of $479,600 for non-post requirements would provide for other staff costs, consultants, experts and travel of staff. The decrease of $13,100 relates to the reduced need for staff to travel following the identification of outputs for which analysis and consultations with State representatives could be done through videoconferencing. 21.115 During the biennium 2012-2013, expected extrabudgetary resources in the amount of $900,000 will provide for 1 post as reflected in table 21.35, and non-post resources for travel of staff, consultants, other project requirements and seminars relating to technical cooperation projects. The resources will enable the subprogramme to respond to the new needs and demands expressed by member States, such as those in ECLAC resolution 647 (XXXIII), on South-South cooperation, in which the secretariat was called upon to continue to analyse new alternatives for generating the volume of resources necessary for financing the development of the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean; ECLAC resolution 649 (XXXIII), on the Statistical Conference of the Americas of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, in which the need to develop technically independent, impartial and objective national statistical systems was noted; and ECLAC resolution 650 (XXXIII), in which the Executive Secretary was requested to conduct studies and formulate public policy proposals, in close cooperation with policymakers, with a view to building national economic and social development capacities. Subprogramme 13 Subregional activities in the Caribbean Resource requirements (before recosting): $6,482,900 21.116 Responsibility for the implementation of the subprogramme rests with the ECLAC subregional headquarters for the Caribbean, who are expected to work in close coordination with the rest of the ECLAC system. The strategy applied by the subprogramme will focus on continuing to provide technical secretariat services and support to the Caribbean Development and Cooperation Committee, a subsidiary body of ECLAC, in guiding the work of the subregional headquarters to assist the countries of the subregion in the follow-up and fulfilment of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Efforts under the subprogramme will also seek to facilitate the active engagement of countries of the subregion in the follow-up to global conferences and to establish comprehensive frameworks for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on progress made and gaps in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals. 21.117 The subprogramme will be implemented in accordance with the strategy detailed under subprogramme 13 of programme 17 of the strategic framework for the period 2012-2013.

Table 21.37 Resource requirements: subprogramme 13 21.120 The amount of $6,023,500 in post requirements would provide for the continuation of 35 posts (1 D-1, 1 P-5, 6 P-4, 5 P-3, 4 P-2 and 18 Local level), as shown in table 21.37. The decrease of $75,200 is due to the abolition of one Local level post. The amount of $459,400 for non-post requirements relates to other staff costs, consultants, experts and travel of staff. The decrease of $11,100 relates to lower travel costs due to the conduct of back-to-back missions, partly offset by an increase in requirements needed to convene an increased number of participants to ad hoc expert group meetings. 21.121 During the biennium 2012-2013, expected extrabudgetary resources in the amount of $1,100,000 will provide for 1 post, travel of staff, consultants, other project requirements and seminars relating to technical cooperation projects, specifically for implementing recommendations aimed at strengthening the role of ECLAC in the Caribbean, for providing the necessary technical assistance to member States to support the implementation in the Caribbean of the Mauritius Strategy, and for implementing the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Special account will be taken of the relevant provisions of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular Goal 1, on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, Goal 3, on promoting gender equality and empowering women, Goal 7, on ensuring environmental sustainability, and Goal 8, on developing a global partnership for development, especially the target on addressing the special needs of landlocked countries and small island developing States. Resource requirements (before recosting): $39,789,300 21.122 The activities carried out under programme support comprise conference services, library services, management of technical cooperation activities and administration and common services. 21.123 Conference services cover functions related to the provision of substantive services for the meetings of the intergovernmental organs of ECLAC, the provision of conference services to ECLAC and the publications programme and the distribution of ECLAC and United Nations Headquarters publications. Library services include providing information services to ECLAC staff members and other users of the library, the periodical publication of bulletins and bibliographies and the provision of online services to remote users. Furthermore, the ECLAC library acts as the United Nations depository library in Chile, holding copies of all the official documentation produced by the Organization. The technical cooperation activities are formulated to complement the activities carried out with regular budget resources. This component aims to strengthen and expand the economic and social research agenda and to apply research findings to the provision of advisory services and training for the benefit of ECLAC member States. Administration and common services include the provision of the overall management and coordination of administrative services, policy formulation and the establishment of managerial and administrative guidelines at ECLAC, human resource management, financial management, general support services, support and administration of the Organization's Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), language training and electronic information activities. 21.124 During the biennium 2012-2013 the following final outputs will be delivered: (a) Conference services: the activities are carried out by the Documents and Publications Division in Santiago and the Editorial, Documents and Conference Services. They relate to the provision of technical services to the meetings of policymaking organs of ECLAC and the meetings of other intergovernmental bodies held under its auspices; the provision of conference services to the meetings of policymaking organs of ECLAC and the meetings of other intergovernmental bodies held under its auspices, including translation, interpretation, editing and verbatim reporting; the publications programme and the distribution of ECLAC publications; and collaboration with the United Nations Sales Unit in the commercial distribution of United Nations publications; (b) Library services: library services are provided to ECLAC staff members and other users by the libraries in Santiago and Mexico City.

ECLAC technical cooperation activities are formulated to complement activities carried out with regular budget resources. The regular programme of technical cooperation (section 23 of the budget) is also managed by the Programme Planning and Operations Division in ECLAC to bring programmatic and substantive coherence to both those components of the technical cooperation programme carried out by ECLAC that are funded from the regular budget and extrabudgetary resources. Both components are part of a programme designed with a holistic approach and driven by the same set of substantive and programmatic priorities at the department level; they complement each other and are shaped by common logical framework models at the subprogramme level. The technical cooperation programme is geared to strengthening and expanding the economic and social research agenda and to applying research findings to the provision of advisory services and training for the benefit of ECLAC member States. It plays an active role in integrating substantive activities financed from extrabudgetary funds with those financed from the regular budget. It also aims to maintain a balance between substantive research and operational activities. The anticipated outputs during the biennium are the following: (i) Publication of reports on the activities carried out by ECLAC to support and/or promote: technical cooperation among developing countries at the regional, subregional and national levels; institutional arrangements for existing technical cooperation activities in developing member States of ECLAC; and the carrying out of operational activities in the region to promote interregional cooperation; (ii) Coordination with the technical cooperation focal points in other regional commissions for the promotion of interregional cooperation activities; (iii) Consultation with other regional organizations that carry out technical cooperation activities in Latin America and the Caribbean to identify priorities to be included in the regional programme; (iv) Collaboration with substantive units in the ECLAC system and subregional offices for the preparation and implementation of projects to promote and support technical cooperation among developing countries; (v) Provision of assistance to Governments in the identification of technical and cooperation demands and opportunities and in the preparation of project proposals; (vi) Preparation of project agreements and proposals in accordance with the operational and financial rules and procedures established by the contributing organization, institution or Government and by the United Nations; (vii) Preparation of budgets for extrabudgetary activities; (viii) Monitoring of project implementation; (ix) Administration of extrabudgetary funds in close collaboration with the substantive units responsible for the implementation of the relative projects; (d) Administration and common services: the main activities of the Division of Administration at ECLAC in Santiago are the following: (a) overall management and coordination of administrative services, policy formulation, establishment of managerial and administrative guidelines at ECLAC and oversight of administrative activities at the ECLAC subregional headquarters in Mexico City and Port of Spain and in five national offices; (b) human resources management: recruitment, placement and career development of staff, staff administration and post classification, maintenance of the classification system for General Service posts established under the relevant administrative instruction (see ST/AI/1998/9; see also ST/AI/410 and Corr.1), management of the internship programme, and provision of medical and employee assistance, general advice and individual counselling; (c) financial management and control through the establishment of procedures for the control and maintenance of regular budget and extrabudgetary funds, the implementation of financial regulations and rules and financial reporting and accounting, including treasury services; (d) general support services, including communications, transportation, procurement, facilities management and maintenance, and archives and records management; (e) language training at all ECLAC duty stations (excludes training activities funded centrally and directed by the Office of Human Resources Management); (f) IMIS support and maintenance; and (g) carrying out of electronic information activities by the Electronic Information Section in consultation with the ECLAC Information Management Committee, whose main activities are to advise the Executive Secretary on policy formulation for the automation processes at ECLAC, including with regard to the allocation of material and financial resources, to provide technical advice and support services on substantive areas, thus ensuring the appropriate functioning of the ECLAC automation platform, including the website, the Internet, communications and IMIS services; supervise the maintenance of ECLAC computer hardware and ensure the security of the Commission's information systems. Table 21.38 Resource requirements: programme support 21.125 The amount of $27,401,500 in post requirements would provide for 185 posts (1 D-1, 6 P-5, 10 P-4, 10 P-3, 14 P-2, 2 National Officer and 142 Local level), as shown in table 21.38 above. The decrease of $869,000 is due to the abolition of 1 P-4 (temporary), 1 P-2 and 3 Local level posts, as part of an efficiency measure undertaken by ECLAC. 21.126 The amount of $12,387,800 for non-post requirements would include resources for other staff costs, travel of staff, contractual services (including language teachers) and overall operating requirements. The net decrease of $671,300 is a result of lower communications costs owing to the implementation of the new telephone system, lower requirements under supplies and materials (based on expenditure patterns) and under equipment (based on the decision to delay the scheduled replacement of ECLAC furniture and information technology equipment) partly offset by requirements related to business continuity. 21.127 During the biennium 2012-2013, expected extrabudgetary resources amounting to $1,350,000, will be utilized to cover programme support costs related to various technical cooperation projects. The increase of $600,000 compared with the biennium 2010-2011 is due to the need for more full-time positions compared with the previous period. Summary of follow-up action taken to implement the relevant recommendations of the oversight bodies Brief description of the recommendation Action taken to implement the recommendation Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/64/7, chap. II, part V) The Committee requests that information on activities related to the advancement of women be provided in the proposed programme budget for 2012-2013 (para. V.59). The Division for Gender Affairs of ECLAC carries out normative and analytical work and provides assistance to countries in the area of gender mainstreaming and guidance on the promotion of gender equality within ECLAC. Office of Internal Oversight Services (AN2010/730/01) ECLAC should initiate revision of ST/SGB/2000/5 to reflect organizational changes that have occurred since the year 2000 (recommendation 1, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 1 and plans to implement it by 1 June 2011. Recommendation 1 remains open pending provision of a copy of a newly published bulletin of the Secretary-General. The ECLAC Executive Secretary should assess the level of resources (number of posts and their descriptions and grades) required for the executive direction and management function, and take steps to obtain any additional resources required for the successful discharge of this function (recommendation 2, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 2 and plans to implement it by 31 December 2011. Recommendation 2 remains open pending provision of documentation showing that it has been implemented. The ECLAC Executive Secretary should take steps to: (a) limit to the extent necessary the number of staff reporting to her; and (b) delegate additional responsibilities to the Deputy Executive Secretary, as appropriate (recommendation 3, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 3 and plans to implement it by 31 January 2011. Recommendation 3 remains open pending provision of evidence of a new organization chart and an internal memorandum establishing the reporting lines and distribution of tasks within the Office of the Executive Secretary. The Executive Office of the Secretary-General should consider issuing a directive requiring the inclusion of the regional commissions in all emergency response coordination forums to ensure that long-term economic and social development concerns are taken into consideration (recommendation 4, AN2010/730/01). The Executive Office of the Secretary-General accepted the recommendation indicating that it would need to consult with relevant parties to define the mode of engagement of the regional commissions tailoring to regional specificities and discuss how to enhance collaboration in recovery on policy and operational issues. ECLAC should prepare an action plan to address significant recommendations of the evaluation reports relating to the Caribbean subregion to ensure its relevance there (recommendation 5, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 5 and plans to implement it by 1 June 2011. ECLAC should ensure that there are adequate resources to conduct targeted internal evaluations in its biennial evaluation plan to enhance its relevance (recommendation 6, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 6 but requested correction of factual information indicating that ECLAC had had biennial evaluation plans since 2000. ECLAC should reverse $283,734 from section 33 to section 20 in accordance with the Controller's instructions once the allotments are issued under section 20 (recommendation 7, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 7 and plans to implement it by 31 December 2011. ECLAC should take the steps necessary to improve its performance against human resources action plan targets (recommendation 8, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 8 and plans to implement it by 1 July 2011. ECLAC should review its practice of insisting on the Spanish language requirement for all posts in its headquarters and identify posts for which this requirement would not be insisted upon, in order to improve the geographical representation of its staff (recommendation 9, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 9 and stated that it had already removed this requirement for most posts in its subregional office in the Caribbean and for many P-2 positions. ECLAC plans to implement the recommendation by 1 July 2011. ECLAC should develop a plan to address the uneven geographical and gender distribution of consultants from the Caribbean and other regions of the world (recommendation 10, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 10 and stated that while an even geographical distribution might be desirable, the main focus is on the specific knowledge and experience of the consultants in the region, which, by default, somewhat favour individuals from the region. ECLAC will, however, develop a plan to improve geographical and gender distribution. ECLAC plans to implement the recommendation by 31 December 2011. ECLAC should conduct periodic staff surveys to capture staff concerns and take any remedial action necessary (recommendation 11, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 11 and plans to implement it by 1 July 2011. ECLAC should clearly establish its knowledge management objectives and a governance system and seek necessary resources for its implementation (recommendation 12, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 12 and plans to implement it by 31 December 2011. ECLAC should update and approve its business continuity plan incorporating the lessons learned checklist, and implement the recommendations of the "after-action report" (recommendation 13, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 13 and plans to implement it by 1 June 2011. ECLAC should develop business continuity plans for its subregional and national offices (recommendation 14, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 14 and plans to implement it by 1 July 2011. ECLAC should review the General Services section's organization structure in order to segregate requisitioning, procurement, and receiving and inspection functions (recommendation 15, AN2010/730/01). ECLAC accepted recommendation 15 and stated that the General Services section had been reorganized after the visit of the auditors, as at 1 October 2010.
