General Assembly Sixty-eighth session Agenda item 35 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Sixty-ninth year Identical letters dated 19 March 2014 from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government, I wish to transmit the following information from the Ministry of Defence in response to the allegations contained in the letter dated 7 February 2014 (S/2014/86) from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations: Israel has fabricated imaginary violations to make it appear that the Lebanese side has committed a high number of violations. In describing those incidents, it uses the term "armed men" to deceive the United Nations and suggest that armed irregulars are present in the area of operations of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). However, the persons referred to are in fact hunters. The Ministry stresses that Israel's claims are incorrect. The violations reported by UNIFIL were committed by shepherds and amateur hunters. They cannot be compared to the land, air and sea violations deliberately perpetrated by Israel. I should be grateful if the present letter could be circulated as a document of sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 35, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Nawaf Salam Ambassador Permanent Representative
