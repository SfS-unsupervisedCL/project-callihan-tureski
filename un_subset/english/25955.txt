Fifty-eighth session Agenda item 32 Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) Letter dated 28 July 2004 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General In accordance with instructions received from my Government, I have the honour to refer to the letter of 8 June 2004 from the Permanent Representative of Argentina addressed to you (A/58/840). Her Majesty's Government rejects the contents of the letter. As the Government of the Argentine Republic has been informed on several occasions, there is no substance to these claims. The change in titles to Head Quarters British Forces South Atlantic Islands and Commander British Forces South Atlantic Islands simply reflects changes in administrative structures. There has been no change in the mission or role of the Armed Forces of the United Kingdom providing security for the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The United Kingdom has no doubts about its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and their surrounding maritime areas. I should be grateful if you would arrange for the text of the present letter to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 32. (Signed) Emyr Jones Parry
