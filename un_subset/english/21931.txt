Item 14 of the provisional agenda* Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency Note by the Secretary-General** 1. The forty-eighth report of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the calendar year 2003 (GC(48)/3) is submitted herewith to the General Assembly. Major developments since the report was published will be covered by the annual statement of the Director-General of the Agency to the General Assembly. The report has been transmitted in accordance with the provisions of article III, paragraph 1 (a), of the Agreement governing the relationship between the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (General Assembly resolution 1145 (XII), annex). 2. As only a limited number of copies of the report are available, it has not been possible to make a full distribution. Delegations are therefore requested to have the copies transmitted to them available during discussion of this item.
