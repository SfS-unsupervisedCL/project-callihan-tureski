Stresses that eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly for developing countries; "2. Stresses also that the deep fault line that divides human society between the rich and the poor and the ever-increasing gap between the developed and developing worlds pose a major threat to global prosperity, security and stability; "3. Stresses further that the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty should contribute to achieving the targets of halving, by 2015, the proportion of the world's people whose income is less than one dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, through decisive national action and strengthened international cooperation; "4. Recognizes the major role trade can play as an engine of growth and development and in eradicating poverty, and in this context stresses the need for expeditious and complete integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition into the international trading system, in full cognizance of the opportunities and challenges of globalization and liberalization and taking into account the circumstances of individual countries, in particular the trade interests and development needs of developing countries; "5. Welcomes the decision contained in the Doha Ministerial Declaration to place the needs and interests of developing countries at the heart of the Work Programme of the Declaration, including through enhanced market access in products of interest to developing countries; "6. Recognizes that a substantial increase in official development assistance and other resources will be required if developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, are to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and in this regard calls up on those countries that made announcements of increased official development assistance at the International Conference on Financing for Development to make available these commitments as soon as possible; "7. Expresses its appreciation to the developed countries that have agreed to and have reached the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for overall official development assistance, and calls upon the developed countries that have not yet done so to strengthen their efforts to achieve the agreed target as soon as possible and, where agreed, within that target, to earmark 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of their gross national product for the least developed countries; "8. Stresses that external debt and debt-servicing have a heavy impact on developing countries, in particular the poorest, most heavily indebted countries, hinder their efforts to eradicate poverty, pre-empt large proportions of Governments' expenditures and reduce scarce resources available for public social services and economic development, hence emphasizes that external debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that can then be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development; "9. Calls for the full, speedy and effective implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which should be fully financed through additional resources, encourages participation in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative of all creditors that have not yet done so and, in this regard, stresses the need for the donor community to provide the additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Initiative, hence welcomes the agreement that financing for heavily indebted poor countries should be reviewed analytically and separately from International Development Association replenishment requirements but immediately after meetings for the thirty-eighth replenishment of the Association, and calls upon all donors to participate fully in this process; "10. Calls upon the developed countries, by means of intensified and effective cooperation with the developing countries, to promote capacity-building and facilitate access to and transfer of technologies and corresponding knowledge, in particular to developing countries, on favourable terms, including concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed, taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights, as well as the special needs of developing countries, by identifying and implementing practical steps to ensure the achievement of progress in this regard and to assist developing countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in an era influenced in large measure by technology; "11. Recognizes the importance of disseminating best practices for the reduction of poverty in its various dimensions, taking into account the need to adapt these best practices to suit the social, economic, cultural and historical conditions of each country; "12. Reaffirms that the eradication of poverty should be addressed in an integrated way, as set out in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, taking into account the sectoral strategies in such areas as education, development of human resources, health, human settlements, rural development, productive employment, population, environment, freshwater, food security and migration, and the specific needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, in such a way to increase opportunities and choices for people living in poverty and to enable them to build and to strengthen their assets so as to achieve social and economic development, security and stability; "13. Expresses its concern that, despite a decrease in the number of undernourished people in some developing countries during the 1990s, nearly two thirds of these countries recorded either no change or an increase in the number of undernourished people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and that at current rates of progress, the goal to halve the proportion of undernourished people by 2015 is likely to be achieved in some regions but not in others, such as in sub-Saharan Africa; "14. Emphasizes the link between poverty eradication and improving access to safe drinking water, and stresses in this regard the objective to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water and the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation, as reaffirmed in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation; "15. Recognizes that the lack of adequate housing remains a pressing challenge in the fight to eradicate extreme poverty, particularly in the urban areas in developing countries, and in this regard expresses its concern at the rapid growth of slum-dwellers in the urban areas of developing countries, particularly in Africa, and stresses that unless drastic measures and actions are taken at the national and international levels, the number of slum-dwellers, who constitute one third of the world's urban population, will continue to increase; "16. Emphasizes the critical role of both formal and non-formal education, particularly basic education and training, in particular for girls, in the empowerment of those living in poverty, and in this context reaffirms the Dakar Framework for Action adopted at the World Education Forum, and recognizes the importance of the UNESCO strategy for poverty eradication, especially extreme poverty, in supporting the Education For All programmes as a tool to achieve the Dakar goals as well as the Millennium Development goals; "17. Recognizes the devastating effect of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic on human development, economic growth and poverty reduction efforts in many countries, in particular sub-Saharan African countries, and urges Governments and the international community to give urgent priority to the HIV/AIDS crisis, in particular addressing the special needs of developing countries through strengthened cooperation and assistance as well as through the implementation of commitments undertaken, as agreed in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session in June 2001; "18. Emphasizes the role of microcredit as an important anti-poverty tool that promotes production and self-employment and empowers people living in poverty, especially women, and therefore encourages Governments to adopt policies that support microcredit schemes and the development of microfinance institutions and their capacities; "19. Reaffirms that all Governments and the United Nations system should promote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies and programmes aimed at the eradication of poverty, at both the national and the international levels, and encourages the use of gender analysis as a tool for the integration of a gender dimension into planning the implementation of policies, strategies and programmes for the eradication of poverty; "20. Stresses, as recognized in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the importance of meeting the special needs of Africa, where poverty remains a major challenge and where most countries have not benefited fully from the opportunities of globalization, further exacerbating the continent's marginalization; "21. Welcomes the New Partnership for Africa's development as a programme of the African Union whose primary objective is to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development, and urges the United Nations system and the international community, in particular donor countries, to assist with the implementation of the New Partnership; "22. Stresses that the goal of halving extreme poverty by 2015 will not be achieved without serious efforts to address the development needs of the least developed countries and to support their efforts in improving the lives of their people, and in this regard calls upon the national Governments of the least developed countries and their development partners to implement fully the commitments contained in the Brussels Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010, adopted at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Brussels from 14 to 20 May 2001; "23. Reaffirms the role of United Nations funds and programmes, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, in assisting the national efforts of developing countries, inter alia, in the eradication of poverty, and the need for their funding in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations; "24. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution; "25. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session the item entitled `Implementation of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006)'." 11.

Stresses that eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, in particular for developing countries, and that, although each country has the primary responsibility for its own sustainable development and poverty eradication and the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized, concerted and concrete measures are required at all levels to enable developing countries to achieve their sustainable development goals as related to the internationally agreed poverty-related targets and goals; 2. Also stresses that the deep fault line that divides human society between the rich and the poor and the ever-increasing gap between the developed and developing worlds pose a major threat to global prosperity, security and stability; 3. Reaffirms that good governance at the international level is fundamental for achieving poverty eradication and sustainable development; that, in order to ensure a dynamic and enabling international economic environment, it is important to promote global economic governance through addressing the international finance, trade, technology and investment patterns that have an impact on the development prospects of developing countries; that, to that end, the international community should take all necessary and appropriate measures, including ensuring support to structural and macroeconomic reform, a comprehensive solution to the external debt problem and increasing market access for developing countries; that efforts to reform the international financial architecture need to be sustained with greater transparency and the effective participation of developing countries in decision-making processes; and that a universal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, as well as meaningful trade liberalization, can substantially stimulate development worldwide, benefiting countries at all stages of development; 4. Also reaffirms that good governance at the national level is essential for poverty eradication and sustainable development; that sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and employment creation; and that freedom, peace and security, domestic stability, respect for human rights, including the right to development, and the rule of law, gender equality, market-oriented policies and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing; 5. Further stresses that the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty should contribute to achieving the targets of halving, by 2015, the proportion of the world's people whose income is less than one dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, through decisive national action and strengthened international cooperation as part of an integrated approach to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration; 6. Reaffirms that the eradication of poverty should be addressed in an integrated way, as set out in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, taking into account the importance of the need for the empowerment of women and the sectoral strategies in such areas as education, development of human resources, health, human settlements, rural, local and community development, productive employment, population, environment, water and sanitation, food security, energy and migration, and the specific needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, in such a way as to increase opportunities and choices for people living in poverty and to enable them to build and to strengthen their assets so as to achieve development, security and stability, and in that regard encourages countries to develop their national poverty reduction policies in accordance with their national priorities, including, where appropriate, through poverty reduction strategy papers; 7. Stresses the importance of increasing access to and control over resources, including land, skills, knowledge, capital and social connections, for the poor, in particular women, and of improving access for all to basic social services; 8. Recognizes the major role that trade can play as an engine of growth and development and in eradicating poverty, and in that context stresses the need for expeditious and complete integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition into the international trading system, in full cognizance of the opportunities and challenges of globalization and liberalization and taking into account the circumstances of individual countries, in particular the trade interests and development needs of developing countries; 9. Welcomes the decision contained in the Ministerial Declaration, adopted at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization,12 to place the needs and interests of developing countries at the heart of the work programme adopted at the Conference, including through enhanced market access for products of interest to developing countries; 10. Recognizes that a substantial increase in official development assistance and other resources will be required if developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, are to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and that, to build support for official development assistance, cooperation is necessary to further improve policies and development strategies to enhance aid effectiveness, both nationally and internationally, and in that regard requests those countries that made announcements of increased official development assistance at the International Conference on Financing for Development to make those resources available as soon as possible; 11. Urges developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts to reach the targets of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national product to least developed countries, as reconfirmed at the Third United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, encourages developing countries to build on progress achieved in ensuring that official development assistance is used effectively to help achieve development goals and targets, acknowledges the efforts of all donors, commends those donors whose official development assistance contributions exceed, reach or are increasing towards the targets, and underlines the importance of undertaking to examine the means and time frames for achieving the targets and goals; 12. Recognizes that an enabling domestic environment is vital for mobilizing domestic resources, increasing productivity, reducing capital flight, encouraging the private sector, and attracting and making effective use of international investment and assistance, and that efforts to create such an environment should be supported by the international community; 13. Notes with great concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the heavily indebted poor developing countries as constituting an element that adversely affects their sustainable development efforts, noting in that regard that the total debt stock of the developing countries rose from $1,458 billion in 1990 to $2,442 billion in 2001, recognizes that creditors and debtors must share the responsibility for preventing and resolving unsustainable debt situations and that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals contained in the Millennium Declaration, and in that regard urges countries to direct those resources freed through debt relief, in particular through debt cancellation and reduction, towards those objectives; 14. Calls for the full, speedy and effective implementation of the enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative, which should be fully financed through additional resources, encourages the participation in the initiative of all creditors that have not yet participated, and stresses in that regard the need for the donor community to provide the additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the initiative; welcomes, therefore, the agreement that financing for heavily indebted poor countries should be reviewed analytically and separately from International Development Association replenishment requirements, but back-to-back with meetings for the fourteenth replenishment of the Association, and calls upon all donors to participate fully in that process; 15. Calls upon the developed countries, by means of intensified and effective cooperation with developing countries, to promote capacity-building and facilitate access to and transfer of technologies and corresponding knowledge, in particular to developing countries, on favourable terms, including concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed, taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights, as well as the special needs of developing countries, by identifying and implementing practical steps to ensure the achievement of progress in that regard and to assist developing countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in an era influenced in large measure by technology; 16. Recognizes the responsibility of all Governments to adopt policies aimed at preventing and combating corrupt practices at the national and international levels; 17. Recognizes also the importance of disseminating best practices for the reduction of poverty in its various dimensions, taking into account the need to adapt those best practices to suit the social, economic, cultural and historical conditions of each country; 18. Expresses its concern that, despite a decrease in the number of undernourished people in some developing countries during the 1990s, nearly two thirds of those countries recorded either no change or an increase in the number of undernourished people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and that, at current rates of progress, the target to halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by 2015 is likely to be achieved in some regions but not in others, including sub-Saharan Africa, unless substantially strengthened efforts are made at all levels in order to achieve food security; 19. Emphasizes the link between poverty eradication and improving access to safe drinking water, and stresses in that regard the objective to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water and the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation, as reaffirmed in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation;14 20. Recognizes that the lack of adequate housing remains a pressing challenge in the fight to eradicate extreme poverty, particularly in the urban areas in developing countries, expresses its concern at the rapid growth of slum dwellers in the urban areas of developing countries, particularly in Africa, stresses that unless urgent and effective measures and actions are taken at the national and international levels, the number of slum dwellers, who constitute one third of the world's urban population, will continue to increase, and emphasizes the need for increased efforts with a view to significantly improving the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020; 21. Welcomes the efforts made to implement the 20/20 initiative, which emphasizes that promoting access for all to basic social services is essential for sustainable and equitable development and is an integral part of the strategy for the eradication of poverty; 22. Emphasizes the critical role of both formal and non-formal education, in particular basic education and training, especially for girls, in the empowerment of those living in poverty, reaffirms in that context the Dakar Framework for Action adopted at the World Education Forum, and recognizes the importance of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization strategy for poverty eradication, especially extreme poverty, in supporting the Education For All programmes as a tool to achieve, inter alia, universal primary education by 2015; 23. Recognizes the devastating effect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on human development, economic growth and poverty reduction efforts in many countries, in particular sub-Saharan African countries, and urges Governments and the international community to give urgent priority to the HIV/AIDS crisis, by addressing in particular the special needs of developing countries through strengthened cooperation and assistance as well as through the implementation of commitments undertaken, as agreed in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session, in June 2001; 24. Emphasizes the role of microcredit as an important anti-poverty tool that promotes production and self-employment and empowers people living in poverty, especially women, and therefore encourages Governments to adopt policies that support microcredit schemes and the development of microfinance institutions and their capacities; 25. Reaffirms that all Governments and the United Nations system should promote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies and programmes aimed at the eradication of poverty, at both the national and the international levels, and encourages the use of gender analysis as a tool for the integration of a gender dimension into planning the implementation of policies, strategies and programmes for the eradication of poverty; 26. Stresses, as recognized in the Millennium Declaration, the importance of meeting the special needs of Africa, where poverty remains a major challenge and where most countries have not benefited fully from the opportunities of globalization, which has further exacerbated the continent's marginalization; 27. Welcomes the New Partnership for Africa's Development as a programme of the African Union, the primary objective of which is to eradicate poverty and promote sustainable development on the basis of African ownership and leadership and enhanced partnership with the international community, and urges the developed countries and the United Nations system to support the Partnership and complement the efforts undertaken by Africa to overcome the challenges it faces; 28. Stresses that the goal of halving the proportion of people living on less than one dollar a day by 2015 will not be achieved without serious efforts to address the development needs of the least developed countries and to support their efforts to improve the lives of their people, and in that regard calls upon the national Governments of the least developed countries and their development partners to implement fully the commitments contained in the Brussels Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010,15 adopted at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held at Brussels from 14 to 20 May 2001; 29. Reaffirms the role of United Nations funds and programmes, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, in assisting the national efforts of developing countries, inter alia, in the eradication of poverty, and the need for their funding in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations; 30. Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on the implementation of the present resolution; 31. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session the item entitled "Implementation of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006)".
