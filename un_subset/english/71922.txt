Letter dated 7 March 2014 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to refer to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which the Security Council established by resolution 1542 (2004) and most recently extended by resolution 2119 (2013). Following the usual consultations, I should like to inform you of my intention to appoint Lieutenant General Jos√© Luiz Jaborandy Jr. (Brazil) as the new Force Commander of MINUSTAH. He will succeed Lieutenant General Edson Leal Pujol (Brazil), who will complete his assignment on 15 March 2014. I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Lieutenant General Pujol for his dedication and effective leadership. I should be grateful if you would bring this letter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) BAN Ki-moon
