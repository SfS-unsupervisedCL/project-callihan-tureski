Resumed organizational session for 2011 27 and 28 April 2011 Agenda item 2 Adoption of the agenda and other organizational matters Letter dated 24 March 2011 from the Permanent Representative of France to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Economic and Social Council I have the honour to inform you that France wishes to become a member of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti. France maintains strong historic links with that country, which is also a member of la Francophonie, and provides it with considerable development assistance aimed at enabling it to develop its infrastructure and institutions and improve its social, political and economic circumstances. France is well acquainted with, and holds in high regard, the development capacities of the Economic and Social Council, considering them vital to countries like Haiti. Past reports of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group provide valuable insight into key issues affecting Haiti. France consequently wishes to play an active role in this joint effort and to bring to the Ad Hoc Advisory Group its input and experience. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated to the members of the Economic and Social Council. (Signed) GÃ©rard Araud Ambassador Permanent Representative
