The programme is guided by the Administrative and Budgetary (Fifth) Committee of the General Assembly and the Committee for Programme and Coordination. 28B.2 The activities programmed under this section fall within subprogramme 2, Programme planning, budget and accounts, of programme 24, Management and support services, of the strategic framework for the period 2010-2011. 28B.3 The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts: (a) Administers and ensures compliance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation, and relevant legislative mandates; (b) Establishes and applies the budgetary and accounting policies and procedures of the United Nations, in accordance with the financial regulations and rules and relevant standards; (c) Ensures sound financial management of all resources made available to the Organization, as well as their effective and efficient use, directly or through delegation of authority and/or instructions to other offices of the United Nations at Headquarters and overseas; (d) Accounts for and reports to the appropriate authorities on the use made of United Nations financial resources; (e) Facilitates intergovernmental deliberations by the General Assembly and decision-making bodies on the issues of planning, programming, budgeting and accounts of the Organization; (f) Implements and operates the financial components of the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), which will be replaced by the Enterprise Resource Planning system, in particular by providing specifications for changes and conducting user acceptance tests, support of the departments and offices with delegated administrative authority and monitoring of the operations of the system. 28B.4 The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts carries out its activities in cooperation with other departments and offices of the Secretariat and, as appropriate, other entities of the United Nations system. Such collaboration and cooperation include the preparation of reports, participation in meetings, briefings, technical and substantive support and the sharing of information and experience. 28B.5 The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts continues to improve its operations in accordance with the findings of external reviews carried out in prior bienniums of the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the organizational structure, staffing, management framework and operations and the global treasury operations at the United Nations Secretariat and several offices away from Headquarters, and their treasury management capabilities. 28B.6 The accepted findings from those reviews were incorporated in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, resulting in both organizational changes and the realignment of resources to ensure that activities implemented from all sources of funding are directed at improving internal controls; enhancing risk management; streamlining processes (in particular in the area of receipt, disbursement and processing of assessed contributions); strengthening information technology services; improving financial management, reporting and accounts; and improving services to meet clients' needs. During the biennium 2010-2011, the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts will continue to focus on further refining results-based budgeting and results-based management, including improvements in budget presentation, carry out periodic self-evaluations and strengthen cooperation with other departmental partners on monitoring and evaluation. It will participate actively in the configuration and deployment of the Enterprise Resource Planning system and carry out activities to ensure implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. 28B.7 The proposals herein do not address those elements directly related to support of peacekeeping operations, which would be funded from the peacekeeping support account; rather, they address only those elements directly related to activities financed under the regular budget. The responsibilities of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts are detailed in the most recent Secretary-General's bulletin for the Office. 28B.8 The specific objectives, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement of the main organizational units of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts in the biennium 2010-2011 are detailed, together with resources, under executive direction and management and the programme of work. 28B.9 The overall level of resources for the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts under the regular budget amounts to $39,104,100 before recosting, reflecting a 3.8 per cent net decrease of $1,541,600 against the revised appropriation for the biennium 2008-2009. The net decrease, as shown in table 28B.4, can be summarized as follows: (a) The net decrease of $2,235,700 under executive direction and management represents one-time costs largely related to consultants and training requirements in connection with the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards as well as nonrecurrent operating expenses related to the establishment in 2008-2009 of two new posts in the Office of the Deputy Controller ($3,376,000). The decrease is offset in part by increased requirements of $397,100 related to the delayed impact of the two new posts established in 2008-2009 in respect of the re-establishment of the Office of the Deputy Controller (1 D-2, 1 P-4) and increased non-post requirements of $743,200 broadly related to the realignment of the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards in efforts to synchronize the implementation of the Standards and the Enterprise Resource Planning project; (b) The net increase of $694,100 under programme of work represents: (i) A net increase of $172,900 under Programme planning and budgeting, comprising an increase of $190,200 for posts owing to the delayed impact resulting from the establishment of one post at the P-5 level during the biennium 2008-2009, offset in part by a net decrease of $17,300 for non-post resources broadly related to one-time costs under consultants and experts; (ii) A net increase of $328,000 under Accounting, contributions and financial reporting, comprising an increase of $162,500 for posts owing to the delayed impact resulting from the establishment of one post at the P-4 level during the biennium 2008-2009 and increased requirements of $165,500 for non-post resources resulting from the increase in service level agreement costs for common support services to office automation provided by the Office of Information and Communications Technology; (iii) A net increase of $18,800 under Treasury, owing to increased non-post requirements broadly related to travel of staff; (iv) A net increase of $174,400 under Financial information operations, comprising an increase of $216,000 for posts owing to the delayed impact resulting from the establishment of one post at the D-1 level during the biennium 2008-2009, offset in part by a decrease of $41,600 for non-post resources broadly related to contractual services. 28B.10 It is estimated that during the biennium 2010-2011, extrabudgetary resources of $57,010,900, representing 58.1 per cent of overall resource requirements, would be utilized to supplement resources from the regular budget for the activities carried out by the Office of the Controller and substantive activities under the programme of work. This includes an amount of $36,842,500 from the support account for peacekeeping operations, $17,472,400 from programme support income received as reimbursement for services provided by the central administration for extrabudgetary activities, funds and programmes, and $2,696,000 from other extrabudgetary resources. The projected level represents an increase of approximately $8,474,000 over the biennium 2008-2009, arising from increased requirements under the support account. 28B.11 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269, resources were identified within the available capacity in the Professional and General Service categories for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation in the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts equivalent to 206 work-months of staff, or $2,991,100 ($2,380,700 funded from the regular budget and $610,400 from extrabudgetary resources). 28B.12 The percentage distribution of the total resources of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts in 2010-2011 is shown in table 28B.3, and the distribution of resources is summarized in tables 28B.4 and 28B.5.

Resource requirements (before recosting): $5,535,300 28B.13 The Assistant Secretary-General, Controller, is responsible for all the activities of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, and supervises five organizational entities, namely, the Programme Planning and Budget Division, the Peacekeeping Financing Division, the Accounts Division, the Treasury and the Financial Information Operations Service. The Assistant SecretaryGeneral, Controller, administers, as delegated, the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and ensures compliance therewith; advises the Secretary-General and the Under-Secretary-General for Management on policy matters with respect to the budget, plans, work programmes and finances of the United Nations; represents the Secretary-General in the committees of the General Assembly, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Committee for Programme and Coordination in the presentation of the budget outline, the biennial programme budgets, the budgets of the International Tribunals, the strategic framework, the United Nations capital master plan budget and the peacekeeping budgets and budget performance reports; represents the Secretary-General in other bodies and working groups of the United Nations system and in other international forums on budgetary and financial matters; establishes budgetary and accounting policies, procedures and guidelines for the Organization; exercises financial control of the resources of the Organization; and designates and approves staff members whose functions involve significant financial duties, where this authority is to be exercised by the Controller pursuant to existing rules. 28B.14 The Office of the Assistant Secretary-General, Controller, provides assistance in the overall direction, supervision and management of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts; discharges responsibilities as delegated to the Assistant Secretary-General, Controller, under the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations; formulates policy papers, reports and guidelines and provides advice on planning, programming and budgetary and accounting matters; evaluates, reviews and formulates the terms and conditions of the delegation of the Controller's authority and responsibility under the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and monitors the application thereof; reviews all financial agreements outlining the terms and conditions of voluntary contributions, including contributions in kind and non-reimbursable loans in compliance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations; and coordinates interdepartmental activities relating to planning, programming and budgetary and accounting matters. 28B.15 Further to resolution 60/283, by which the General Assembly approved the adoption by the United Nations of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards, the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Implementation Unit was established in the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General, Controller, during the biennium 2006-2007. The Unit is responsible for transitioning the Organization to the requirements under the Standards. For the biennium 2010-2011, the Unit will, inter alia, further develop and document International Public Sector Accounting Standards accounting policies, guidance and procedures in synchronization with the new enterprise resource planning project; ensure effective communications with the broader United Nations finance community, oversee and undertake training programmes for finance personnel; coordinate a comprehensive analysis of the Organization's fixed assets and balance sheet accounts required for an International Public Sector Accounting Standards-compliant opening position; and propose revisions of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations arising from the adoption of the Standards. 28B.16 It should be recalled that in its resolution 62/236, the General Assembly endorsed the proposal of the Secretary-General vis-à-vis the re-establishment of the office and functions of the Deputy Controller as of the biennium 2008-2009. The Deputy Controller at the D-2 level oversees the overall management of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts and provides guidance to the financial community of the Organization. The responsibility of the Deputy Controller is to respond to the identified need to improve timeliness and to ensure comprehensive review and approval of administrative actions. This also includes providing the management resources necessary to lead operational initiatives, review extrabudgetary financing and respond promptly to and follow up on implementation of the growing number of oversight recommendations made by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Joint Inspection Unit and the Board of Auditors. This enables appropriate burden-sharing between the Controller and the Deputy Controller in addressing the complex and critical financial management issues in a proactive manner. Table 28B.6 Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures Objective of the Organization: To facilitate full implementation of legislative mandates and compliance with United Nations policies and procedures with respect to the management of financial resources of the Organization and management of the programme of work and staff of the Office.

Outputs 28B.18 During the biennium 2010-2011, the following final outputs will be delivered: (a) Servicing of intergovernmental/expert bodies (regular budget and extrabudgetary): approximately 25 meetings of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions; approximately 12 meetings of the Committee for Programme and Coordination; and approximately 35 formal and informal meetings of the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly; (b) Other substantive activities (regular budget and extrabudgetary): representation at and convening of meetings with financial officials of the Secretariat, offices away from Headquarters and United Nations funds and programmes on issues of common concern (approximately 8 meetings); (c) Advisory services (regular budget and extrabudgetary): (i) Advice on voluntary contribution financial agreements entered into between the United Nations and, inter alia, Governments, non-governmental organizations and private contributors (500); (ii) Assistance to clients on the application of the Financial Regulations and Rules, procedures and policies (80); (d) Administrative support and finance services (regular budget and extrabudgetary): review and authorization of delegations of authority as they relate to financial matters, including review and approval of requests for clearance of staff members designated to perform significant functions in the management of financial resources in accordance with Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2005/7 (480); training workshops on financial issues for chief administrative officers and chief finance officers (4); training workshops on the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (23); (e) Revision of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations to incorporate modifications as required by the adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. Table 28B.7 Resource requirements: executive direction and management Resources (thousands of United States dollars) (before recosting) Post Non-post 28B.19 Resources amounting to $5,535,300 reflecting a decrease of $2,235,700 would provide for the continuation of 10 posts (7 in the Professional and above category and 3 in the General Service category) ($3,331,000) and non-post requirements ($2,204,300) relating to other staff costs, consultants, travel of staff, contractual services and other operating requirements in the Office of the Assistant Secretary-General, Controller. The increase under posts ($397,100) reflects the delayed impact of two new posts (1 D-2, 1 P-4) established during the biennium 2008-2009 in connection with the re-establishment of the Office of the Deputy Controller. The reduction of $2,632,800 in non-post requirements is the net effect of one-time operating costs related to the establishment in 2008-2009 of two new posts in the Office of the Deputy Controller, and consultants and training requirements in connection with the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. The reduction is offset in part by increased requirements for general temporary assistance to support the process of data clean-up of non-expendable property and expendable items that will require capitalization under the International Public Sector Accounting Standards. 28B.20 This component of the subprogramme is supported by extrabudgetary resources amounting to $6,487,000, including five posts (4 Professional and 1 General Service) whose incumbents are engaged in administrative support and financial services relating to coordination of audit and oversight recommendations, monitoring and evaluation, voluntary contribution financial agreements entered into between the United Nations and Governments, non-governmental organizations, private contributors, assistance to clients on application of the Financial Regulations and Rules, procedures and policies, and review and authorization of delegations of authority as they relate to financial matters. The volume of extrabudgetary resource requirements in comparison to the biennium 2008-2009 remains largely unchanged except for the requirements anticipated under peacekeeping resources related to the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards.

Accounting contributions and financial reporting Regular budget resource requirements by component Resource requirements (before recosting): $9,836,500 28B.21 Responsibility for programme planning and budgeting rests with the Programme Planning and Budget Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts. This component will be implemented in accordance with the strategy detailed under component 1, Programme planning and budgeting, of subprogramme 2, Programme planning, budget and accounts of programme 24, Management and Support Services of the strategic framework for the period 2010-2011 (A/63/6/Rev.1).

Resource requirements: programme planning and budgeting 28B.24 Resources amounting to $9,836,500, reflecting a net increase of $172,900 would provide for the continuation of 33 posts, including 23 posts in the Professional and above category and 10 posts in the General Service category ($9,594,900), and non-post requirements ($241,600), including other staff costs, travel of staff, contractual services, general operating expenses, supplies and materials, and furniture and equipment. The increase under posts ($190,200) reflects the delayed impact of one post at the P-5 level established during the biennium 2008-2009. The net decrease in non-post resources ($17,300) relates broadly to one-time costs under consultancy and reduced requirements under other staff costs, general operating expenses and furniture and equipment, offset in part by increased requirements under contractual services owing to increased unit rates applied to information technology services by the Office of Information and Communications Technology. 28B.25 This component of the subprogramme is supported by extrabudgetary resources amounting to $2,194,300, including nine posts (five Professional and four General Service) that will complement regular budget resources to service intergovernmental bodies and provide substantive and administrative support in financial and budgetary issues, including substantive servicing of meetings and the preparation of parliamentary documentation. The decrease in extrabudgetary resource requirements in comparison to the biennium 2008-2009 reflects the proposed reduction of one post at the P-4 level owing to reduced extrabudgetary resources. 2.

Resource requirements: financial services relating to peacekeeping matters 28B.29 The resource requirements of the Division are financed exclusively from the peacekeeping support account. The requirements for the biennium 2010-2011 reflect the proposed conversion of four general temporary assistance positions at the P-3 level to established posts and the reclassification of one post from the P-3 to the P-4 level, to be considered by the General Assembly at its resumed sixty-third session in May 2009 (see A/63/767). 3. Component 3: Accounting, contributions and financial reporting Resource requirements (before recosting): $18,445,700 28B.30 Substantive responsibility for this component is vested in the Accounts Division of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts. The Accounts Division currently comprises the Office of the Director, the Financial Reporting Service (Central Accounts Section, Peacekeeping Accounts Section, Trust Funds and Technical Cooperation Section), Insurance and Disbursement Service (Health and Life Insurance Section, Payroll and Disbursement Section, Commercial Insurance and Compensation Section including the secretariat of the Advisory Board on Compensation Claims and the United Nations Claims Board) and the Contributions and Policy Coordination Service. This component will be implemented in accordance with the strategy detailed under component 3, Accounting, contributions and financial reporting, of subprogramme 2, Programme planning, budget and accounts, of programme 24, Management and Support Services, of the strategic framework for the period 2010-2011 (A/63/6/Rev.1).

Table 28B.14 Resource requirements: accounting, contributions and financial reporting 28B.33 Resources amounting to $18,445,700, reflecting an increase of $328,000, would provide for the continuation of 82 posts, including 28 in the Professional and above category and 54 in the General Service category ($17,426,800), and non-post requirements ($1,018,900), including other staff costs, travel of staff, contractual services, general operating expenses, supplies and materials, and furniture and equipment. The increase under posts ($162,500) reflects the delayed impact of one post at the P-4 level established during the biennium 2008-2009. The net increase in non-post resources ($165,500) relates broadly to travel of staff and contractual services owing to increased unit rates applied to information technology services by the Office of Information and Communications Technology. 28B.34 This component is supported by extrabudgetary resources amounting to $25,108,300, including 108 posts (37 Professional and 71 General Service) that will be used to complement regular budget resources to provide substantive, administrative and financial services. The volume of resources in comparison to the biennium 2008-2009 remains largely unchanged except for the increase anticipated under peacekeeping resources. 4. Component 4: Treasury services Resource requirements (before recosting): $1,703,500 28B.35 This component is the responsibility of the Treasury of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts. It will be implemented in accordance with the strategy detailed under component 4, Treasury services, of subprogramme 2, Programme planning, budget and accounts, of programme 24, Management and Support Services, of the strategic framework for the period 2010-2011 (A/63/6/Rev.1). Table 28B.15 Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures Objective of the Organization: To ensure the prudent investment of funds and to improve cash-management actions. (a) Continued prudent stewardship of funds (a) (i) The return on the United States dollar investment pool is equal to or above the 90-day United States Treasury bill rate of return 2006-2007: 4.07 per cent Estimate 2008-2009: 4.25 per cent Target 2010-2011: 1.5 per cent (ii) The return on the euro investment pool is equal to or above the Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA) rate of return 2006-2007: 3.29 per cent Estimate 2008-2009: 3.75 per cent Target 2010-2011: 0.50 per cent (b) Improved efficiency and security of the payment system (b) (i) Maintenance of a loss-free record in safeguarding financial resources (Cash loss incidents) 2006-2007: zero Estimate 2008-2009: zero Target 2010-2011: zero (ii) Increased percentage of automatic disbursements through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) 2006-2007: 94 per cent (iii) Reduced number of bank accounts Estimate 2008-2009: 459 Target 2010-2011: 475 28B.36 The Treasury is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments based on current levels of interest rates. Economic conditions beyond the control of the Treasury could lead to an adverse change in interest rates, consequently reducing the actual return on investments. Conditions in countries which host United Nations field operations, United Nations offices away from Headquarters, programmes and funds beyond the control of Treasury could lead to an increase in the number of bank accounts needed to be established. 28B.37 During the biennium 2010-2011, the following outputs will be delivered: administrative support and finance services (regular budget and extrabudgetary); bank accounts worldwide administered; cash balances reconciled daily and multicurrency investment accounting properly booked and transmitted to the Accounts Division; cash management and cashier functions assessed and all missions advised on Treasury policies and procedures to safeguard financial resources; cash position and forecast computed, as requested; multicurrency liquidity maintained to meet peacekeeping missions' cash requirements; secure and loss-free management of the investment funds pool for the United Nations regular budget, peacekeeping operations, general trust funds, technical cooperation funds, the escrow account, the United Nations Environment Programme fund and others for liquidity and maximizing the rate of return; and worldwide cross-border payments processed in a timely manner, as requested, including the salaries of peacekeeping personnel. Table 28B.16 Resource requirements: Treasury services 28B.38 Resources amounting to $1,703,500, reflecting a net increase of $18,800, would provide for the continuation of five posts, including three in the Professional and above category and two in the General Service category ($1,582,000), and non-post requirements ($121,500), including other staff costs, travel of staff, contractual services, general operating expenses, supplies and materials, and furniture and equipment. The increase of $18,800 relates to the increased requirements under travel of staff and replacement of office automation equipment. 28B.39 This component is supported by extrabudgetary resources amounting to $3,907,100, including 11 posts (5 Professional and 6 General Service) to perform various banking functions for peacekeeping and other support accounts; make investment decisions on behalf of all support funds; process payments to all missions, international peacekeeping personnel, troop-contributing countries, Member States, and vendors; implement and update missions' cash transportation and storage policies and procedures; assess cash management and cashier functions, and provide advice on Treasury policies and procedures at all missions to safeguard financial resource; implement model banking agreements between missions and local financial institutions; liaise with banks worldwide to process cross-border payments, as requested, by the peacekeeping missions, troop-contributing countries and Member States. The volume of resources in comparison to the biennium 2008-2009 remains largely unchanged. Resource requirements (before recosting): $3,583,100 28B.40 This component is the responsibility of the Financial Information Operations Service of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts. It will be implemented in accordance with the strategy detailed under component 5, Financial information operations, of subprogramme 2, Programme planning, budget and accounts, of programme 24, Management and Support Services, of the strategic framework for the period 2010-2011 (A/63/6/Rev.1). Table 28B.17 Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures Objective of the Organization: To improve the efficiency of financial business processes. (a) Consistency of the operational requirements strategy of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards and the Enterprise Resource Planning system (a) (i) Percentage of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts operational requirements incorporated seamlessly into the International Public Sector Accounting Standards and the Enterprise Resource Planning system 2006-2007: not available Estimate 2008-2009: to be determined Target 2010-2011: to be determined (ii) Increased percentage of information on extrabudgetary resources integrated into the financial information system (b) Adequate backup support resources for all critical Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts systems (b) Reduced percentage of service support requests that are not completed within the allocated time frame Estimate 2008-2009: zero per cent Target 2010-2011: zero per cent (c) Enhanced financial management reports (c) Increased percentage of respondents to client surveys who rate the ease of access to financial information as at least good or very good 28B.41 The Financial Information Operations Service is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that all relevant parties contribute in undertaking preparatory work to adapt accounting and finance policies and procedures to the requirements of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards and the enterprise resource planning system, that the evolution of technology and developments in related industries are in line with the related projects and that stakeholders fulfil their responsibilities and obligations and extend their full cooperation in attaining the objectives of the Service. 28B.42 During the biennium 2010-2011, the following outputs will be delivered: administrative support and finance services (regular budget and extrabudgetary): (a) Support to clients with substantive business analysis services, including reviewing and reengineering business processes based upon best practices; (b) Maintenance, updating and operation of the computerized budget information system and management of data structure, data input and system control; (c) Systems support: maintenance of charts of accounts and other finance-related reference tables in IMIS; development of ad hoc applications; support of the NOVA reporting platform; systems liaison with other Headquarters systems; administration of the tax reimbursement systems; performance of local area network administration functions; desktop support; server support; (d) Maintenance of the cash management system, including the IMIS/OPICS/SWIFT interface; maintenance of Chase Insight, OPICS and SWIFT, including upgrades to ensure that vendor support is ongoing; (e) Maintenance and support of the travel claims portal. Resource requirements: financial information operations 28B.43 Resources amounting to $3,583,100, reflecting a net increase of $174,400 would provide for the continuation of 11 posts, including 6 in the Professional and above category and 5 in the General Service category ($3,061,800), and non-post requirements ($521,300), including contractual services, general operating expenses and furniture and equipment. The increase under posts ($216,000) reflects the delayed impact of one post at the D-1 level established during the biennium 2008-2009. The net decrease in non-post resources ($41,600) relates largely to the reduced requirements under contractual services. 28B.44 This component is supported by extrabudgetary resources amounting to $8,824,700, including 17 posts (10 Professional and 7 General Service) to provide operations and application support to all of the divisions of the Office of Programme Planning Budget and Accounts; provide help desk services for support in the day-to-day functioning of IMIS finance modules; support offices away from Headquarters on IMIS finance-related matters; implement and support the Enterprise Budget Application and the troop costs and claims reimbursement system targeted for supporting the Peacekeeping Finance Division; and maintain critical systems used by the Office of Programme Planning Budget and Accounts, such as payroll, after-service health insurance, OPICS, SWIFT, Chase Insight, income tax processing and the general accounting system as well as assisting in field payroll and accounting systems. The volume of resources in comparison to the biennium 2008-2009 remains largely unchanged except for the increase anticipated under peacekeeping resources. Brief description of the recommendation Action taken to implement the recommendation Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/62/7) The Advisory Committee reiterates its view that a distinction should be made between substantive servicing of intergovernmental/expert bodies and participation in their meetings (see A/60/7, para. VIII.17). The Committee expects that in future the formulation of outputs under this budget section will be refined to reflect this distinction (para. VIII.34). Formulation of outputs reflected the citation of outputs as contained in the current programme planning budget monitoring and evaluation cycle. It should be noted, however, that in a number of cases the substantive servicing of meetings also involves participation, as these are interactive sessions. It is anticipated that the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Method of Evaluation, contained in Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2000/8, will be revised in consultation with the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the Under-Secretary-General for Management and in accordance with the decisions of the General Assembly on the Secretary-General's proposals on results-based management contained in his report on the accountability framework, enterprise risk management and internal control framework, and results-based management framework (A/62/701). The General Assembly has deferred its consideration of the aforementioned report until its resumed sixty-third session. The Advisory Committee notes that the proposed budget for the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts does not include information on follow-up action taken in response to relevant observations and recommendations made by the Committee. The Committee expects that this will be corrected in the context of the preparation of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 (para. VIII.35). Follow-up action taken in response to relevant observations and recommendations made by the Committee has been added to the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. Board of Auditors (A/63/5, vol. I, chap. II) The Board recommends that the Administration pursue its efforts to prepare for the consolidation or aggregation of the financial statements of the United Nations under IPSAS (para. 27). In progress. The matter is being considered; expert advice is being sought from an external firm and from the Office of Legal Affairs. The Administration agreed with the Board's recommendation that it expedite the automation process of contributions management in order to enable real-time management of data regarding payments made by Member States (para. 41). In progress. Online Web-based access for status of contributions (incorporating IMIS information on assessments, credits and outstanding amounts) is planned to be developed in phases during 2009. The first phase (automated cash receipt voucher generation) will be under implementation through the end of April 2009. The Administration agreed with the Board's recommendation that it design the future automated management system so as to indicate, in assessment notifications, the amount and allocation of the most recent payments received, the status of payments due and payable and the calculation used to obtain the amount of the contribution (para. 47). The first phase of an automated contributions system is currently being implemented. A separate assessment notification module is planned as part of the enhancements to the automated system and recommendations relating to the format of assessment letters will be reviewed and taken into account in the design. As to the inclusion of information on the status of payments, all assessment letters issued since 1 January 2009 uniformly include information on prior amounts due and payable as well as amounts held in overpayment. The Administration agreed with the Board's recommendation that it examine the possibility of sending universal reminder letters to Member States at the end of each quarter in order to increase the collection rate of contributions (para. 51). Following the implementation of the cash receipt voucher module of the automated contributions system, work will focus during the second quarter of 2009 on increasing access to information on the status of contributions through a dedicated reporting module. Once in place, the modalities and frequency of transmission of universal reminder letters will be assessed. The Administration agreed with the Board's recommendation that it take measures to ensure that invoices are certified in a timely manner so as to ensure payment within the usual stipulated deadline of 30 days after the receipt of goods and services (para. 54). In progress. Ongoing efforts focus on improving the percentage of invoices paid within 30 days. Focal points were designated in each department/office to facilitate the follow-up of certification of invoices. Possibilities for enhancing the capability for automated invoice tracking are also under consideration. The Board recommends that the Organization adopt a funding strategy for its end-of-service and post-retirement liabilities (para. 67). In progress. A report on funding strategy will be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. The Board recommends that the Administration reconsider the disclosure of the statement of cash flows to include the cash pools as part of the total cash balance (para. 72). The recommendation will be implemented in the context of financial statements for the biennium 2008-2009. The Board recommends that the Administration put in place, for all of its technical cooperation activities, a results-measurement mechanism comparable to that required for the projects funded by the Development Account (para. 89). The Administration put in place, for all of its technical cooperation activities, a results-measurement mechanism comparable to that required for the projects funded by the Development Account. The Board recommends that the Administration continually review its milestones for the preparation for implementation of IPSAS (para. 124). In progress. The recommendation is included in current plans for IPSAS development (see the first progress report of the Secretary-General on the adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards by the United Nations (A/62/806)). The Board recommends that, in view of the implementation of IPSAS, the Administration ensure that the Accounts Division considers capitalizing renovation work carried out on the Organization's assets (para. 195). As noted by the Board in paragraph 194 of its report, a change in the accounting policy is not realistic at this time. Moreover, partial adoption of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards standard on capitalization of property, plant and equipment for renovation works would be contrary to the United Nations system accounting standards, and full adoption would not be possible given the complexities and magnitude of the preparatory work required. The Administration has, however, already begun to set up a framework that will separately identify the costs to be capitalized and those to be charged to the capital master plan, which will facilitate the transition to the requirements of IPSAS. The Administration agreed with the Board's recommendation that it specify in the statement of ex gratia payments to which account the payments are posted (para. 369). The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts reports to the Board of Auditors on ex gratia payments at the end of the biennium, in accordance with regulation 5.11. Implementation will occur in March 2010 when the final accounts for the biennium 2008-2009 are submitted to the Board of Auditors. The Board recommends that the Administration ensure that the standard reports on cases of fraud and presumptive fraud submitted to the Board contain sufficient detail to allow for a proper analysis (para. 376). In progress. The Administration is working with the Board to ensure that the standard fraud reporting templates capture comprehensive details, as needed. (A/61/5, vol. I, chap. II) The Administration agreed with the Board's recommendation that it strengthen its controls in certifying and approving payments on travel advances pertaining to the daily subsistence allowance, and ensure that the functionality in IMIS include controls that reject two separate travel vouchers with the same payee and claim description (para. 85). The travel claim portal implementation began in May 2008 and now has over 12 departments or offices participating, with over 1,400 transactions having been processed through the portal. The remaining few departments/offices are expected to be participating before the third quarter of 2009. The Administration agreed with the Board's recommendation that the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, in coordination with the Facilities Management Services, improve the recording and maintenance of property records to ensure fair valuation of non-expendable property in the notes to financial statements (para. 117). Adjustments arising from the 2005 physical inventory count at Headquarters were reconciled, duly authorized and incorporated in the non-expendable data reported in the notes to the 2006-2007 financial statements. Adjustments arising from the 2008 physical inventory count highlighted the need for additional strengthened procedures which are being undertaken by the Facilities Management Division. The Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts continues to work with the Division in improving the reliability of non-expendable property data for disclosure in the financial statements. The Board reiterates its recommendation that the Administration expedite the closure of long inactive trust funds (para. 142). The Programme Planning and Budget Division and, as necessary, the Peacekeeping Financing Division, regularly review the list of inactive trust funds and follow up with the respective implementing offices on status and action to be taken. The Board recommends that the Administration complete all of the remaining automation initiatives, set definite timelines for their collective completion and use in production, and ensure that, in developing the attendant applications, control issues are addressed (para. 256). Phase 1 of the ICOS project as completed and is in production. The bank reconciliation portion of the original phase 2, as defined in the previous submissions, has commenced and is expected to be implemented in part by 2009 and fully implemented by December 2009. The other components of phase 2 will be implemented in the scope of the Enterprise Resource Planning implementation. The Board reiterates its recommendation that the United Nations develop suitable data-processing tools for cash management (para. 270). Since cash transactions related to investments are recorded and managed in OPICS, the data-processing tools for cash management at United Nations Headquarters need to be developed using OPICS. ICOS is such a project and it intends to encompass both investment and cashier operations (see para. 256 of the Board's report for the current status of the ICOS project). The Board recommends that Treasury, in coordination with the Accounts Division and the Contributions Service, consider reducing the number of bank accounts by making greater use of the Operations Processing Integrated Control System (para. 415). The reduction in the number of bank accounts is included as part of Treasury's indicators of achievement and criteria for such reduction have been formalized. Reduction in the number of accounts is one of the major Treasury requirements for Enterprise Resource Planning and requires Accounts Division and Contributions Service agreement. It should be noted, however, that conditions in countries which host United Nations field operations, United Nations offices away from Headquarters, programmes and funds beyond the control of Treasury could lead to an increase in the number of bank accounts needed to be established. The Board recommends that Treasury automate, to the extent possible, fund sufficiency check in the Operations Processing Integrated Control System (para. 431). The process of determining the amounts to invest/sweep is still carried out manually. The automated fund sufficiency check has been identified as one of the major requirements of the Enterprise Resource Planning. The Board recommends that Treasury automate all matching and reconciliation processes required by cash and investment management and between OPICS and IMIS (para. 441). In progress. There is a daily interface between OPICS and IMIS for investment transactions. The Board recommends that the United Nations issue revised instructions on the management of trust funds, to facilitate the creation of operating reserves (para. 800). As indicated in the Secretary-General's report on implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors contained in its reports on the United Nations for the biennium ended 31 December 2007 and on the capital master plan for the year ended 31 December 2007 (A/63/327), the trust fund reform is ongoing. It has had to be reprioritized in view of other, more critical projects, including the Enterprise Resource Planning system, IPSAS, results-based management, accountability, enterprise risk management and the harmonization of the financial regulations and rules. (A/59/5, vol. I, chap. II) The Board recommends that the United Nations review the funding mechanism for end-of-service and post-retirement benefit liabilities (para. 47). The General Assembly deferred consideration of after-service health insurance funding. Nevertheless, accrued after-service health insurance liabilities were recorded in the financial statements for the biennium 2006-2007. A further proposal on after-service health insurance funding is to be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. The Board recommends that the Administration implement the disclosure procedure for investment losses, as provided for in United Nations financial rule 104.16 (para. 214). The Financial Regulations and Rules harmonization project is ongoing and, based on the present timelines, the internal reviews and consultations are targeted to be substantially completed by the end of 2009, after which the revised Regulations and Rules would be submitted to the General Assembly for approval.
