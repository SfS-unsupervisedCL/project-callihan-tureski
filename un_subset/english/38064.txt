Vassilakis Acting Chairman Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism Note verbale dated 20 April 2006 from the Permanent Mission of Turkmenistan to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee The Permanent Mission of Turkmenistan to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Counter-Terrorism Committee and has the honour to submit additional information to the fourth report of Turkmenistan on measures taken to implement Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005). [Original: Russian] Additional information on the fourth report of Turkmenistan on measures to implement United Nations Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) This information was prepared in accordance with the comments by the Chairman of the Counter-Terrorism Committee on the fourth report of Turkmenistan, submitted pursuant to paragraph 6 of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001); measures within the framework of resolution 1624 (2005) were also taken into consideration. In accordance with the Act of Turkmenistan on combating terrorism of 15 August 2003, the law enforcement agencies of Turkmenistan combat terrorism within the limits of their authority, mainly in the area of detecting and preventing potential manifestations of terrorism and suppressing illicit links between nationals of Turkmenistan and members of international terrorist organizations. A proponent of a policy of peace and good-neighbourliness -- a policy which is especially crucial against the backdrop of a complex situation in which there are outbreaks of armed conflict at various points throughout the world posing a serious threat to all of humanity -- Turkmenistan affirms, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), its unequivocal condemnation of terrorist acts in all their manifestations and is fully committed to the efforts of the international community to combat manifestations of this evil. 2005 marked a historic event for Turkmenistan. As it endeavoured to improve international cooperation in combating crime, Turkmenistan became a full member of the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). Turkmenistan's membership in such a representative organization through inclusion in the Interpol global communications system I-24/7 will have a positive impact on international police cooperation and improve international cooperation in combating terrorism. Confronted by the large-scale international terrorist and extremist offensive, the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) perceived this threat as a global problem which can be tackled only through joint efforts. Such efforts included the international workshop for CIS member States held in Moscow from 28 to 30 December 2005 on enacting the universal counter-terrorism instruments and regional experience in promoting international cooperation against terrorism, organized by the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate and the CIS Anti-Terrorist Centre, in which representatives of Turkmenistan also took part. The workshop was a forum for CIS member States for the purpose of: considering progress made in the area of ratifying and legally implementing the 12 universal conventions and protocols on combating international terrorism as well as Security Council resolution 1373 (2001), conducting a focused survey of the general amendments to legislative acts which were taken or will be necessary for the practical implementation of these instruments, exchanging experience in enhancing international cooperation in combating terrorism, and determining future measures at the national and regional level. Emphasizing the leading role of the United Nations in combating terrorism and supporting the existing universal legal instruments to combat terrorism and viewing them as the basis for international cooperation to counter international terrorism, Turkmenistan has acceded to all 12 universal counter-terrorism conventions and the protocols thereto. Given that terrorist activity is generally of an international nature, Turkmenistan is taking every necessary measure to strengthen monitoring of the entry of foreign nationals and stateless persons into the territory of Turkmenistan and their stay in and exit from the country, including the adoption on 7 December 2005 of the Act of Turkmenistan on migration, which establishes in accordance with the generally recognized standards of international law, the procedures for entry into, stay in and exit from Turkmenistan by Turkmen nationals, foreign nationals and stateless persons and which also determines the legal relations in the area of migration processes in Turkmenistan and the authority of the government agencies of Turkmenistan to regulate migration processes in Turkmenistan. This law regulates the obtaining of residence permits by foreign nationals and stateless persons temporarily staying in Turkmenistan and applicants for residence permits in Turkmenistan and the revocation of such permits. In accordance with article 15, paragraph 10, of the Act on grounds for denying a visa and residence permit in Turkmenistan, a foreign national or stateless person may be denied a visa or residence permit in Turkmenistan on the grounds that that person is a member of a terrorist, anti-government, extremist or other criminal organization or is associated with such an organization. These circumstances also serve as the basis for revoking the residence permit in Turkmenistan of a foreign national or stateless person (in accordance with article 16, paragraph 4, of this Act). The decree of the President of Turkmenistan of 13 July 2005 on the improvement of the activities of the State Service for the Registration of Foreign Nationals approved the regulations on the work procedures of the Commission for Monitoring the Issuance of Visas and regulations on the procedures for inviting foreign nationals to work temporarily in Turkmenistan. The decree of the President of Turkmenistan of 24 October 2005 on the introduction of a new passports for citizens of Turkmenistan to exit from and enter into Turkmenistan also approved the design of passports for citizens with biometric data (photo identification and fingerprints) as well as the regulations on the procedures for processing the passports of citizens of Turkmenistan for exit from and entry into the country. For the purpose of preventing terrorism-related crime, Turkmenistan is conducting, within its spheres of action, ongoing operational and preventive work intended to detect persons prone to terrorist activity and those associated with them. In accordance with article 7 of the Act of Turkmenistan on combating terrorism, the State Counter-Terrorism Commission, established by the President of Turkmenistan, is responsible for coordinating the activities of and ensuring cooperation among government bodies engaged in combating terrorism and public associations for the purpose of harmonizing their actions to prevent, detect and suppress terrorist acts and also to identify and remedy the causes and conditions that contribute to the preparation and carrying out of terrorist acts. The decree of the President of Turkmenistan of 7 March 2005 approved the regulations on the procedures for granting refugee status in Turkmenistan, which established the procedures for granting refugee status on the basis of the generally recognized principles and standards of international law and in accordance with the Act of Turkmenistan of 12 June 1997 on refugees. The agencies of the State Service of Turkmenistan for the Registration of Foreign Nationals have the right, upon request by the competent authorities when they identify circumstances covered under the law of Turkmenistan which constitute grounds for the loss or revocation of a person's refugee status, to decide on the loss or revocation of refugee status in Turkmenistan. In accordance with article 7 of the Act of Turkmenistan on refugees, refugee status is not granted to a person where there are serious grounds to believe that he or she: - Has committed a crime against peace, a military crime or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drafted for the purpose of taking measures in respect of such crimes; - Has committed a serious crime of a non-political nature outside Turkmenistan before being allowed into Turkmenistan as a refugee; - Is guilty of committing acts that run counter to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

On 10 April 2003, Turkmenistan and the Russian Federation signed the Agreement on cooperation in the area of security, which provides for cooperation between the countries for the purpose of strengthening peace and enhancing stability and security in Central Asia and the world in general. With respect to combating terrorism, the Agreement specifies as follows: "The parties shall cooperate in combating international terrorism, suppress the activities of terrorist and extremist organizations, prevent and suppress acts of terrorism, their preparation and financing, deny asylum to identified members of terrorist organizations, exchange tactical information about their plans, cooperate in the area of providing legal assistance and the extradition of persons who have committed or prepared to commit terrorist activities in the territory of one of the Parties, using for these purposes the mechanisms for bilateral and multilateral cooperation by the competent departments within the framework of the relevant international organizations."
