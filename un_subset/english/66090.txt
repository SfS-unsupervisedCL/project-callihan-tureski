Sixty-seventh session Agenda item 75 (a) Oceans and the law of the sea Letter dated 20 February 2013 from the Permanent Representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to transmit to you the note verbale dated 24 December 2012 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Embassy of the State of Kuwait in Tehran, responding to certain claims with regard to the activities of Iranian vessels in the Persian Gulf (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 75 (a). (Signed) Mohammad Khazaee Ambassador Permanent Representative Note verbale The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran presents its compliments to the Embassy of the State of Kuwait in Tehran and, with reference to note verbale No. 20121237 dated 23 September 2012 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State of Kuwait addressed to the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Kuwait, has the honour to state the following: On the basis of the inquiry made by the relevant authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is confirmed that there has been no violation by Iranian military vessels and therefore the claims raised in the above-mentioned note verbale are categorically rejected. It is worth mentioning that all activities and patrolling of military vessels of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman are conducted within the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran and in accordance with international law of the sea. It should be recalled that raising baseless and provocative claims and using inappropriate and unjustifiable concepts and terms that contain specific meaning under international law are against the principle of goodwill, undermine bilateral and multilateral efforts of the regional States to strengthen stability and security in the region and do not contribute to mutual understanding and trust. Moreover, and as has been previously declared, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran does not recognize any claim of sovereign rights to the resources of the seabed and its subsoil in the divided zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia (former neutral zone) until and unless its maritime border in this area is delimited. The sovereign rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in this area shall be determined on the basis of principles of goodwill, good neighbourliness and international law. Finally, while recalling the established principle under international law that a bilateral treaty does not create obligations for a third state (pacta tertiis nec nocent nec prosunt), and reiterating the objection already made by the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2009 to the bilateral agreement between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Iran stands ready to conduct bilateral negotiations with Kuwait with a view to delimiting the maritime borders of the two States in the relevant part of the divided zone. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Embassy of the State of Kuwait in Tehran the assurances of its highest consideration.
