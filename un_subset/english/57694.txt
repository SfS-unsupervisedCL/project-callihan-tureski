The budget provides for the deployment of 135 military observers, 4,065 military contingent personnel, 50 United Nations police officers, 97 international staff, 60 national staff and 20 United Nations Volunteers. The total resource requirements for UNISFA for the financial period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 have been linked to the mission's objective through a number of results-based-budgeting frameworks, organized according to components (security and governance in the Abyei Area, and support). The human resources of the mission, in terms of the number of personnel, have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the mission as a whole. The explanations of variances in resource levels, both human resources and financial resources, have been linked, where applicable, to specific outputs planned by the mission.

The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in section IV of the present report. A. Overall 1. By its resolution 1990 (2011), the Security Council established the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) and decided that UNISFA would comprise a maximum of 4,200 military personnel, 50 police personnel and appropriate civilian support. 2. The mission is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, support for the implementation of the 20 June 2011 Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement on Temporary Arrangements for the Administration and Security of the Abyei Area, to allow for returns, ensure the protection of civilians and support the peaceful administration of the Abyei Area. 3. Within this overall objective, UNISFA will, during the budgetary period, contribute to a number of expected accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below. These frameworks are organized according to two components, namely, security and governance in the Abyei Area, and support, which are derived from the mandate of the mission. 4. The expected accomplishments would lead to the fulfilment of the Security Council's objective within the lifetime of the mission, and the indicators of achievement show a measurement of progress towards such accomplishments during the budgetary period. The human resources of UNISFA, in terms of the number of personnel, have been attributed to the individual components, with the exception of the mission's executive direction and management, which can be attributed to the mission as a whole. Explanations on the number of personnel have been provided under the respective components. 5. UNISFA will be headed by the Head of Mission, who also serves as Force Commander at the Assistant Secretary-General level. The mission will have an area-based and decentralized organizational structure comprising a mission headquarters in Abyei town and 10 company operating bases in the Abyei Area. The Deputy Force Commander, the Chief of Mission Support, the Principal Adviser, the Force Chief of Staff, the Senior Police Adviser, the Chief Security Adviser and the two liaison offices in Juba and Khartoum, led by two Senior Military Officers, will report directly to the Head of Mission. 6. The mission will establish a Force headquarters in Abyei town and three infantry battalions supported by two tank companies, two artillery batteries and associated enabling units, including an aviation unit, a multirole logistics unit, a level II medical facility, an engineering company with well-drilling capacity, a quick-reaction force and a demining platoon. Mine action capacity will be provided by a military demining platoon, supplemented by an operational coordination component and route verification, survey and clearance teams provided by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), with the assistance of the United Nations Mine Action Service. 7. The headquarters will serve as the principal interface with the joint bodies outlined in the Agreement of 20 June 2011, namely, the Abyei Area Administration, the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee and the Abyei Police Service. The 11 company operating bases (consisting of three operating bases transferred from the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS) and eight new sites to be constructed) will be of sufficient size for the conduct of at least two independent patrols concurrently and will be located in Abyei town, Agok, Athony, Diffra, Dumboloya, Goli, Noong, Soheib, Tajalei, Um Khaer and Um Khariet. The bases will be established on the basis of military monitoring and verification requirements. Temporary operating bases and permanent and non-permanent checkpoints may also be established in response to emerging threats. 8. The police component will be composed of personnel from multiple police-contributing countries, organized into three units. One unit will assist with the vetting, selection and recruitment of the Abyei Police Service, the second will focus on training and development, and the third (and largest) will provide operational support. The operational component will be based in Abyei, Agok and other locations occupied by the Abyei Police Service. 9. The substantive civilian staff of UNISFA will be limited to those performing functions essential to the mandate, including providing support to the Force Commander and maintaining liaison with the Abyei Area Administration, the parties to the 20 June Agreement, local communities and humanitarian actors, as well as managerial and organizational functions, including planning and reporting. There will also be a civilian security presence, comprising 16 international and national staff deployed across the 11 locations. 10. The General Assembly, in its resolution 65/257 B, appropriated and assessed an amount of $482,460,550 for the maintenance of UNMIS for the six-month period from 1 July to 31 December 2011. The Assembly also authorized the Secretary-General to draw upon the resources approved for UNMIS in entering into commitments for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2011 for UNISFA and any other missions established by the Security Council before 31 December 2011 in support of the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. In addition, the Assembly noted the intention of the Council, as stated in its resolution 1978 (2011), to establish a successor mission to UNMIS, and authorized the Secretary-General to draw upon the resources approved for UNMIS in entering into commitments for a successor mission for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2011. 11. The Security Council, in its resolutions 1990 (2011) and 1996 (2011), decided to establish UNISFA and the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), respectively. Accordingly, pursuant to authorization granted by the General Assembly in resolution 65/257 B on the financing of UNMIS, commitment authorities were provided for the deployment of UNMISS and UNISFA in the amount of $277,915,150 and $93,452,600, respectively, with the balance of appropriation, in the amount of $111,092,800, utilized for the withdrawal of UNMIS. Of the amount of $482,460,550 that the Assembly assessed upon Member States in resolution 65/257 B, the amount of $137,532,000 is to be applied to the Special Account for UNMIS, the amount of $277,915,150 is to be applied to the Special Account for UNMISS, and the balance, in the amount of $67,013,400, is to be applied to the Special Account for UNISFA. B. Planning assumptions and mission support initiatives 12. With the end of the interim period under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the status of Abyei, an oil-rich area on the border between the Sudan and South Sudan, remains unresolved. A build-up of Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) forces beginning in early 2011 culminated in a major SAF offensive as from 20 May 2011, a population exodus to Agok and across the border into South Sudan, and widespread looting and damage. 13. On 20 June 2011, with the assistance of the African Union High-level Implementation Panel, the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) signed the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement on Temporary Arrangements for the Administration and Security of the Abyei Area. The Agreement provides for the total withdrawal of armed forces, the full demilitarization of the Abyei Area and the deployment of an interim security force of up to 4,200 troops following Security Council authorization. It also provides for the establishment of an Abyei Area Administration, to be jointly administered by an SPLM-nominated Chief Administrator and a Deputy nominated by the Government of the Sudan, an Abyei Joint Oversight Committee with the power to supervise and promote security and stability, and an Abyei Police Service. 14. Resolution 1990 (2011) gives UNISFA a mandate, including to monitor and verify the redeployment of armed forces from the Abyei Area in accordance with the 20 June Agreement; to participate in relevant Abyei Area bodies as stipulated in the Agreement; to provide demining assistance and technical advice; to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel, in coordination with relevant Abyei Area bodies; to strengthen the capacity of the Abyei Police Service by providing support, including the training of personnel, and coordinate with the Service on matters of law and order; and, when necessary and in cooperation with the Service, to provide security for oil infrastructure in the Abyei Area. The Security Council also gave UNISFA authorization under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment; to ensure the security and freedom of movement of United Nations and humanitarian personnel and members of the Joint Military Observers Committee and joint military observer teams established under the 20 June Agreement; to protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence; and to protect the Area from incursions by unauthorized elements and ensure security. 15. The military contingent of 4,200 personnel will include 116 staff officers and 135 military observers. All military personnel, except for a number of staff officers and military observers, will be contributed by Ethiopia. The police component will be composed of personnel from various police-contributing countries. 16. The initial deployment of the force was completed by August 2011. The deployment of the police personnel will coincide with the establishment of the Abyei Police Service, with the exception of a small number deployed as part of an advance team for planning purposes. 17. In the initial phase of its operations, UNISFA will have the following primary goals: (a) establishing a robust presence to enhance security; (b) monitoring and verifying the redeployment of SAF and SPLA, or its successor, from the Abyei Area; (c) establishing relationships with the relevant Abyei Area bodies; (d) strengthening the capacity of the nascent Abyei Police Service; and (e) addressing the threat posed by mines and unexploded ordnance. Those activities are expected to contribute to an environment conducive to the voluntary return of the 113,000 displaced persons, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel. Furthermore, the stabilization of Abyei will build confidence between the parties to the 20 June Agreement, helping to create an environment conducive to political negotiations on the final status of Abyei and other outstanding issues. 18. It is assumed that the parties are willing to implement the 20 June Agreement and that UNISFA will have the required operating environment to support the implementation of its mandate. The successful implementation of the mandate will also depend on force deployment, the dispatch of civilian support staff, the processing by the Government of the Sudan of visas and clearances, and rapid progress in the construction of facilities that meet United Nations safety standards. 19. It can also be assumed that the security situation will remain fragile in the context of the upcoming migration season, the ongoing disputes over land use and ownership between the Ngok Dinka and Misseriya communities, and the widespread presence of arms. The new Abyei Police Service is likely to take some time to reach operational capacity and will be dependent on the establishment of the Abyei Area Administration, as stipulated in the 20 June Agreement. Discord over the nomination of the Chief Administrator has slowed the implementation of the Agreement, despite the swift deployment of United Nations troops to Abyei. The widespread looting and damage that occurred in the context of the fighting of May 2011 will have an impact on security and returns and will require extensive communal reconciliation, especially since formal mechanisms for compensation are not in place. Contamination from landmines and explosive remnants of war is also expected, given recent hostilities and past limitations on demining activity, and will both pose a threat to civilians and humanitarian actors and place a constraint on UNISFA operations. Large-scale returns are unlikely until the armed forces withdraw, a functional administration is established and the threat posed by landmines is addressed. 20. Discussions on the final status of Abyei will continue to have inflammatory potential inside the Area and between the Sudan and South Sudan. The 20 June Agreement commits the parties to the consideration of African Union High-level Implementation Panel proposals towards the peaceful resolution of the final status of Abyei, but those negotiations will be complex and linked to a wide range of issues that remain to be addressed between the two Governments. Although UNISFA will work closely with the parties, the Abyei Area Administration and the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee, and will coordinate with the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Sudan and South Sudan and with the Panel, the mission does not have a mandate with respect to the political process. 21. With respect to military personnel, the timeline for the deployment of the military contingent and the police component has included a 15 per cent delayed deployment factor in addition to phased deployment. As regards civilian staff, the present report reflects the proposed establishment of a total of 177 posts, comprising 97 international staff, 60 national staff and 20 United Nations Volunteers. In estimating resource requirements for civilian staffing, vacancy rates of 20 per cent for international staff, 15 per cent for national staff and 20 per cent for United Nations Volunteers have been used, in addition to phased deployment. 22. The mission will be deployed in a footprint consisting of 15 locations, including 4 taken over from UNMIS; UNISFA support staff located in Entebbe; liaison offices in Khartoum and Juba; and 8 locations to be constructed. Given the urgency of the requirement, it is expected that construction will begin on three sites within the financial year 2011/12, whereas the resources for the construction of camps in the remaining five locations will be requested in the budget proposal for 2012/13. It is expected that United Nations police personnel, international civilian staff and United Nations Volunteers will be collocated with the military contingent. 23. Contingent-owned equipment will be deployed overland from Addis Ababa to Abyei to mission locations, with contingents initially deployed to Kadugli by air, before being deployed overland and by air assets into the mission area. 24. Key assets for the mission will be transferred from UNMIS. Thus, there will be minimal acquisitions of vehicles and communications and information technology, medical and other equipment. 25. Aviation support for UNISFA will leverage mission contingent-owned equipment, United Nations contracted assets and shared regional aviation assets. Aviation assets will be used for the full range of tasks, including casualty evacuation, command and liaison, military patrol insertion and extraction, observation, resupply and movement. It is anticipated that aviation assets will include one Dash fixed-wing aircraft; one Mi-26 heavy-lift helicopter, shared among UNMISS, UNAMID and UNISFA; and two utility helicopters and two tactical helicopters located in Abyei. 26. No significant infrastructure support for the Government authorities (for example, state/county offices, police stations, prisons, equipment) is expected to be provided by the mission, and no dedicated resources are proposed. C. Regional mission cooperation 27. While the mandate and activities of UNISFA will be distinct from those of UNMISS, the mission will draw significantly on existing logistical arrangements and support structures in UNMISS, which will significantly reduce its initial presence on the ground. D. Partnerships and country team coordination 28. Given the small size of the UNISFA civilian component, strong civil-military coordination will be essential to support the delivery of humanitarian aid, ensure the safety and freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel, and capitalize on synergies between the roles of the military and police components with regard to the physical protection of civilians and the programmatic roles of United Nations funds, programmes and agencies that are operational in Abyei. UNISFA will coordinate its activities with United Nations funds, programmes and agencies present in Abyei, as well as with national and international non-governmental organizations and bilateral donors, through a civilian-military coordination structure, supported by humanitarian actors in Abyei town. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will be the primary interface for UNISFA on these issues. 29. The Security Council, in resolution 1990 (2011), requested the Secretary-General to ensure that effective human rights monitoring was carried out and the results included in his reports to the Security Council. This function will be performed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. UNISFA will coordinate with the human rights presence on issues relevant to its mandate, including the protection of civilians, and will provide logistical support to human rights personnel. 30. The humanitarian community continues to negotiate with the authorities of the Sudan and South Sudan to ensure that assistance is provided to the extent possible to people in need in the Area. Currently, as most of the persons displaced from the conflict in Abyei are located in South Sudan, they continue to receive assistance there, and it is unlikely that they will return home before the end of the rainy season, and in any case not before the full withdrawal of SAF from Abyei and the demining of the Area. E. Results-based-budgeting frameworks Executive direction and management 31. Overall mission direction and management are to be provided by the Office of the Head of Mission/Force Commander. Table 1 Human resources: executive direction and management National staffa Total USG- ASG D-2- D-1 P-5- P-4 P-3- P-1 Field Service Subtotal Office of the Force Commander Office of the Deputy Force Commander Liaison Office Office of the Force Chief of Staff Office of the Principal Officer Total proposed a Includes national General Service staff. 32. The Head of Mission, at the Assistant Secretary-General level, is responsible for the implementation of the UNISFA mandate and the overall management of the mission, and will serve as Area Security Coordinator in the mission. The Head of Mission will also serve as Force Commander and will therefore be responsible for the operations of the military contingent, including the provision of security; the protection of United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment and civilians under imminent threat of violence; the facilitation of the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel; the protection of the Area from incursions; and the provision of security for oil infrastructure. He will be supported by a Special Assistant (P-4), a Personal Assistant (Field Service) and an Administrative Assistant (national General Service). 33. The Deputy Force Commander (D-2) will support the Head of Mission and will serve as Officer-in-Charge when the Head of Mission is outside the mission area. The Deputy Force Commander will be supported by an Administrative Assistant (Field Service). 34. In order to provide continuous liaison with the Governments of the Sudan and South Sudan, liaison offices will be established in Khartoum and Juba. Each liaison office will be headed by a Senior Military Officer from the military component, and will be supported by a P-4 Liaison Officer and a national General Service staff member. The Liaison Officer will consult with the Governments of the Sudan and South Sudan on the deployment and operations of the mission, including the status-of-forces agreement, clearances, visas and other administrative matters. The incumbent will also serve as the civilian representative of the mission, for the purpose of information-sharing and the organization of high-level visits to the mission area. 35. The Force Chief of Staff (D-1) will direct, supervise and coordinate the work of nine military sections in the Force headquarters on day-to-day multidimensional operations, reporting directly to the Force Commander. The incumbent will also be responsible for the development and issuance of standard operating procedures, orders, plans, directives and policies in the Force headquarters. She or he will coordinate briefings in the Force headquarters and update the Force Commander on the progress of military operations. In addition, the incumbent will be responsible for the coordination of all matters concerning strategic planning, operations, personnel management, information management and civil-military cooperation, as well as other cross-cutting issues affecting UNISFA and other United Nations and non-governmental agencies. 36. The Principal Officer (D-1) will function as the primary adviser to the Head of Mission on strategic matters relevant to the implementation of the mandate and relations with external actors. She or he will conduct consultations on behalf of the Head of Mission with the Government of the Sudan, the Government of South Sudan, the Abyei Area Administration and the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee, towards the implementation of the 20 June Agreement. He or She will be supported by a Programme Officer (P-3). The Office of the Principal Officer will comprise a Coordination Officer (P-4) to conduct overall mission-wide coordination, including the coordination and development of mission planning, results-based-budgeting frameworks, staffing, legal affairs and conduct and discipline issues; a Reporting Officer (P-4) to fulfil Security Council-mandated reporting requirements, manage day-to-day information with sectoral offices and United Nations Headquarters, and monitor the media and developments in the humanitarian situation; a Reporting Officer (P-3) to monitor the media and developments in the humanitarian situation and provide substantive feedback on a daily basis regarding developments in the Abyei Area; a Protocol Assistant (Field Service) to provide support in all protocol-related matters, including high-level visits and relations with the Abyei Area Administration; and two Administrative Assistants (1 Field Service and 1 national General Service). Component 1: security and governance in the Abyei Area 37. Following the withdrawal of SAF, SPLA and other armed forces, UNISFA will provide the sole military presence in Abyei. In order to monitor demilitarization, deter threats, maintain situational awareness, build confidence and help create conditions conducive to the safety and security of humanitarian operations, UNISFA will conduct mobile and static operations, carry out day and night patrols and provide escorts upon request. When necessary, the mission will provide security for oil infrastructure, in cooperation with the Abyei Police Service. During the dry season, the mission will devote additional resources to key areas to ensure secure seasonal migration. To support the implementation of the security aspects of the 20 June Agreement, it will facilitate the work of the Joint Military Observers Committee and the joint military observer teams, with the Force Commander chairing the Committee. 38. To support the provision of security, the delivery of humanitarian aid, freedom of movement and the protection of civilians under imminent threat, the United Nations Mine Action Service, together with UNOPS and in collaboration with UNISFA, will undertake emergency humanitarian mine action operations. Reducing the risk of death and injury from landmines and explosive remnants of war will have the additional benefit of encouraging voluntary returns. During the first six months, mine action operations will focus on the survey of hazardous areas, the clearance and destruction of landmines and explosive remnants of war, risk education for United Nations staff, data management and coordination and quality assurance. 39. In support of the Force's mandate to strengthen the capacity of the Abyei Police Service, the police component will assist in the design of the Service, in coordination with the Abyei Joint Oversight Committee; develop criteria for vetting, selection and recruitment; provide training and mentoring; and mobilize donor support. To contribute to the enhancement of the local community's confidence with regard to the security situation, it will also assist in the development of operational plans and procedures to address migration, nomad-related issues, livestock theft, oil infrastructure protection and gender issues, and will provide guidance and assistance in implementing a community policing strategy to improve public and police relations. The component will also coordinate with the Service to support complementary improvements in the corrections system, to ensure that increases in the police presence do not lead to an overstretching of the capacity of local prisons.

Training will be provided to international and national staff as well as UNISFA military and police personnel in order to upgrade various substantive and technical skills in such areas as communications, information technology and human resources management. G. Mine detection and mine-clearing services 80. The estimated resource requirements for mine detection and mine-clearing services for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 are as follows: Mine detection and mine-clearing equipment Mine detection and mine-clearing supplies 81. Landmines were an integral part of the civil war in the Sudan during the period 1983-2005, with all parties using significant quantities of them to disrupt enemy operations. The types of these mines ranged from old to modern; they were manufactured by a number of countries and were often used in small quantities in operationally important areas or routes, rather than in formal tactical minefields. 82. During the conflict, records were rarely kept; those that have been recovered are often inaccurate. Insecurity in Abyei during the period of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement severely limited mine action survey, clearance and risk education. As a result, information on the scope of contamination is extremely limited. Since May 2011, the United Nations has received reports of the laying of new mines in Abyei. A mine accident on 2 August 2011 led to the deaths of four UNISFA peacekeepers and the injury of an additional seven. The identification of new hazardous areas has severely restricted freedom of movement and endangered the safe return of internally displaced persons. The United Nations Mine Action Service will plan, coordinate and facilitate the implementation of, and provide quality assurance for, mine action operations to reduce the risk of death and injury from landmines and explosive remnants of war. Focus areas will include the clearance and destruction of landmines and explosive remnants of war, the survey of hazardous areas, risk education for United Nations staff, data management, and the coordination and quality assurance of all humanitarian mine clearance. 83. The proposed resource requirements of $6,731,900 for mine detection and mine-clearing services include funding for international and national staff ($1,387,000); contracts for route assessment and clearance capacity, and mine action support teams for technical survey capacity, explosive-ordnance disposal and targeted demining ($4,105,400); official travel ($90,700); equipment ($264,100); and operational expenses ($386,000). The balance represents UNOPS support and management fees, amounting to $178,100 and $320,600, respectively. H. Quick-impact projects 84. The estimated resource requirements for quick-impact projects for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 are as follows: Period Amount Number of projects 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (proposed) 85. The mission will be in a start-up mode during the first budgetary cycle, a period when personnel are being deployed, thereby limiting the ability of the mission to identify, manage and implement projects. A provision of $150,000 is proposed for the implementation of six projects, in the areas of humanitarian assistance (3 projects) and reconciliation, outreach and conflict resolution (3 projects). The implementation of quick-impact projects across the Abyei Area will create a positive environment for the start-up of the mission and will make a more effective contribution during in the critical phase of peace consolidation upon the return of internally displaced persons and during the migration season. The quick-impact projects will not only focus on building confidence between the communities in the Abyei Area, but will also result in improved mutual understanding between the local population and UNISFA, through infrastructure-rebuilding projects for schools and health centres, the repair of water pumps, the provision of equipment, and the conduct of training and sensitization activities. It is expected that the mission will have greater capacity to manage quick-impact projects in the 2012/13 budgetary period. III. Analysis of resource requirements 86.

Cost estimate :: Mandate: establishment of the mission 87. The proposed requirements reflect resources for the phased deployment of 135 military observers, with a delayed deployment rate of 15 per cent. The estimate reflects mainly requirements for the payment of mission subsistence allowance, for which the daily rates of $188 for the first 30 days and $136 thereafter have been adjusted to lower rates of $159 and $115, respectively, because accommodation is provided by UNISFA ($2,944,100); and travel on emplacement, which is based on commercial rates ($301,100). 88. The cost estimate includes the cost of the phased deployment of 4,065 troops and staff officers, with a delayed deployment factor of 15 per cent, comprising mainly the reimbursement of troop costs to troop-contributing countries ($32,442,800); contingent-owned equipment costs based on applicable rates ($16,888,800); the cost of rations ($10,547,100); and the freight and deployment costs of contingent-owned equipment ($10,097,500). 89. The provision provides for the phased deployment of 50 civilian police officers, with a delayed deployment rate of 15 per cent. It includes mainly mission subsistence allowance, for which the prevailing daily rates of $188 (first 30 days) and $136 (after 30 days) have been adjusted to lower rates of $159 and $115, respectively, because accommodation is provided by UNISFA ($1,398,400); and travel on emplacement, based on commercial rates ($111,500). 90. The cost estimate is based on the phased deployment of 97 international staff, with a delayed deployment factor of 20 per cent.

A. Terminology related to proposed changes in human resources The following terminology has been applied with respect to proposed changes in human resources (see sect. I of the present report): :: Post establishment: a new post is proposed to be established when additional resources are necessary and when it is not possible to redeploy resources from other offices or otherwise accommodate specific activities from within existing resources :: Post reassignment: an approved post that was intended to cover a certain function is proposed to implement other priority mandated activities unrelated to the original function. While a post reassignment may involve a change of location or office, it does not change the category or level of the post :: Post redeployment: an approved post is proposed to be redeployed to cover comparable or related functions in another office :: Post reclassification: an approved post is proposed to be reclassified (upgraded or downgraded) when the duties and responsibilities of the post have changed substantially :: Post abolishment: an approved post is proposed to be abolished if it is no longer needed to implement the activities for which it was approved or to implement other priority mandated activities within the mission :: Post conversion: three possible options for post conversion are as follows: ° Conversion of general temporary assistance positions to posts: approved positions financed under general temporary assistance are proposed for conversion to posts if the functions being performed are of a continuing nature ° Conversion of individual contractors or individuals on procurement contracts to national staff posts: taking into account the continuing nature of certain functions, in line with section VIII, paragraph 11, of General Assembly resolution 59/296, individual contractors or individuals on procurement contracts are proposed for conversion to national staff posts ° Conversion of international staff posts to national staff posts: approved international staff posts are proposed for conversion to national staff posts B. Terminology related to variance analysis Section III of the present report indicates the single largest contributing factor of each resource variance according to specific standard options encompassed in the four standard categories listed below: :: Mandate: variances caused by changes in the scale or scope of the mandate, or changes in the expected accomplishments as driven by the mandate :: External: variances caused by parties or situations external to the United Nations :: Cost parameters: variances caused by United Nations regulations, rules and policies :: Management: variances caused by management actions to achieve planned results more effectively (e.g., by reprioritizing or adding certain outputs) or efficiently (e.g., by taking measures to reduce personnel or operational inputs while maintaining the same level of outputs) and/or from performance-related issues (e.g., by having underestimated the costs or quantities of inputs required to produce a certain level of outputs, or by delayed recruitment) Annex II A.
