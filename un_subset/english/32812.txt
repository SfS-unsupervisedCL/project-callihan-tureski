Association culturelle d'aide Ã  la promotion educative et sociale 2. Elizabeth Seton Federation 3. European Law Students' Association 4. Family Care International Special consultative status granted in 2001 Introduction: The Association culturelle d'aide a la promotion educative et sociale (ACAPES) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) established in 1972, officially recognized under receipt No. 3551 Mint-Dagat-Ninea: 0110916 in 1979. The emergence of a majority marginalized underprivileged class created a social dynamic which led to the establishment of the association. One of the key reasons for its success has been the transformation of frustration among young pupils and students who were excluded from the school and university systems into a desire to demonstrate the perverse effects of a stereotyped society that had already accepted an excessively selective system and nurtured alienation instead of freedom and the formation of citizens aware of their future. ACAPES has the status of a social movement, and is associated with the Government of Senegal by virtue of a protocol of agreement signed on 25 June 1985. VISION AND MISSION In accordance with its vision the advent of a world of the future in which social relations are based on solidarity and determination to combat all forms of exclusion, increasing poverty and various forms of cultural aggression, ACAPES has undertaken the mission of contributing to sustainable human development through promotion of comprehensive and holistic education in citizenship, encouragement of renewed solidarity and creation of an autonomous and credible social movement. In fulfilling its mission, ACAPES has set objectives for strategic change and strives to: 1. Promote alternative education focused on the optimal use of resources to meet growing needs; 2. Ensure the right to community life through education, risk prevention and mitigation of harm in the areas of health, hygiene and the environment; 3. Contribute to the emergence of a new cultural dynamic based on the promotion of diversity through convergences; 4. Encourage the emergence of a new form of citizenship based on internalization of the principles of democratization, promotion of rights, and conflict prevention and management; 5. Strengthen the autonomy and credibility of the social movement through confirmation of the options of professionalism and good governance with a view to promoting the emergence of leaders committed to confronting challenges. Within this framework, the strategies developed and the programmes implemented focus on two major challenges: combating poverty in the context of globalization and promoting social change within a sustainable development perspective. Strategic intervention is based on: :: Promotion of comprehensive education with a view to enabling everybody, and in particular children, young people and women, to be integrated, and participate, in social, economic and cultural life; :: Promotion of a culture of citizenship through the development of coordination, resistance and proposal mechanisms, to meet the challenges of democratization and globalization. The projects and programmes developed throughout the national territory (both urban and rural areas) and in some other African countries (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, the Niger and Togo) target the fields of alternative education and training; health, the environment, democracy, human rights and the culture of peace, an economy based on trade and solidarity, culture, and information and communication technologies. The strategic approach of ACAPES brings together in a coherent dynamic educational, training, social, cultural and economic activities for people from underprivileged backgrounds, in particular children, young people and women. It encompasses a process of recovery, integration and re-socialization of underprivileged children and young people who are excluded from the formal school system, through mediation and reconciliation with their families and neighbourhoods and rehabilitation through the implementation of a school, neighbourhood village strategy, in which the student/facilitator and trainer/mediator are the main actors who motivate and support the self-promotion initiatives of population groups (children, young people, adults) gathered together in various basic associative structures (BAS) through motivational educational, training, organizational and structuring activities.

FCI is based in New York and has field offices in five countries in Africa (Burkina Faso, Kenya, Mali, Niger and United Republic of Tanzania), and three countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador). There are also program activities in Haiti, Mexico and Panama. FCI works at the global, regional, and country levels to: strengthen national and international commitment to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD PoA); build the capacity of local partners to design, implement, and evaluate national strategies and model programs; and develop information and training materials to improve the quality of reproductive and sexual health programs and services. Part II: FCI's Participation in the Economic and Social Council and Other UN Meetings UN General Assembly Special Session on Children (UNGASS on Children), May 2002: During the UNGASS on Children, FCI was involved in a broad array of activities designed to highlight the importance of young people's access to sexual and reproductive health information, education and services.

During the 37th Session of the CPD (March and May, 2004), FCI advocated for the adoption of a resolution reaffirming the ICPD PoA and its Key Actions. High-level Technical Consultation on HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health: In collaboration with UNFPA and UNAIDS, FCI organized a technical roundtable (May 2004) and a high-level consultation (June 2004) on HIV/AIDS and reproductive health. These events aimed to highlight the linkages between HIV/AIDS and sexual and reproductive health and urge appropriate and balanced investment in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care. Participants at the high-level meeting developed the New York Call to Commitment: Linking HIV/AIDS and Sexual and Reproductive Health, which is being distributed widely at UN meetings and other international forums. Collaboration with UN Agencies: FCI works in close collaboration with a number of UN Agencies at the international, regional, and national levels. From 1987-January 2004, FCI was the secretariat of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Safe Motherhood, which included UNFPA, UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO). FCI collaborated with UNFPA on many projects from 2001-2004, including: the adaptation of our health education manual, You, Your Life, Your Dreams and the development of a peer-education program for youth in the English-speaking Caribbean; the adaptation of You, Your Life, Your Dreams for youth in Latin America; a project with youth-serving groups and public sector partners in the Dominican Republic, Panama, and Haiti to train peer educators and youth groups in communications skills, program planning, monitoring, and management; a project to create teams of youth advocates in the Dominican Republic; training in youth-friendly services for government health care workers in the Dominican Republic; a project to introduce postabortion care services in Niger; an advocacy project focused on preventing the spread of HIV among young people in Kenya, Mali, Niger, and the United Republic of Tanzania (also in collaboration with UNAIDS); research to develop a strategy on meeting the needs of rural girls in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal; and the adaptation of a health education flipchart for use among indigenous populations in Panama.

Between 2001-2004, FCI worked with UNICEF in Bolivia to develop radio segments in indigenous languages on women's right to maternal health services under the national maternal health law, and in Mali to develop a high-school peer education program on sexual and reproductive health. Lastly, FCI staff members have attended numerous technical consultations and meetings held by the WHO on reproductive health issues and presented on partnerships to advance reproductive health at WHO's Meeting of Interested Parties in Geneva in November 2003.
