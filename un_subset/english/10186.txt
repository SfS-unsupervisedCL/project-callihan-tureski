UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/701 21 June 1999 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: FRENCH LETTER DATED 21 JUNE 1999 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF GERMANY TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL I have the honour to draw your attention to the statement issued on 18 June 1999 by the Presidency of the European Union on the Ethiopian/Eritrean intervention in Somalia (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the text of this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Dieter KASTRUP Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nations English Page Annex [Original: English and French] Statement on the Ethiopian/Eritrean intervention in Somalia issued on 18 June 1999 by the Presidency of the European Union The European Union is deeply concerned at the renewed outbreak of fighting at the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea and reiterates its urgent appeal to both parties to halt the war and to settle their conflict through negotiations on the basis of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) framework agreement, which both sides have accepted. The European Union urges OAU to further intensify its efforts aimed at an immediate cessation of hostilities and the implementation of the OAU framework agreement supported by the United Nations Security Council. The Union reiterates its commitment to assist in the implementation process. The European Union is also very concerned at the illicit delivery of weapons, military equipment and military assistance to factions and other groups in Somalia in violation of the arms embargo imposed by Security Council resolution 733 (1992) of 23 January 1992, as well as at the dangers of destabilization of neighbouring countries and the spreading of terrorism produced by this influx of arms. Aware of the security implications of the situation in Somalia for the countries of the region, the European Union calls on Ethiopia and Eritrea to stop military intervention in Somalia, re-establish their cooperation within the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the Standing Committee and help the Somalis to settle the problems deriving from their long civil war, which cannot be solved through military escalation and further fighting. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, the associated country Cyprus and the European Free Trade Association countries, members of the European Economic Area align themselves with this statement.
