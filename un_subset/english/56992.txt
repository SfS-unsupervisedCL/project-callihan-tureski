Sixty-fifth session Agenda items 143 and 159 Administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations Financing of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 and proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions Appropriation 2009/10 Expenditure for 2009/10 Unencumbered balance for 2009/10 Appropriation for 2010/11 Projected expenditure for 2010/11a Estimated unencumbered balance for 2010/11a Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2011/12 Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2011/12 a Estimates as at 28 February 2011. 1. The recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions in paragraph 32 below would entail a reduction of $14,141,400 in the proposed budget for the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (A/65/740). The Advisory Committee has made additional observations and recommendations in the paragraphs below. 2. The general report of the Advisory Committee on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/65/743) contains its views and recommendations on a number of cross-cutting issues. In the present report, the Committee deals with resources and other items that relate specifically to UNAMID. 3. In considering the Secretary-General's proposals for UNAMID for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (A/65/740), the Advisory Committee has taken into account the recommendations of the Board of Auditors related to the Operation (see A/65/5 (Vol. II), chap. II) and has made specific comments thereon in paragraphs 64 and 65 below. In addition, the report of the Committee on the Board's report on the United Nations peacekeeping operations is contained in document A/65/782. The Advisory Committee reiterates the need for the expeditious implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Board of Auditors. 4. The documents reviewed and those used for background by the Advisory Committee in its consideration of the financing of UNAMID are listed at the end of the present report. II. Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 5. The General Assembly, by its resolution 63/258 B, appropriated an amount of $1,598,942,200 gross ($1,573,881,900 net) for the maintenance of UNAMID for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. Expenditures for the period amounted to $1,547,855,300 gross ($1,520,571,300 net), resulting in an unencumbered balance of $51,086,900 gross ($53,310,600 net), which represents, in gross terms, 3.2 per cent of the total appropriation. 6. Underexpenditures were incurred, inter alia, under: (a) Military contingents ($67,700,500, or 13.2 per cent), owing primarily to reduced requirements for rations as a result of: (i) a decrease in the ceiling/man rate for fresh rations; (ii) lower than budgeted warehousing, refrigeration and transportation costs; and (iii) replacing two days' worth of fresh rations with reserve ration packs during each 28-day consumption period. The reduction was also due to lower actual requirements for the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for equipment and lower than planned travel costs; (b) Formed police units ($20,539,000, or 29.2 per cent), attributable primarily to lower actual requirements for the reimbursement of formed police unit-contributing countries for major equipment and to reduced requirements for rations; (c) National staff ($4,255,600, or 7.6 per cent), as a result of reduced requirements for hazardous duty station allowance, higher than anticipated vacancy rates for National Officers and national General Service staff, and the lower than budgeted exchange rate for the local currency against the United States dollar; (d) Facilities and infrastructure ($26,386,900, or 10.9 per cent), owing primarily to reduced requirements for construction services as a result of the cancellation of a contract and for self-sustainment reimbursements to contributing Governments, offset in part by additional requirements for the unplanned acquisition of equipment; (e) Air transportation ($6,432,900, or 3.1 per cent), owing primarily to reduced requirements for petrol, oil and lubricants as a result of the non-deployment of three fixed-wing and five rotary-wing aircraft, the lower than budgeted price of aviation fuel and reduced operational and maintenance fees; (f) Communications ($3,100,800, or 5.3 per cent), attributable primarily to lower than planned charges for low-density VSAT terminals in the community policing centres, lower than planned usage of telephone services and reduced requirements for self-sustainment reimbursement. 7. The above-mentioned underexpenditures were offset, in part, by additional requirements under, inter alia: (a) United Nations police ($4,711,500, or 3.2 per cent), owing primarily to the payment of the full amount of mission subsistence allowance to an average of 2,723 police officers, as compared to the budgeted number of 1,083; (b) International staff ($27,738,100, or 17.2 per cent), attributable primarily to the faster than anticipated recruitment of international civilian personnel, which resulted in a lower than budgeted vacancy rate, as well as to higher requirements for international staff salaries and related costs pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/250; (c) General temporary assistance ($379,700, or 8.8 per cent), owing primarily to the recording of expenditures relating to 54 temporary positions that were discontinued; (d) Government provided personnel ($26,700, or 11 per cent), resulting from the faster than planned deployment of Corrections Officers and the requirement to pay the full amount of the mission subsistence allowance; (e) Consultants ($249,700, or 52 per cent), attributable primarily to unbudgeted consultancies relating to: (i) developing a partnership and resource-mobilization strategy for a railway project; (ii) conceptualizing, planning and implementing the overall workplan of the Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation; (iii) implementing the travel management contract; (iv) designing information materials; and (v) assisting the UNAMID hostage crisis committee to ensure the secure and unconditional release of hostages. The increase was also due to the engagement of consultants to carry out supplementary training activities; (f) Official travel ($5,364,700, or 117.6 per cent), as a result of the higher than budgeted costs of non-training travel undertaken within and outside the mission area relating, inter alia, to the increased logistical, administrative and substantive support provided to team sites and to support for the Joint Mediation Support Team during the peace talks and related political consultations for the Doha peace process; (g) Ground transportation ($4,872,900, or 15.5 per cent), owing to the unplanned acquisition of 78 light and medium buses, 3 drilling rigs and compressors, 10 garbage trucks, CarLog equipment and licence-plate embossing equipment; (h) Special equipment ($3,043,800, or 80.4 per cent), attributable to higher than budgeted requirements for the reimbursement of contributing Governments for self-sustainment costs; (i) Other supplies, services and equipment ($30,748,100, or 155.7 per cent), owing to the unbudgeted use of a third-party logistics provider to clear the backlog of shipments of United Nations-owned equipment at Port Sudan, the higher than budgeted cost of bank charges and transaction costs outside Khartoum, and the unbudgeted acquisition of body armour and ballistic helmets, postponed from 2008/09 owing to the expiration of the relevant contract. 8. As indicated in paragraph 7 (i) above, during the performance period, the Operation entered into a contract with a third-party logistics provider in order to clear the backlog of shipments of United Nations-owned equipment at Port Sudan. In paragraph 92 of the performance report on the budget of UNAMID (A/65/631), the Secretary-General indicates that the value of the contract amounted to $24 million. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that UNAMID had decided to seek a third-party provider for that service because its in-house capacities were limited: redeploying uniformed personnel to accompany road convoys would have prevented those personnel from performing their core functions and the Operation had only a limited number of support staff to deal with cargo clearance and handling. 9. The Advisory Committee was further informed that the contract, which had been awarded following a standard competitive bidding process and on the recommendation of the Headquarters Committee on Contracts and the Local Committee on Contracts, included: customs clearance at Port Sudan and at all major airports in the Sudan; inland freight forwarding using road and rail networks (where possible); outland freight forwarding in neighbouring countries and to troop- and/or police-contributing countries; airlifting of cargo (in case of emergency); provision of warehousing facilities for cargo storage; clearance and inland transportation of heavy equipment; and riverine transportation (which had not been used). The contractor assumed all liabilities for the goods transported until their delivery to their final destination in Darfur. As at 4 April 2011, a total of 5,150 25-feet containers and 739 vehicles had been cleared from Port Sudan. The Advisory Committee expects that, as the Operation reaches full deployment and enters a maintenance phase, every effort will be made to carry out freight forwarding activities in-house. 10. In paragraph 81 of the aforementioned performance report, the Secretary-General indicates that during the performance period, UNAMID incurred overexpenditures owing to the unforeseen acquisition of, inter alia, 78 light and medium buses (see also para. 7 (g) above). According to the Secretary-General, the buses were acquired to mitigate the effects of the carjacking of four-wheel-drive vehicles and to accommodate larger numbers of passengers. During its consideration of the performance report, the Advisory Committee was informed that, in the continued absence of a peace agreement, the level of criminal activity had increased in parts of the mission area, owing in part to the climate of impunity. Since only one type of United Nations vehicle was being targeted by carjackers, namely Toyota Land Cruiser "Buffalo" four-wheel-drives, the Operation, in consultation with the Department of Safety and Security, had decided to withdraw those vehicles from use in high-risk areas. The newly acquired buses would now be used for patrolling and to transport staff to and from work. The Committee notes, in this connection, that during the 2011/12 period, the Operation's disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme will include activities specifically aimed at reducing banditry and criminality (see A/65/740, para. 188). The Advisory Committee understands that peacekeeping missions must sometimes adjust their resources in order to respond to evolving situations on the ground and is mindful of the imperative to ensure staff safety. In this case, however, given that UNAMID has in excess of 3,000 vehicles, the Committee considers that the Operation should have been able to reconfigure its fleet in such a way as to accommodate the changed requirements from within existing resources. 11. In its report on the financial performance and proposed budget of UNAMID for the 2008/09 and 2010/11 periods, respectively (A/64/660/Add.13), the Advisory Committee noted that a number of outputs and activities planned by UNAMID for the 2008/09 period had not been implemented and that its financial performance reflected significant variations compared to the planned indicators. The Committee therefore stressed that the Operation should improve the accuracy of its budget forecasting (see A/64/660/Add.13, para. 11). The Advisory Committee observes that the performance report of the Secretary-General for the period 2009/10 (A/65/631) shows a similar trend: a significant number of planned outputs were not completed or only partially completed, and there were notable variances under a number of items of expenditure. The Advisory Committee also notes, however, that in several cases external factors are cited as the reason for the Operation's inability to fully achieve its objectives. For example, under component 1: peace process, the Secretary-General indicates that weak support for the Darfur Peace Agreement and the failure of the parties to the conflict to enter into any subsequent agreements hampered progress (see A/65/631, para. 37). Similarly, under component 2: security, the lack of an enforceable peace agreement between the parties, delays in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process and restrictions on the movement of troops imposed operational limitations on planned mandated activities (see A/65/631, para. 44). The Advisory Committee is cognizant of the difficulties faced by UNAMID in terms of planning and forecasting, and recognizes that the external factors cited by the Secretary-General in his report create particular difficulties for the Operation in terms of achieving its objectives. Nevertheless, the Committee trusts that UNAMID will redouble its efforts to implement all the expected accomplishments set out in the results-based budgeting frameworks for the 2011/12 period. 12. The comments of the Advisory Committee on the information presented in the performance report regarding individual objects of expenditure can be found, where relevant, in the discussion of the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 in the paragraphs below. III. Financial position and information on performance for the current period 13. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 14 March 2011, a total of $6,211,472,000 had been assessed on Member States in respect of UNAMID since its inception. Payments received as at that date amounted to $5,868,103,000, leaving an outstanding balance of $343,370,000. As at 21 March 2011, taking into account a three-month operating reserve of $330,046,000 (excluding reimbursements to troop-contributing countries), the cash available to the Operation amounted to $791,154,000. 14. The Advisory Committee was also informed that, as at 31 December 2010, $42,259,000 was owed for troops and $94,659,000 was owed for contingent-owned equipment. With regard to death and disability compensation, the Committee was informed that, as at 28 February 2011, $1,333,600 had been paid in respect of 55 claims since the inception of UNAMID. Unliquidated obligations amounted to $173,400 and four claims were pending. The Committee was further informed, upon enquiry, that as at 4 April 2011, two of the four pending claims had been paid and the remaining two were awaiting clarification/confirmation. The Advisory Committee expects that the outstanding claims will be settled expeditiously. 15. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 28 February 2011, the human resources incumbency for UNAMID for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 was as follows: Category Authorizeda Encumbered Vacancy rate (percentage) Military observers Military contingents United Nations police Formed police units Posts International staff National staff General temporary assistance United Nations Volunteers a Represents the highest authorized strength for the period. 16. The Advisory Committee was provided with a table of current and projected expenditures for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 (see annex I). As at 28 February 2011, expenditures for the period amounted to $1,045,328,100 against an apportionment of $1,808,127,500 gross. For the entire financial period, current and projected expenditures amount to $1,792,053,800, leaving a projected unencumbered balance of $16,073,700. IV. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 A. Mandate and planned results 17. The mandate of UNAMID was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1769 (2007). The most recent extension of the mandate, to 31 July 2011, was authorized by the Council in its resolution 1935 (2010). As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report on the proposed budget (A/65/740), UNAMID is mandated to help the Security Council achieve the overall objective of a lasting political solution and sustained security in Darfur. Within that objective, the Operation will, during the 2011/12 period, contribute to a number of expected accomplishments, as set out in the results-based-budgeting frameworks. Those frameworks include the following components: peace process; security; rule of law, governance and human rights; humanitarian, recovery and development liaison; and support. 18. The Secretary-General indicates that unity of command and control and a single chain of command are reflected in the UNAMID reporting structure. As indicated in paragraphs 5 to 7 of the report on the proposed budget, the Joint Special Representative of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission and of the Secretary-General of the United Nations has overall authority over UNAMID, oversees the implementation of its mandate and is responsible for its management and functioning. The Joint Special Representative implements the strategic directives issued by the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations and the African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security, and reports, through them, to the Secretary-General and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, respectively. The Force Commander and the Police Commissioner, both appointed by the African Union in consultation with the United Nations, report to the Joint Special Representative and exercise command and control over the military and police activities, respectively, of the Operation. 19. As indicated in paragraph 8 of the report on the proposed budget, backstopping and command and control structures for UNAMID are provided by the United Nations. The Joint Support and Coordination Mechanism, which is staffed by both United Nations and African Union personnel, is located in Addis Ababa and is responsible for liaising between the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the African Union Peace and Security Department on matters related to the deployment of UNAMID. The Advisory Committee recalls that, in its report on the proposed budget for UNAMID for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011, it noted that a comprehensive review of the functions and responsibilities of the Joint Support and Coordination Mechanism was under way (see A/64/660/Add.13, para. 49). In his present report, the Secretary-General indicates that, in view of the establishment of the United Nations Office to the African Union and the related integration of the United Nations peace and security presence in Addis Ababa, it is anticipated that the level of the representational tasks assigned to the Mechanism will be reduced. Accordingly, having reviewed its functions, the Secretary-General is proposing the reassignment of one post at the P-5 level from the Joint Support and Coordination Mechanism to the Office of the Chief of Staff (see A/65/740, paras. 75 and 76; see also para. 40 and annex II below). The Advisory Committee notes the Secretary-General's decision to adjust the staffing complement of the Joint Support and Coordination Mechanism to reflect the level of its representational tasks and expects that, once the United Nations Office to the African Union is operating at full capacity, further opportunities for downsizing will be explored. 20. With regard to the structure of the Operation, the Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 9 of the Secretary-General's report that UNAMID is organized in three sectors, covering the three Darfur States, with leadership and direction throughout the mission area provided from the headquarters in El Fasher. Three regional offices, in El Fasher (co-located with mission headquarters), Nyala and El Geneina, supervise and coordinate operations in Northern, Southern and Western Darfur, respectively. A regional sub-office in Zalingei, which reports to the El Geneina regional office, coordinates activities in the Zalingei subsector. UNAMID also has established offices in key locations outside Darfur, including a Khartoum Liaison Office (co-located with the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS)) and the Joint Support and Coordination Mechanism in Addis Ababa (see para. 19 above). Personnel from the military and police components maintain close liaison and coordination with UNMIS. 21. The substantive activities to be carried out by UNAMID during the 2011/12 period are described in paragraphs 12 to 17 of the report on the proposed budget. In particular, the Operation will focus on the following four priorities: (a) the protection of civilians by ensuring safe, timely and unhindered humanitarian access as well as the safety and security of humanitarian personnel; (b) the promotion of the peace process and the implementation of a comprehensive agreement and sustained ceasefire, once achieved; (c) the provision of support related to the rule of law, including the strengthening of the judiciary and prison system, and human rights and gender capacity-building; and (d) early recovery and reconstruction assistance, through the provision of area security to the United Nations country team and other humanitarian partners. In paragraph 11 of his report, the Secretary-General highlights the ongoing challenges facing UNAMID as a result of the continued lack of a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable settlement to the conflict. 22. During its consideration of the proposed budget, the Advisory Committee was informed by the Joint Special Representative that UNAMID was an unusual peacekeeping mission in that it was operating in the absence of an enforceable peace agreement. However, as indicated in paragraph 13 of the Secretary-General's report, the UNAMID-supported Joint Mediation Support Team is playing an active role in the peace process by, inter alia, building on the achievements of the civil society conferences held in Doha and continuing to expand consultations with Darfurian civil society in order to promote an inclusive and comprehensive political solution to the conflict. The Committee was also informed that, in preparation for a breakthrough in the negotiations, UNAMID had begun preliminary consultations with the African Union High-level Implementation Panel regarding the launch of the Darfur Political Process, a dialogue designed to build consensus and to ensure the durability of a peace agreement. 23. The support activities to be carried out by the Operation during the 2011/12 period are detailed in paragraphs 18 to 35 of the report on the proposed budget. Those activities include the completion of the multi-year construction and engineering plans; the improvement of rations and fuel management arrangements; the introduction of additional measures to overcome the ongoing challenges in the area of staff recruitment and retention; the provision of uninterrupted voice and data links to all areas; and the ground and air transportation of personnel and assets. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 18 of the report that support activities will enter a maintenance phase during 2011/12, although, according to the Secretary-General, UNAMID will continue to encounter specific challenges deriving from the arid environment, long logistics chains and lines of communication, and the large area of operations. 24. As for regional mission cooperation, the Secretary-General indicates in paragraph 38 of his report on the proposed budget that, in accordance with Security Council resolutions 1769 (2007) and 1590 (2005), a number of UNAMID activities will be closely coordinated with UNMIS, which is mandated to resolve issues at the national level in the Sudan. He also notes, in paragraph 39, that UNAMID and UNMIS will continue to work jointly on common support issues in accordance with the memorandum of understanding setting out the modalities for the utilization of common services signed by the two missions on 31 July 2008. 25. Paragraphs 43 to 53 of the Secretary-General's report contain information on partnerships and coordination with the United Nations country team. In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes that UNAMID has restructured the former Humanitarian Liaison Office and renamed it the Protection Strategy and Coordination Division. In addition, new terms of reference for the Director of the Division have been developed, in line with the enhanced responsibilities assigned to the Director following the upward reclassification of the post from the D-1 to the D2 level. Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the name change was intended to better distinguish the functions and responsibilities of the Division from those of the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator. The Committee was further informed that, once recruited, the Director of the Division would be responsible for ensuring an integrated approach to the comprehensive strategy for the protection of civilians through the provision of guidance and training and the identification of innovative solutions to problems. The Director would also ensure the coordination of the strategy with the United Nations country team and develop close working relationships with all concerned actors. 26. During its consideration of the proposed budget for UNAMID, the Advisory Committee was informed that the comprehensive strategy for the protection of civilians aimed to provide operational guidance on the implementation of the Operation's protection mandate. The main components of the strategy were as follows: ensuring the fulfilment by the Government, armed groups and other nonState actors of their responsibilities to protect civilians in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law; protecting civilians from physical acts of violence; providing freedom of access to populations at risk; and preventing violations of human rights and offering an effective response, in particular with regard to women and children. B. Resource requirements 27. The proposed budget for UNAMID for the financial period 2011/12 amounts to $1,708,748,400 gross ($1,680,586,600 net), representing a decrease of $99,379,100, or 5.5 per cent, in gross terms, compared to the apportionment of $1,808,127,500 for the preceding period. The proposed budget provides for the deployment of 260 military observers, 19,295 military contingent personnel, 3,772 United Nations police officers, 2,660 formed police unit personnel, 1,289 international staff, 3,381 national staff, including 37 positions funded under general temporary assistance, 616 United Nations Volunteers and 6 Government-provided personnel. An analysis of variances is provided in section III (paras. 155-188) of the Secretary-General's report (A/65/740). 28. The cost estimates for the 2011/12 period reflect efficiency gains in the amount of $17,086,000 resulting from the reduction in the Operation's air fleet by two fixed-wing aircraft (1 L-100 and 1 IL-76) and five helicopters (4 MI-35 and 1 MI-8MTV). According to the Secretary-General, that reduction has been possible owing to the establishment of the Transportation and Movements Integrated Control Centre at the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe, Uganda. During its consideration of the proposed budget for UNAMID for the 2011/12 period, however, the Advisory Committee was informed that neither the L-100 fixed-wing nor the four MI-35 helicopters had ever been deployed to the mission area and that, whereas the primary focus of the Control Centre was on planning the movement of personnel and cargo between missions in the region, the Operation's military helicopters were provided under specific letter of assist arrangements that precluded their use outside the mission area. 29. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the support concept of the Transportation and Movements Integrated Control Centre involved the optimum utilization of integral and regional strategic transport resources by six field missions (UNAMID, UNMIS, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Political Office for Somalia, the United Nations Office in Burundi and the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic). Accordingly, UNAMID was able to capitalize on the use of non-integral aircraft and a regional freight forwarding contract to meet its transportation needs without having to contract those services individually. That approach was expected to lead to efficiency gains (see also A/65/743, para. 87). At present, two weekly flights operated regularly between Entebbe and El Fasher for the transportation of UNAMID personnel. The Control Centre was also carrying out troop rotation flights for UNAMID troops (it was envisaged that, from April to August 2011, 10 troop rotations would be carried out using aircraft based in Entebbe) and would, upon request, coordinate heavy lift cargo support. The Advisory Committee was also informed that UNAMID considered that one IL-76 aircraft would be sufficient to meet its heavy lift cargo needs during the budget period, as it was expecting to reach over 90 per cent deployment by the end of the 2010/11 period. 1. Military and police personnel Approved 2010/11a Proposed 2011/12a Variance a Represents highest level of authorized strength. 30. The estimated requirements for military and police personnel for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 amount to $782,231,400, reflecting an increase of $7,941,000, or 1 per cent, compared to the apportionment of $774,290,400 for 2010/11. The variance is due primarily to an increase of $1,213,100, or 10.6 per cent, under military observers, owing to the deployment of 20 additional military observers and to the application of lower delayed deployment factors, and an increase of $13,052,400, or 7.8 per cent, under United Nations police, attributable mainly to a lower delayed deployment factor (see para. 31 below), offset in part by lower requirements under military contingents and formed police units (decreases of $3,353,400, or 0.6 per cent, and $2,971,100, or 4 per cent, respectively) owing primarily to reduced requirements for rations and for reimbursements to troop- and police-contributing countries for major contingent-owned equipment. According to the Secretary-General, the adjustment of the composition of the military component (an increase of 20 military observers and a decrease of 20 military contingents) is designed to improve its overall effectiveness (see A/65/740, para. 14). 31. The cost estimates for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 take into account delayed deployment factors of 10 per cent for military observers, 8 per cent for military contingents, 10 per cent for United Nations police and 10 per cent for formed police units, as compared to 12 per cent, 12 per cent, 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively, for the preceding period. 32. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 28 February 2011, 2,930 of the authorized strength of 3,772 police officers, or 77.7 per cent, had been deployed (see table in para. 15 above). However, during its consideration of the proposed budget for UNAMID for 2011/12, the Committee was informed that the Operation was experiencing difficulty in obtaining visas for non-Arabic-speaking United Nations police officers. The Committee was subsequently informed that, as at 27 April 2011, 1,077 visas were pending. Taking into account the current deployment status of United Nations police, as well as the aforementioned visa delays, the Advisory Committee recommends the application of a delayed deployment factor of 17 per cent for United Nations police, rather than the 10 per cent factor applied by the Secretary-General. 2. Civilian personnel Approved 2010/11 Proposed 2011/12 National staffa Temporary positionsb a Includes National Professional Officers and national General Service staff. b Funded under general temporary assistance. 33. The estimated requirements for civilian personnel for the 2011/12 period amount to $291,295,600, reflecting a decrease of $65,427,900, or 18.3 per cent, compared to the apportionment of $356,723,500 for 2010/11. The overall decrease is the result of: (a) a decrease of $53,756,000, or 20.5 per cent, under international staff, owing mainly to lower requirements for salaries, including post adjustment and common staff costs, as a result, inter alia, of the application of the new methodology for the calculation of international staff costs, including adjustments made pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/248; (b) a decrease of $16,230,600, or 24.7 per cent, under national staff, attributable mainly to lower anticipated exchange rates between the local currency and the United States dollar during the budget period; offset in part by (c) an increase of $3,607,100, or 14.6 per cent, under United Nations Volunteers, owing primarily to the application of a lower vacancy rate (see para. 34 below) and to additional requirements for rest and recreation allowance pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/248; and (d) an increase of $951,600, or 21.5 per cent, under general temporary assistance, owing primarily to additional requirements for international staff as a result of the application of a lower vacancy rate (see para. 34 below). 34. The following vacancy rates have been applied to the cost estimates for civilian personnel for the 2011/12 period: 15 per cent for international staff (as compared to 25 per cent for the preceding period); 30 per cent for National Officers and 20 per cent for national General Service staff (the same as the preceding period); 20 per cent for United Nations Volunteers (as compared to 25 per cent for the preceding period); and 10 per cent and 25 per cent for international and national temporary positions, respectively (as compared to 20 per cent for both categories for the preceding period). 35. As indicated in paragraph 29 of the Secretary-General's report, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/248 on the harmonization of conditions of service in the field, the budget estimates for UNAMID reflect the proposed abolition of 199 international posts and positions and the proposed conversion of 55 international Field Service posts and positions to national General Service staff posts and positions (see paras. 42 and 43 below). Vacancy rates for international and national staff have been adjusted accordingly (see para. 34 above). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that 180 of the 254 posts and positions identified for abolition/conversion had been vacant for more than one year. The Advisory Committee's views and comments on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 65/248 are reflected in the context of its general report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/65/743). 36. In both the performance report and the report on the proposed budget, the Secretary-General alludes to the difficulties experienced by UNAMID in terms of the recruitment and retention of qualified staff owing, inter alia, to the harsh living conditions and isolation in the mission area, as well as the volatile security situation (some sectors of the Operation remain in phase IV) (see A/65/631, para. 17, and A/65/740, para. 28). In this connection, the Advisory Committee notes that, in response to a finding of the Office of Internal Oversight Services concerning inadequate staffing levels, UNAMID has taken a number of steps to attract new staff, including outreach activities, proposed additional financial incentives for staff retention and improved social amenities (see A/65/740, section V.D). Upon enquiry, the Committee was informed that the proposal for a Darfur special hardship allowance, akin to that granted to staff at the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, had been rejected by the International Civil Service Commission. 37. In view of the resource-intensive nature of the recruitment process, the Advisory Committee is particularly concerned about the number of successful candidates who have declined offers of appointment: in paragraph 28 of his report on the proposed budget (A/65/740), the Secretary-General indicates that as at January 2011, 242 candidates had declined offers and 416 had separated from service, resulting in an average turnover of 10 staff members per month since the Operation's inception. During its consideration of the proposed budget for UNAMID, the Committee was informed that the Operation was considering involving staff counsellors in the recruitment process in order to ensure that candidates who were offered positions were able and willing to withstand the harsh conditions. 38. The Advisory Committee welcomes the steps taken and envisaged to address the staffing difficulties experienced by UNAMID. However, as the Operation reaches full deployment, it will be even more important to ensure that sufficient numbers of civilian staff are on board in order to implement all mandated activities in an effective and efficient manner. Accordingly, the Committee urges UNAMID, in conjunction with relevant Headquarters departments, to explore additional measures to recruit and retain qualified staff, including the further improvement of social amenities, the availability of adequate accommodation for all civilian staff and the provision of welfare and support services specifically designed to assist staff to cope with the harsh conditions and isolation. The Secretary-General should report on the results of those efforts in the context of the relevant performance report. Furthermore, as indicated in its general report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (see A/65/743, para. 49), the Advisory Committee believes that consideration should also be given to introducing targeted recruitment for missions like UNAMID, where large numbers of candidates continue to turn down offers of appointment. The Committee has commented in more detail on issues relating to staff recruitment and retention, as well as staff welfare, in the context of its aforementioned general report. Recommendations on posts/positions 39. The Secretary-General is proposing a net overall decrease of 231 posts and positions for UNAMID, comprising a net decrease of 252 international posts and 1 temporary position, offset by a net increase of 22 national posts. The net overall decrease of 231 posts and positions would result from the proposed establishment of 23 posts and positions and the proposed abolition of 254 posts and positions. The Secretary-General is also proposing the redeployment/reassignment of 166 posts/ positions. A detailed summary of the proposed staffing changes is presented in annex II to the present report. Reassignments/redeployments 40. As mentioned in paragraph 39 above, the Secretary-General is proposing a total of 166 redeployments and reassignments (see annex II for a detailed breakdown of the proposals). The Advisory Committee notes, inter alia, that it is proposed to redeploy the entire Facilities Management Unit (145 posts and positions) from the Engineering Section to the General Services Section. According to the Secretary-General, the transfer of the Unit to the Engineering Section, approved during the 2010/11 period, has proven extremely difficult to implement on account of the existing workload of that Section. The Secretary-General asserts, in support of his proposal, that a clear separation of responsibilities between construction and heavy maintenance activities and the management of those activities will provide a more efficient, effective and robust structure (see A/65/740, paras. 115, 116 and 121). The Committee also notes that as indicated in paragraph 19 above, as a result of the review conducted following the establishment of the United Nations Office to the African Union, the Secretary-General is also proposing the reassignment of one post of Senior Political Affairs Officer at the P5 level from the Joint Support and Coordination Mechanism to the Office of the Chief of Staff (see A/65/740, paras. 63 and 76). In addition, as part of the global field support strategy, 11 posts are proposed for redeployment/reassignment to the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe (see A/65/740, paras. 131-135; see also paras. 56 and 57 below). The Advisory Committee has no objection to the Secretary-General's proposals. 41. With specific reference to the proposed reassignment of a post of Principal Security Adviser in the Security and Safety Section at the D-1 level to the Office of the Chief of Staff to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff (see A/65/740, paras. 59-61 and 126-128), the Advisory Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the proposal responded to a recommendation emanating from a meeting of the heads of political affairs components and mission chiefs of staff, held in July 2010, at which it was acknowledged that large missions needed to establish Deputy Chief of Staff posts to ensure, inter alia, that chiefs of staff could focus on their substantive responsibilities and ensure efficient management. The Committee was also informed that, at UNAMID, the Chief of Staff had extensive responsibilities, including the supervision and coordination of the work of an unusually high number of sections/ components. It was also indicated to the Committee that the post of Principal Security Adviser had never been filled. Given the unusually heavy workload of the Chief of Staff at UNAMID, the Advisory Committee has no objection to the reassignment of a post of Principal Security Adviser at the D1 level in the Security and Safety Section to the Office of the Chief of Staff to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff. The Committee emphasizes, however, that its recommendation in this case should not set a precedent. Conversions 42. As indicated in paragraph 35 above, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/248, the Secretary-General is proposing the conversion of 55 international Field Service posts and positions to national General Service posts and positions (see annex II for a detailed breakdown of the proposals). The Advisory Committee has no objection to the conversions proposed by the Secretary-General. Abolitions 43. The Secretary-General is proposing the abolition of 231 posts and positions (see annex II for a detailed breakdown of the proposals). Of those, 199 would be abolished pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/248 (see para. 35 above). In addition, 30 national General Service posts of Language Assistant in the Police Division would be abolished as a result of the planned deployment of more Arabic-speaking police officers (see A/65/740, para. 85) and 2 national General Service posts of Driver in the Humanitarian Recovery and Assistance Liaison Unit would be abolished as a result of lower than anticipated requirements owing to movement restrictions because of the security situation (see A/65/740, para. 98). The Advisory Committee has no objection to the abolitions proposed by the Secretary-General. 3. Operational costs (United States dollars) Apportionment 2010/11 44. The estimated operational costs for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 amount to $635,221,400, representing a decrease of $41,892,200, or 6.2 per cent, compared to the apportionment for the preceding period. The decrease is due mainly to lower requirements under consultants, facilities and infrastructure, ground transportation, information technology and medical, offset in part by increased requirements under official travel, air transportation and other supplies, services and equipment. Official travel 45. Estimated requirements for official travel for the 2011/12 period amount to $4,684,900, an increase of $198,800, or 4.4 per cent, compared to the apportionment for the preceding period. In paragraph 174 of his report on the proposed budget, the Secretary-General indicates that the variance is attributable primarily to a 13 per cent increase in requirements for travel outside the mission area. The Advisory Committee notes, in particular, that the additional resources would be used to support travel related to mediation for an inclusive and comprehensive settlement to the conflict in Darfur, in particular support for the Joint Mediation Support Team during the peace talks and related political consultations for the Doha peace process, as well as travel to meetings with various regional and international partners. Given the notable increase in the resources requested for travel outside the mission area, the Advisory Committee expects that UNAMID will monitor its official travel requirements closely during the budget period. Facilities and infrastructure 46. Estimated requirements for facilities and infrastructure for the 2011/12 period amount to $181,327,400, a decrease of $41,931,600, or 18.8 per cent, compared to the apportionment of $223,259,000 for the preceding period. As indicated in paragraphs 176 and 177 of the report on the proposed budget, the variance is attributable primarily to reduced requirements for: (a) construction services, owing to the near completion of the multi-year projects; (b) the acquisition of related equipment, such as prefabricated facilities, water and septic tanks and generators, since the majority of the equipment required will be acquired before the budget period; and (c) reimbursement of troop- and police-contributing Governments for self-sustainment equipment. The cost estimates for construction services take into account the substantial investment funded in previous years, as well as the Operation's strategy to engage in-house resources and military enablers. The Advisory Committee notes, in particular, that the Operation's decision to use in-house capacity to carry out the remainder of its construction projects was due in part to the revocation, during the performance period, of a construction contract valued at $31.8 million as a result of the contractor's inability to mobilize the required resources and resolve the logistical challenges associated with the remoteness of building sites, the volatile security situation and the poor infrastructure (see A/65/631, para. 23). 47. In paragraph 18 of his report on the proposed budget for UNAMID, the Secretary-General indicates that key infrastructure, such as office and living accommodation, is now near completion. However, the Advisory Committee notes from the report that the Operation's multi-year construction project continues to be severely hindered by logistical challenges and that, as a result, the long-term plan, which was originally due to be completed in 2009/10, has been carried over into 2010/11 and 2011/12. According to the Secretary-General, by the end of 2010/11 the Operation will have completed 26 of the planned 36 military camps; 13 of the planned 19 enabling military camps; 13 of the planned 19 formed police unit camps; and 42 of the planned 70 community policing centres. Construction of the remaining 10 military camps, 6 enabling military camps, 6 formed police unit camps and 28 community policing centres will be completed during the 2011/12 period. The Secretary-General also indicates that the laying of asphalt roads in the four supercamps and gravel roads linking 15 team sites to major roads commenced in 2009/10 and will continue in 2011/12. In addition, the construction of airport terminals, aprons and taxiways at El Fasher, Nyala and El Geneina airports, as well as helipads for the safe landing of UNAMID aircraft in remote camps, is currently under way and will also continue into the budget period. The Advisory Committee has taken note of the large number of construction and engineering projects to be carried out during the budget period and of the logistical challenges faced and delays experienced by the Operation during the performance period. The Committee expects that UNAMID will supervise all construction and engineering projects closely to ensure that they are completed on schedule by the end of the 2011/12 period. 48. In the performance report, the Secretary-General indicates that the scarcity of water in Darfur remains a particular concern for UNAMID (see A/65/631, para. 24). Accordingly, the estimated requirements for facilities and infrastructure for 2011/12 include resources for the generation and sustainability of water resources to ensure the provision of safe and adequate water to military, police and civilian personnel. In his report on the proposed budget, the Secretary-General indicates that, during the budget period, the Operation intends to improve its wastewater management programme in order to reduce its groundwater use to 50 per cent of its requirements; continue to install wastewater treatment plants; construct water retaining structures, including one earth dam and three reservoirs, in order to improve water conservation; harvest rainwater in four supercamps; and commence a groundwater surveillance programme, including the establishment of databases to facilitate the sustainable use of water resources. In parallel, the Operation intends to enhance new water sources by surveying 20 sites and drilling 28 additional boreholes (see A/65/740, para. 25). The Advisory Committee notes the measures envisaged by the Operation to ensure the sustainability of its water supply. Communications 49. Estimated requirements for communications for the 2011/12 period amount to $51,743,900, a decrease of $1,996,700, or 3.7 per cent, compared to the apportionment for the preceding period. As indicated in paragraphs 183 and 184 of the report on the proposed budget, the variance is attributable mainly to reduced requirements for the acquisition of communications equipment owing to the completion of the related procurement action during the current period. The reduced requirements are offset in part by additional requirements for communications support services, reimbursement of troop- and police-contributing Governments for self-sustainment, spare parts and public information services. 50. During its consideration of the performance report for UNAMID for 2009/10, the Advisory Committee expressed concern about the Operation's inability to achieve a planned output relating to the support and maintenance of four FM broadcast radio stations because licences for FM stations were not issued (see A/65/631, planned outputs (communications) under expected accomplishment 5.1). It was explained to the Committee, upon enquiry, that in order to mitigate the impact of that situation on its activities, the Operation had now entered into a "bridging agreement" that allowed it to broadcast uncensored on existing State radio stations. Given the importance of public information activities, in particular radio broadcasts, to the successful implementation of the Operation's mandated activities, the Advisory Committee urges UNAMID to continue its efforts to obtain FM licences as soon as possible. Fuel management 51. In paragraph 23 of his report on the proposed budget, the Secretary-General indicates that in order to improve fuel management, UNAMID has discontinued a turnkey contract for the supply of fuel and, in July 2010, introduced a retail fuel management system to record and monitor its fuel consumption. That system will be introduced gradually in four phases, with full implementation expected by 31 December 2011, and will be applied to vehicles, generators, aircraft and oil and lubricants. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the system, which was intended to serve as an internal control mechanism to enhance accountability, consisted of a database with benchmarks that would measure fuel consumption electronically and automatically flag usage anomalies. The Secretary-General also states that the CarLog system will be installed in all vehicles at the Operation's headquarters, in Khartoum, and at sector headquarters in order to monitor fuel consumption. The Advisory Committee notes the additional measures taken by UNAMID to record and monitor fuel consumption and trusts that they will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its fuel management activities. Information on the results achieved should be provided in the context of the performance report for 2011/12. Rations management 52. During its consideration of the proposed budget for UNAMID, the Advisory Committee was provided with information on the average ceiling/man rate for rations at UNAMID as compared to UNMIS ($13.36 as compared to $7.07). The Committee was informed, in particular, that while the average actual food cost at UNAMID was lower than at UNMIS ($4.91 as compared to $5.34), transportation costs were significantly higher ($7.51 as compared to $1.66) on account of the delivery method (30 per cent by air and 70 per cent by road), the infrastructure limitations, the extended transportation and delivery times and the prevailing security situation in the Darfur region. In order to address that situation, UNAMID had taken steps to ensure that rations were delivered only by road and was providing advice and guidance to troop- and police-contributing countries on better warehousing and improved quality control. In addition, the Operation had decided to introduce a menu-based rations plan, which would provide greater flexibility and a choice of dietary preferences, and allow the Operation and the contingents to ensure that rations were ordered and consumed in accordance with actual requirements. Accordingly, as indicated in paragraph 22 of the Secretary-General's report on the proposed budget, the current long-term rations contract, which is valid until April 2012, will be reviewed. The Advisory Committee welcomes the measures taken by UNAMID to address the high cost of rations and notes the effect of those measures on the budget estimates for 2011/12 (see para. 30 above). Information on the new rations contract should be provided in the next budget submission. Quick-impact projects 53. Estimated requirements for quick-impact projects for 2011/12 amount to $4 million, the same amount as appropriated for the preceding period, and would provide for the implementation of 160 projects. As indicated in paragraph 152 of the report on the proposed budget for UNAMID, following a detailed needs assessment of quick-impact projects conducted in response to General Assembly resolution 61/276, it has been determined that a renewed programme of projects is essential to build confidence, support and goodwill among local populations. The support provided through such projects for social integration, cohesion and community infrastructure will allow the Operation to better contribute to expected peace in Darfur. According to the Secretary-General, in the short to medium term, quick-impact projects will be geared towards demonstrating progress in the national recovery process, improving access to rural and remote areas, providing support for rule of law functions and to local authorities and civil society in the areas of education, women's empowerment, health, agriculture, water facilities, sanitation, training and capacity-building, and the creation of short-term employment opportunities in vulnerable communities. As the Darfur peace process progresses, the projects will facilitate the creation of the enabling environment necessary to build confidence. 54. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with a table showing the implementation status of quick-impact projects for the last four financial periods (see annex III). The Committee is concerned about the low implementation rate of quick-impact projects in recent years: during the 2007/08 period, 42 of 43 approved projects were completed, but in 2008/09 and 2009/10 only 55 of 128 approved projects and 10 of 204 approved projects were completed, respectively, and, to date, none of the 106 projects approved for the 2010/11 period have been completed. In this connection, the Committee notes that in its report on the United Nations peacekeeping operations, the Board of Auditors also highlighted the low implementation rate of quick-impact projects at UNAMID (see A/65/5 (Vol. II), para. 100). 55. It was explained to the Advisory Committee, upon enquiry, that the slow pace of implementation was attributable primarily to the fragile security situation and poor infrastructure, which had hindered access to project sites, as well as to the limited capacity of local implementing partners. In order to overcome those challenges, the Operation had launched a detailed training programme for civilian, military and police personnel in order to strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity, and was also in the process of simplifying the related administrative and financial processes. While acknowledging the specific challenges faced by UNAMID in the implementation of quick-impact projects, the Advisory Committee emphasizes the importance of such projects as a way of enhancing relations between the Operation and the local population. The Committee expects that UNAMID will make every effort to implement all outstanding and planned projects in a timely manner. Other matters Regional Service Centre, Entebbe 56. The Advisory Committee recalls that, by its resolution 64/269, the General Assembly decided, within the framework of the global field support strategy, to establish a Regional Service Centre in Entebbe, Uganda, for the purpose of consolidating administrative and support functions from geographically grouped field missions into a stand-alone regional centre. As indicated in paragraph 41 of the proposed budget for UNAMID, the following four back-office functions have to date been identified for transfer to the Regional Service Centre on a pilot basis: check-in and check-out of field personnel; processing of education grants; operation of a regional training and conference centre; and operation of the Transportation and Movements Integrated Control Centre. 57. In accordance with the above-mentioned resolution, the results-based budgeting frameworks for the Regional Service Centre, as well as the UNAMID share of the post and non-post resources for the Centre for 2011/12, are reflected under component 5 of the proposed budget (see A/65/740, sections I.E and II.J). The estimated requirements for UNAMID for 2011/12 in respect of the Centre amount to $3,385,400, of which $1,175,400 relates to the cost of 11 posts (1 D-1, 1 P-5, 2 P-4, 4 Field Service, 3 national General Service) and the remaining $2,210,000 relates to operational costs. The Advisory Committee notes that the aforementioned 11 posts are all to be redeployed/reassigned from other sections of the Operation (see annex II). The Advisory Committee has no objection to the Secretary-General's proposals relating to the UNAMID share of the post and non-post resources for the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe (see also para. 40 above). The Committee's detailed observations and recommendations on the role and functions of the Centre are contained in its general report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations (see A/65/743, section III.D). Mine detection and clearance activities 58. The estimated resource requirements for mine detection and mine-clearance services for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 amount to $10,715,000 and include the cost of funding for temporary international and national positions ($2,250,700), contracts for route assessment and explosive ordnance disposal ($6,500,000), travel ($389,200), other operating costs, including the acquisition of equipment, fuel, insurance, vehicle and communications maintenance and administrative costs and supplies ($818,200), and the management and service support fee of an implementing partner ($756,900) (see A/65/740, para. 149). Mine action services to be provided during the budget period include general explosive hazard assessments of 297 villages in Northern, Southern and Western Darfur, emergency unexploded ordnance assessments of 390 km2, route survey along 5,000 km of roads and routes suspected of contamination and demolition of 600 items of unexploded ordnance (see A/65/740, outputs under expected accomplishment 2.1). 59. With specific reference to mine risk education, the Advisory Committee notes that planned activities include the delivery, in coordination with the United Nations Children's Fund, of unexploded ordnance-risk education and training to 80,000 Darfurian civilians, and the implementation of a train-the-trainers programme for a total of 260 teacher/community leaders in order to have community-based unexploded ordnance-risk education focal points in remote areas (see A/65/740, outputs under expected accomplishment 7.1). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that in view of the ongoing security concerns in various parts of Darfur which were continuing to cause the displacement of populations, unexploded ordnance-risk education was provided to individuals whose daily activities were affected by contamination. The majority of the educational programmes were delivered at operational task sites and in the camps for internally displaced persons located on the outskirts of major towns (i.e. El Fasher, Nyala and El Geneina). In addition, the Ordnance Disposal Office provided awareness training for new UNAMID staff and national and international non-governmental organizations. The Advisory Committee welcomes the Operation's continued participation in demining activities, in particular those relating to mine risk education, and looks forward to receiving information on the results achieved in the context of the relevant performance report. Training 60. In paragraph 141 of his report on the proposed budget for UNAMID, the Secretary-General indicates that total estimated resource requirements for training for the 2011/12 period amount to $3,491,600. During that period, it is proposed that 1,500 participants (international and national staff as well as military and police personnel) will engage in training activities, which include on-the-job training within the mission area, as well as courses at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy. According to the Secretary-General, the primary focus of the Operation's training programme is to strengthen the substantive and technical capacity of staff in a number of areas. Resources in the amount of $717,200 will also be used to build national capacity in the areas of security and human rights, in implementation of the Operation's mandate (see A/65/740, paras. 143 and 144). 61. The Advisory Committee notes from the supplementary information provided to it that a large number of the planned training courses are to take place outside the mission area (235 of 297 courses for international staff and 84 of 140 courses for national staff). The Committee also notes from the report on the proposed budget that almost 50 per cent of the total resource requirements for training ($1,664,400 of $3,491,600) would be allocated to official travel (see A/65/740, para. 141). The Advisory Committee takes the view that, to the extent possible, training should be conducted in a way that minimizes costs relating to travel. The Committee deals with the issue of training in peacekeeping missions in the context of its general report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peacekeeping operations (A/65/743). Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 62. The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 15 of the report on the proposed budget that during the 2011/12 period, UNAMID, together with other United Nations partners, will intensify collaboration with the Darfur States committees and the North Sudan Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Commission on the planning and implementation of a programme for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants, including women and children associated with armed forces and groups, as provided for in the Darfur Peace Agreement and in subsequent agreements between the parties. As indicated in paragraphs 145 and 146 of that report, estimated resource requirements for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration for the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 amount to $4,975,000 and include provision of related support for the voluntary demobilization of 5,500 ex-combatants at an average cost of $635 per person. Upon request, the Committee was provided with the following cost breakdown: direct operational costs, $150 per person; transitional support package, $180 per person; transportation and resettlement, $200 per person; medical screening and counselling, $60 per person; counselling and reorientation advice, $45 per person. The Committee was informed, upon enquiry, that the per person cost of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration support at UNAMID was higher than in other peacekeeping missions owing to the high transportation costs necessitated by the specific environment in Darfur. Greening initiatives 63. In paragraph 26 of his report on the proposed budget, the Secretary-General indicates that, during the 2011/12 period, UNAMID will continue to strive to mitigate the environmental impact of its activities in view of Darfur's fragile ecosystem. As part of those efforts, the Operation intends to employ environmentally friendly construction techniques, including reduced reliance on timber and oven-fired bricks, and endeavour to lower fuel consumption through, inter alia, the increased use of solar power. During its consideration of the proposed budget, the Advisory Committee was informed that in January 2011, the Operation had launched a campaign entitled "One Million Trees", through which it aimed to plant 1 million trees over the forthcoming three years. As at 28 February 2011, 73,000 trees had been planted. In addition, four nurseries had been established, in collaboration with the Darfur Department of Forests, in order to cultivate 4 million drought-resistant seedlings per year. The seedlings would then be planted as part of a joint project with the World Food Programme, negotiations for which were at an advanced stage. The Advisory Committee commends UNAMID for its greening initiatives and looks forward to receiving information on their impact. Board of Auditors 64. Upon request, the Advisory Committee was provided with information on the steps taken and envisaged by the Operation to implement the recommendations of the Board of Auditors relating to the 2009/10 financial period, as contained in its report A/65/5 (Vol. II). The Committee was informed, inter alia, that in order to ensure strict compliance with the requirements of the Procurement Manual in relation to the solicitation and evaluation of bids (see A/65/5 (Vol. II), paras. 185 and 214), the structure of the Tender Opening Committee had been overhauled and standard operating procedures covering the functions and responsibilities of the Committee and its members had been issued, together with specific guidelines for the treatment of late bids. Similarly, the structure of the Local Committee on Contracts had been revised by nominating members and alternates, and a chairperson. The weekly meetings of the Tender Opening Committee and the Local Committee on Contracts had been scheduled in such a way as to ensure that there would be a quorum for the timely review of cases. With regard to the timely submission of claims for liquidated damages (see A/65/5 (Vol. II), paras. 195-197), the Advisory Committee was informed that such damages were considered on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Procurement Manual and the draft contracts management policy. The Officer-in-Charge of Mission Support at UNAMID had also issued guidance designating the Contracts Management Section as the focal point for the timely consideration of cases. Standard operating procedures, setting out relevant functions and responsibilities, had also been prepared and were currently at the final stages of review and approval. 65. In its above-mentioned report, the Board of Auditors expressed concern about the high level of unliquidated obligations in certain missions. At UNAMID, in particular, the Board noted that large amounts of unliquidated obligations ($80.68 million, or 34.7 per cent of the Operation's total unliquidated obligations) had been created on 30 June 2010, the last day of the financial year, which may indicate inadequate in-year budget management (see A/65/5 (Vol. II), para. 30). The Board also referred to the high incidence of cancellation of unliquidated obligations, noting that at UNAMID, prior-period obligations amounting to $92.24 million were cancelled during 2009/10, representing 49.1 per cent of the total amount of $187.7 million cancelled across all active peacekeeping missions (see A/65/5 (Vol. II), para. 32). In this connection, the Advisory Committee recalls the provisions of General Assembly resolution 64/269, in which the Assembly noted with concern the significant amount of prior-period obligations cancelled by several missions and reiterated its request that the Secretary-General improve control over obligations. The Advisory Committee urges UNAMID to take the measures necessary to comply with the Board's recommendations relating to unliquidated obligations and contracts management. V. Conclusion 66. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNAMID for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010 are set out in paragraph 94 of the performance report (A/65/631).

Total expenditure Unencumbered balance Expenditure Total expenditure, including projected Estimated unencumbered balance as at 30 June 2011 Variance (percentage) Reasons for variance Military and police personnel The unutilized balance is attributable to the non-deployment of contingent-owned equipment for 3 military helicopter units and 1 military surveillance unit The unutilized balance is attributable to the slower than anticipated deployment of United Nations police officers, offset in part by additional requirements for the payment of the full amount of mission subsistence allowance to all deployed officers The unutilized balance is attributable to the delayed deployment of contingent-owned equipment Subtotal Civilian personnel The unutilized balance is attributable to lower than anticipated requirements for international staff salaries and related costs The unutilized balance is attributable to a lower exchange rate between the local currency and the United States dollar The unutilized balance is attributable to lower than planned requirements for allowances Operational costs Government-provided personnel Civilian electoral observers Consultants The additional expenditures are attributable to unbudgeted consultancies (peace process, human rights, HIV/AIDS, water and environment, and evaluation of medical facilities) owing to the lack of in-house capabilities The additional expenditures are attributable to the support provided to the Joint Mediation Support Team for the Doha peace process and to within-mission travel requirements related to military and police patrols, interaction with the local population to promote political dialogue, and team site visits The additional expenditures are attributable to delays in the completion of the multi-year construction projects, resulting in the carrying over into 2010/11 of some projects that should have been completed in 2009/10 Ground transportation Air transportation The unutilized balance is attributable to the non-deployment of 3 fixed-wing and 4 rotary-wing aircraft Naval transportation Information technology Medical Special equipment Other supplies, services and equipment
