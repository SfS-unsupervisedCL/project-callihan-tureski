(Signed) Marjatta RASI Permanent Representative English Page Annex [Original: English and French] Statement on the decision of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly on East Timor issued on 21 October 1999 by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union The European Union (EU) welcomes the decision of the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly on 19 October 1999 to declare as void the 1978 decree incorporating East Timor to Indonesia. This decision is an important step in the United Nations-led process to pursue arrangements for a peaceful and orderly transfer of authority in East Timor to the United Nations. The EU, together with the international community, looks forward to the smooth and peaceful transition of East Timor to full independence, and trusts that the Government of Indonesia will fully cooperate to achieve this aim. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, the associated countries Cyprus and Malta, and the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area align themselves with this declaration.
