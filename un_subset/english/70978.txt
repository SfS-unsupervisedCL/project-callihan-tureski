United Nations A/HRC/27/19 General Assembly Distr.: General 25 June 2014 Original: English Human Rights Council Twenty-seventh session Agenda item 2 Annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General Follow-up review of the management and administration of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Report of the Joint Inspection Unit Note by the Secretariat 1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 22/2, requested the Joint Inspection Unit to undertake a comprehensive follow-up review of the management and administration of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in particular with regard to its impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, and to submit a report thereon and containing concrete proposals for the implementation of resolution 22/2 to the Council at its twenty-seventh session. 2. The Joint Inspection Unit has informed the Secretariat that the review mandated by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 22/2 has been included in its programme of work for 2014, and is already well under way. It has also informed the Secretariat, however, that, given its own procedural requirements, it would not be feasible for the Unit to submit the results of the review to the Council at its twenty-seventh session, and that it will do so at the twenty-eighth. It has therefore requested the Secretariat to bring these circumstances to the attention of the Council. The President of the Council and the Office of the High Commissioner were informed thereof earlier in 2014.
