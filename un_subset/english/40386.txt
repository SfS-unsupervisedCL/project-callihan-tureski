Programme support Annex Outputs produced in 2006-2007 not to be carried out in the biennium 2008-2009 21.1 The overall orientation of programme 18 is to foster comprehensive, equitable, integrated and sustainable development and economic and social cooperation in the region and to maintain and strengthen economic relations between the member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) and other countries of the world. ESCWA is responsible for the implementation of the programme. 21.2 Policy direction for the programme is provided in Economic and Social Council resolutions 1818 (LV) of 9 August 1973 and 1985/69 of 26 July 1985, establishing ESCWA and amending the terms of reference to underscore the social functions of the Commission. Further direction is provided in ESCWA resolution 220 (XX) of 27 May 1999, by which the ESCWA member countries adopted the Beirut Declaration, which envisioned an enhanced role for the Commission at the regional level; and, by the recommendation of the Commission at its twenty-first session (May 2001) that activities focus on a limited number of priorities, on Arab regional integration and on the study of mechanisms that would activate such integration. The internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and international agreements since 1992, dealing with such matters as trade, sustainable development, social development, finance, and information and communication technologies, provide further policy direction to the programme. 21.3 Political instability, foreign occupation and the lack of adequate structural reforms influence economic performance in the countries of the region. While recent hikes in international energy prices have brought a surge of economic boom in most energy exporting countries of the region, other countries continue to face difficulties in mobilizing domestic and foreign direct investment. The region is in need of economic and social policies that ensure social justice and equitable distribution of wealth. The prevalence of technology in the region, especially information and communication technologies -- a powerful enabler of development -- remains below the international average. 21.4 Furthermore, the region has the second highest population growth in the world, following Africa, creating increasing demand for food, water and energy, and adequate infrastructure to provide basic shelter, education, health care and other social services and productive employment opportunities. This requires the countries of the region to coordinate efforts and mobilize more resources for the provision of regional public goods, including water management, environmental sustainability, the social safety net and coordination and harmonization in trade policies and procedures, transport infrastructure and conflict resolution and peacebuilding. 21.5 The countries of the region also continue to experience some of the highest unemployment rates in the world, especially among the youth. Migration, both towards and away from ESCWA countries, is a regional issue that needs to be addressed within the framework of international human rights treaties, taking into account regional economic considerations. Women's equal rights to and opportunity for economic and political participation should be further encouraged, although the region achieved general success in making the secondary and tertiary education systems far more accessible to both sexes equally. Among the vulnerable groups, those who suffer most live in the least developed and conflict-stricken countries of the region. 21.6 There persists a strong need to improve the institutional capacity to produce timely, reliable and comparable statistics for policy and programme formulation and for monitoring the progress made towards the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. Regular monitoring of the effects of foreign occupation on economic and social development in the region is increasingly becoming important. 21.7 For the biennium 2008-2009, ESCWA will pursue the programme objective by promoting economic and social integration among its member countries at the subregional and regional levels and fostering solidarity in the international political arena and global economy. Such regional integration between member countries could be scaled up to cover the Arab region through strategic partnerships with subregional and regional organizations, especially the League of Arab States (LAS) and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The programme will focus on the four regional priority areas: (a) managing water and energy; (b) promoting integrated social policies; (c) stimulating economic development and integration in the increasingly globalizing world; and (d) accelerating the introduction and development of technology, especially information and communications technology. Throughout the programme, the emphasis will be placed on the effective participation and involvement of women and their advancement, special consideration for the people living in conflict-stricken countries and statistical capacity development. Attention should be focused on Arab regional integration and the study of mechanisms that would activate this integration. 21.8 ESCWA will carry out analytical and normative work, building on its accumulated knowledge and multidisciplinary expertise, which will be supported by the provision of technical cooperation. It will also facilitate multilateral dialogue, knowledge-sharing and networking on the outcome of the Commission's work and the national, regional and global development issues. In addition, ESCWA will provide a regional platform for the member countries to formulate and implement regional initiatives, agreements and programmes. 21.9 It is expected that regional support provided by ESCWA will contribute towards: (a) increased national capacity to formulate and implement economic and social policies and programmes that are pro-poor and inclusive, and to tackle transboundary issues; (b) provision of joint responses to address multifaceted problems encountered by the countries in the region through the coordinated efforts and consolidated resources of the United Nations entities; (c) enhanced work of the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions for the review and assessment of progress made in implementing the outcomes of United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields; and (d) increased knowledge-sharing and South-South cooperation among the countries in the region and with countries in other regions, thereby promoting regional and interregional cooperation. 21.10 The programme will be harmonized through regular interaction with the other entities of the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs and the entities of the United Nations Development Group. The latter will be achieved through the Regional Coordination Group, which is led by ESCWA. ESCWA will enhance its collaboration with the subregional office for North Africa of the Economic Commission for Africa to ensure synergies in thematic and operational work and to bring its expertise to the countries in the North African subregion, which share common language and cultural values. 21.11 For the period 2008-2009, subprogrammes 3 and 4 are proposed to be merged into one subprogramme. An internal review carried out in December 2005 demonstrated that many mandates were common to both subprogrammes. Hence, issues of economic growth and development and financing for development issues, including the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, which have been dealt with by two subprogrammes in the past few years, are proposed to become the responsibility of subprogramme 3, Economic development and integration, to complement and increase synergy. Consolidating the two subprogrammes will also facilitate the strategic repositioning of economic analysis work with a view to making it more objective-oriented, that is, geared to achieving sustained high growth, employment creation and/or poverty alleviation, on the one hand, and creating space for operationalizing findings, conclusions and recommendations of studies and meetings into policy advice and capacity development, on the other. 21.12 Furthermore, a new subprogramme 7 is proposed on conflict mitigation and development that will address the impact of the persistent instability and conflict on economic and social development in Western Asia, which affects not only the countries concerned but also neighbouring countries and the region as a whole. The subprogramme aims to give concrete expression to the interlinkages between peace and security, development and human rights, in accordance with the 2005 World Summit Outcome and relevant ESCWA resolutions. The subprogramme focuses on pursuing sustainable development goals in a context of tension and insecurity to address the increasing poverty levels and the deteriorating quality of life in the afflicted areas. It will also increase understanding of the causes of conflict and instability to enable the countries to take appropriate measures to reduce their vulnerability, strengthen advocacy and capacity-building on issues of good governance and promote the replication of good practices. 21.13 The overall resources proposed under this section amount to $56,809,900, reflecting a resource growth of $485,300, or 0.9 per cent, compared with the revised appropriation for the biennium 2006-2007. The increase is the result of a range of adjustments in the activities and related resources proposed for this section, as reflected in table 21.3 below, which may be summarized as follows: (a) The decrease of $12,300 for policymaking organs is due to reduced requirements for interpretation services; (b) The increase of $49,300 under executive direction and management is the net result of: (i) proposed reclassification of the post of the Secretary of the Commission from P-5 to D-1 level as a result of merging the functions of the Special Assistant to the Executive Secretary and the Secretary of the Commission ($44,400); and (ii) additional non-post requirements ($4,900); (c) The increase of $1,010,200 under the programme of work is the net result of: (i) an increase of $1,015,900 under posts owing to the redeployment of three posts (1 P-5 and 1 Local level to subprogramme 2 and 1 Local level to subprogramme 4) from programme support ($572,300) and the delayed impact of the establishment of four posts (1 P-2 in subprogramme 1, 1 P-2 and 1 P-3 in subprogramme 3, and 1 P-3 in subprogramme 6) in the biennium 20062007 ($443,600); and (ii) a marginal decrease under non-post requirements ($5,700); (d) The decrease of $561,900 under programme support is the net result of: (i) a decrease as a result of the outward redeployment of three posts to the subprogrammes as outlined above ($572,300); and (ii) an increase of $10,400 under non-post resources, as a result of additional requirements for the ESCWA contribution to the joint medical services unit, partially offset by reduced requirements under contractual services and supplies. 21.14 During the biennium 2008-2009, expected extrabudgetary resources, amounting to $9,064,100, would be utilized to supplement resources from the regular budget to finance activities aimed at national capacity-building, including advisory service missions, training workshops and field projects. 21.15 The issue of publications as a part of the programme of work has been reviewed in the context of each subprogramme. It is anticipated that recurrent and non-recurrent publications will be issued as summarized below and as described in the output information for each subprogramme. Table 21.1 Summary of publications Publications actual estimate Recurrent Non-recurrent Total 21.16 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269 of 23 December 2003, resources identified for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation would amount to $479,400, financed from the programme budget and reflected under subprogrammes 1 to 7. 21.17 It would be recalled that in his note to the General Assembly (A/61/758), the Secretary-General submitted his comments on the recommendations contained in the report of the Redesign Panel on the United Nations system of administration of justice (A/61/205), and identified the time and resources needed to implement the Panel's recommendations. The note is currently under consideration by the General Assembly in its resumed sixty-first session. Accordingly, the proposed resource redeployments and growth sought in the note (A/61/758) have not been incorporated under the present budget section. Following consideration, decisions of the General Assembly on these resource proposals would be incorporated in the budget appropriation at the time of adoption of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 in December 2007. 21.18 The estimated percentage distribution of resources under this section would be as shown in table 21.2 below.

The Commission, which reports to the Economic and Social Council, provides overall direction to the work of the secretariat. It meets once biennially for five working days, normally at its headquarters. As mandated by resolution 223 (XX) which was adopted on 27 May 1999 at the twentieth session of the Commission, the Preparatory Committee will meet prior to the plenary of the Commission to consider programmatic agenda items. Consequently, the twenty-fifth session will be convened in 2008, with a session comprising the Preparatory Committee Segment (3 days in 2008), followed by the Ministerial Plenary Segment (2 days in 2008). 21.20 The Commission has seven specialized subsidiary intergovernmental committees, six of them meet biennially and one meets annually. During the biennium 2008-2009, the sequence and dates of their sessions will be as follows: (a) the seventh session of the Committee on Energy (subprogramme 1) (2 days in 2008); (b) the eighth session of the Committee on Water Resources (subprogramme 1) (3 days in 2009); (c) the seventh session of the Committee on Social Development (subprogramme 2) (3 days in 2009); (d) the ninth and tenth sessions of the Committee on Transport (subprogramme 3) (3 days in 2008 and 3 days in 2009); (e) the sixth session of the Technical Committee on Liberalization of Foreign Trade and Economic Globalization in the Countries of the ESCWA Region (subprogramme 3) (2 days in 2009); (f) the eighth session of the Statistical Committee (subprogramme 5) (3 days in 2008); and (g) the fourth session Committee on Women (subprogramme 6) (3 days in 2008). 21.21 At its twenty-fourth session, the Commission decided to establish a Technical Committee with the aim of enhancing interaction and close consultation between the members of the Commission and its secretariat on substantive development issues. The sessions of the Technical Committee shall be held every six months (2 days twice in 2008 and 2 days twice in 2009). 21.22 The Advisory Committee of Ambassadors meets quarterly to ensure the continued dialogue between the secretariat and member States. It comprises heads of diplomatic missions in the host country of the Commission, as well as a high-level representative of the host country. The Advisory Committee plays a consultative role and functions as a principal means of communication between member States and the ESCWA secretariat and among member States themselves on important matters requiring attention during the period between the biennial sessions of the Commission (1 day 4 times in 2008 and 1 day 4 times in 2009). Table 21.5 Resource requirements: policymaking organs Resources (thousands of United States dollars) Posts (before recosting) Non-post 21.23 A provision of $126,100, reflecting a decrease of $12,300, is required under: (a) temporary assistance for meetings to provide interpretation and translation services; and (b) general temporary assistance during the session of the Commission, that of the Preparatory Committee, as well as the sessions of its seven subsidiary intergovernmental committees. The reduced requirement is mainly due to lower requirements for interpretation services. Resource requirements (before recosting): $3,414,700 21.24 Executive direction and management comprises the Office of the Executive Secretary and the ESCWA United Nations Information Services. 21.25 The Office of the Executive Secretary provides overall direction and integrated management, programme oversight, planning and coordination, as well as policy guidelines to the substantive divisions, the technical cooperation programme and other support services. It ensures that ESCWA plays an effective role in the economic and social development of the region, and that issues of global importance are translated into regional action as mandated by member States. The Office also facilitates the articulation of the collective concerns of member countries by incorporating them into the global agenda. Moreover, the Office maintains effective and regular contact with representatives of member States, to exchange views on substantive issues of mutual concern, with the Executive Office of the Secretary-General and with the regional commissions coordination office in New York. It also ensures: (a) more effective collaboration and coordination between ESCWA and the rest of the United Nations Secretariat, specialized agencies, funds and programmes, as well as international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations; (b) proper implementation of the work programme of ESCWA as mandated by the General Assembly; and (c) the realization of United Nations system-wide policies and mandates, as well as specific recommendations. 21.26 In addition, the Office of the Executive Secretary is directly involved in the functioning and servicing of the intergovernmental machinery of the Commission, including its biennial session and its subsidiary bodies, the ESCWA Advisory Committee of Ambassadors and the ESCWA Technical Committee. Furthermore, the Office is responsible for: (a) overseeing the coordination of the activities of the secretariat of the United Nations Regional Coordination Group; and (b) ensuring that expert group meetings, workshops and other meetings organized by the divisions in ESCWA contribute to the attainment of overall policy orientation. 21.27 The Office of the Executive Secretary also gives overall direction to services rendered by the ESCWA United Nations Information Services, whose core functions are to disseminate public information on the work of ESCWA throughout the region and to provide information services to the Office and the Divisions of ESCWA. The activities of the ESCWA United Nations Information Services aim at increasing public awareness and understanding of the work conducted by the United Nations, in general, and ESCWA, in particular, and mobilizing public support for the increased role of ESCWA in the economic and social development of the region. These activities will include: disseminating information on the activities carried out by the secretariat to the media; issuing press releases, bulletins, information kits, and other information material such as booklets, newsletters, pamphlets and brochures to cover general and special events; producing quality electronic, audio and video material; launching media campaigns; organizing interviews, press conferences, round-table discussions; participating in major local, regional or international exhibitions; and preparing lectures and briefings on the activities of the United Nations.

Table 21.7 Resource requirements: executive direction and management Post 21.29 The amount of $3,207,300 under posts, reflecting an increase of $44,400, provides for the funding of the 16 posts as indicated in the above table. The additional requirement relates to the proposed reclassification of the current post of the Secretary of the Commission from P-5 to D-1 level. The proposal reflects the merger of the functions of the Special Assistant to the Executive Secretary (P4) with those of the Secretary of the Commission (P-5), in line with other regional commissions. The main functions of the new post, Secretary of the Commission/Chief of staff (D1), would include: (a) planning and servicing the intergovernmental sessions; (b) maintaining relations with member States; (c) leading the gradual introduction, formulation and implementation of an ESCWA knowledge management policy and strategy; and (d) performing the entire array of substantive, administrative and managerial functions previously performed by the Special Assistant. 21.30 The report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) on the inspection of the programme and administrative management of ESCWA (A/61/61) included a recommendation (SP-04-003-014) that a dedicated post of knowledge manager should be established with an incumbent being a recognized expert in that area and provided with all necessary authority and resources to implement the action plan. With the merger of the functions of the post of Special Assistant with that of the Secretary of the Commission as outlined above, it is proposed that the P4 post (formerly of the Special Assistant) be used for the functions of Economic Affairs Officer in order to implement the OIOS recommendation. The main functions of the post would be to develop, implement, monitor and continuously improve a knowledge management policy and strategy for ESCWA. 21.31 The related non-post requirements of $207,400, reflecting an increase of $4,900, include provisions for: (a) general temporary assistance and overtime which would provide for the preparation and servicing of the twenty-fifth session of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies; (b) consultants to undertake studies in areas that do not fall within the expertise of the substantive divisions in connection with the preparation of the ESCWA annual report; (c) two annual think tank meetings which would serve as a platform for the exchange of views among experts on the salient priority issues of the region; and (d) travel requirements of the Office of the Executive Secretary and the information services.

Table 21.10 Resource requirements: subprogramme 1 21.35 The amount of $5,330,900 under posts, reflecting a decrease of $224,000, would provide for the continued funding of 24 posts. The net decrease of $224,000 relates to the outward redeployment of one P-4 post ($320,800) to subprogramme 6, Advancement of women, partially offset by increased requirements related to the delayed impact of one P-2 post established in the biennium 2006-2007 ($96,800). For the biennium 2008-2009, the subprogramme objective aims to improve the sustainable management and use of natural resources in the region, with particular emphasis on water, energy, environmental protection and the production sectors through the coordination of the Executive Committee of Economic and Social Affairs pursuant to the 2005 World Summit Outcome. With the increased cooperation with the UNEP Regional Office in Western Asia, the outward redeployment would not adversely impact the work of the subprogramme. 21.36 The related non-post requirements of $316,700, reflecting an increase of $27,500, would be required for other personnel costs, consultants, expert group meetings and travel of staff. The additional requirements are mainly due to the increase in the number of planned expert group meetings from five in the biennium 2006-2007 to six in the biennium 2008-2009. 21.37 Extrabudgetary resources of $976,800 would be utilized for activities aimed at national capacity-building on renewable energy services for poverty alleviation to the rural areas, and promoting the adoption and application on energy efficiency measures in the ESCWA region. Subprogramme 2 Integrated social policies Resource requirements (before recosting): $5,151,200 21.38 The subprogramme is under the responsibility of the Social Development Division. The programme of work has been formulated by drawing upon subprogramme 2 of programme 18 of the biennial programme plan for the period 2008-2009.

Table 21.12 Resource requirements: subprogramme 2 21.41 The amount of $4,851,400 under posts, reflecting an increase of $477,200, would provide for the funding of 22 posts. The increase of $477,200 relates to the inward redeployment of one P-5 and one local level posts from programme support. The 2005 World Summit Outcome recognized the multidimensional aspects of international migration and development in order to identify appropriate ways and means to maximize their development benefits and minimize their negative impacts and to ensure respect for and protection of the human rights of migrants, migrant workers and members of their families. The proposed inward redeployment would strengthen the work of the subprogramme in addressing the issues related to migration, rural and urban migration, and intra/inter-regional migration and their interlinkage with poverty, which will also feed into the development of integrated social development policies that aims to achieve social equity, poverty reduction and sustainable population. 21.42 The requirements for non-post resources in the amount of $299,800, reflecting an increase of $11,100, would provide for other personnel costs, consultants, expert group meetings and travel of staff. The increase is attributable mainly to the additional requirements under general temporary assistance to promote and disseminate information on the work of the subprogramme electronically, and advocate for the concept of integrated social policies, mainly through preparing information kits and technical material, and upgrading the POPIN website and the Social Development Network. 21.43 Extrabudgetary resources of $370,200 would be used to enhance the capacities of member countries in the adoption of an integrated and participatory approach for social policy formulation and implementation, prioritization of social policy concerns in national development strategies, and collection of social development indicators.

Table 21.14 Resource requirements: subprogramme 3 21.47 The amount of $6,315,000 under posts, reflecting a decrease of $2,567,600, would provide for the continued funding of 29 posts. The net decrease of $2,567,600 relates to the outward redeployment of 11 posts (1 P-5 to subprogramme 4; 1 D-1 and 1 P-2 to subprogramme 5; and 1 P-5, 2 P-4, 1 P3, 1 P-2 and 3 Local level to the newly established subprogramme 7) ($2,789,400), partially offset by increased requirements related to the delayed impact of one P-3 and one P-2 posts established in the biennium 2006-2007 ($221,800). The subprogramme is newly created as the result of merging the two existing subprogrammes (subprogramme 3, Economic analysis and forecasting for regional development, and subprogramme 4, Regional integration and responding to globalization) in the biennium 2006-2007. The proposed outward redeployment is the net result of the rationalization of the work, focusing on the regional monitoring of the Millennium Development Goals, the follow-up to the Monterrey Consensus on financing for development, the Doha Development Agenda and the development of regional integrated transport system. 21.48 The requirements for non-post resources in the amount of $429,600, reflecting a decrease of $171,800, would be required for other personnel related costs, consultants, expert group meetings and travel of staff. The reduced requirements reflect the reallocation of resources to other subprogrammes as a result of the merger. 21.49 Extrabudgetary resources of $559,200 would contribute to promoting subregional growth-oriented economic and trade policies towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals in the ESCWA region. Subprogramme 4 Information and communication technology for regional integration Resource requirements (before recosting): $3,670,100 21.50 The subprogramme is under the responsibility of the Information and Communication Technology Division. The programme of work has been formulated by drawing upon subprogramme 4 of programme 18 of the biennial programme plan for the period 2008-2009.

Table 21.16 Resource requirements: subprogramme 4 21.53 The amount of $3,455,000 under posts, reflecting an increase of $477,200, would provide for the funding of 15 posts. The increase of $477,200 relates to the inward redeployment of two posts (1 P-5 from subprogramme 3 and 1 Local level from programme support). The proposed inward redeployment would strengthen the work pertaining to ICT applications, especially the provision of e-services in Arabic, targeting socio-economic development, more specifically e-government and digital Arabic content. The work is important in bridging the widening digital divide between Gulf (major energy producing countries) and other member countries (least developed countries and countries emerging from conflict) and between cities and rural areas. 21.54 The requirements under non-post resources of $215,100, reflecting a decrease of $19,700, would provide for other personnel-related costs, consultants, expert group meetings and travel of staff. The decrease relates to the overall requirements under expert group meetings which is due mainly to a reduced number of participants. 21.55 Extrabudgetary resources in the amount of $1,884,900 would enable member countries to harness their development potential in building a knowledge-based society, through increasing the implementation of the Regional Plan of Action for Building the Information Society, particularly in relation to the information and communications technology sector, and supporting the provision of e-services in Arabic aimed at furthering socio-economic development. Subprogramme 5 Statistics for evidence-based policymaking Resource requirement (before recosting): $3,406,400 21.56 The subprogramme is under the responsibility of the Statistics Division.

Table 21.18 Resource requirements: subprogramme 5 21.59 The amount of $3,229,300 under posts, reflecting an increase of $630,600, provides for the funding of 15 posts. The increase relates to the inward redeployment of two posts (1 D-1 and 1 P2) from subprogramme 3, which would strengthen the secretariat's capacity in assisting the member countries to improve their national institutional framework for official statistics. This is also in compliance with the OIOS recommendation (SP-04-003-002), in which ESCWA has been requested to reconstitute a full fledged Statistical Division to respond to the expressed needs of the member countries (see A/61/61). 21.60 The requirements under non-post resources of $177,100, reflecting an increase of $16,200, would provide for other personnel related costs, consultants, expert group meetings and travel of staff.

Table 21.20 Resource requirements: subprogramme 6 21.65 The amount of $2,135,400 under posts, reflecting an increase of $445,800, would provide for funding of 10 posts. The increased requirements relate to the inward redeployment of one P-4 post from subprogramme 1 ($320,800) and the delayed impact of a P-3 post established in the biennium 2006-2007 ($125,000). The proposed inward redeployment aims to strengthen the secretariat capacity to respond to the new mandate contained in paragraph 2 of ESCWA resolution 278 (XXIV) of 11 May 2006, in which the secretariat is requested to examine the situation of women in the ESCWA member countries that suffer from occupation, war and conflict, and build their capacities in the field of conflict resolution and peacebuilding. 21.66 The requirements under non-post resources of $153,000, reflecting an increase of $34,900, would provide for other personnel related costs, consultants, expert group meetings and travel of staff. The increase is mainly related to additional requirements under consultants to respond to mandates emanating from the 2005 World Summit Outcome, and expert group meetings owing to the increase in the number of expert group meetings from two in the biennium 2006-2007 to four in the biennium 2008-2009. 21.67 Extrabudgetary resources of $518,700 would be used for technical cooperation activities such as advisory services and workshops, to strengthen the capacity of government officials, nongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations in the priority areas of the region identified by the Arab Regional Conference Ten Years after Beijing: Call for Peace. Subprogramme 7 Conflict mitigation and development Resource requirement (before recosting): $1,872,800 21.68 The subprogramme is under the responsibility of the Conflict Mitigation and Development Section. The programme of work has been formulated by drawing upon subprogramme 7 of programme 18 of the biennial programme plan for the period 2008-2009. Table 21.21 Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures Objective of the Organization: To reduce the impact of conflict and instability on socio-economic and political development in Western Asia.

Table 21.23 Summary of resource requirements 21.77 The amount of $17,831,700 under posts, reflecting a decrease of $572,300, provides for the continued funding of 116 posts. The net decrease of $572,300 results from the outward redeployment of two posts (1 P-5 and 1 Local level) to subprogramme 2 and one Local level post to subprogramme 5. The proposed redeployments is the result of the continuous rationalization of the work processes in the Administrative Services Division with the aim of shifting resources to the substantive areas in order to strengthen them. 21.78 Requirements under non-post resources of $6,656,300, reflecting an increase of $10,400, include inter alia, (a) other personnel related costs; (b) consultants to provide for specialized legal expertise, and for strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems; (c) travel of staff; (d) general operating expenses; and (e) contribution to the ESCWA Joint Medical Services Unit. 21.79 Extrabudgetary resources of $455,600 would provide for services in support of technical cooperation activities. Table 21.24 Summary of follow-up action taken to implement the relevant recommendations of the oversight bodies Brief description of the recommendation Action taken to implement the recommendation Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/60/7 and Corr.1) The Advisory Committee requests that ESCWA report on progress made in the area of fund-raising and extrabudgetary resources in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 (para. V.78). ESCWA established a donor database for fund-raising and also developed a system to monitor donor contacts, both of which are now posted on the Intranet. The substantive staffs are requested to share information with others on their latest contacts with potential donors. In 2006, the secretariat circulated a pamphlet on the ESCWA Trust Fund at the twenty-fourth session of the Commission with a view to encourage members to contribute to it. This approach will continue for 2007. In 2007, ESCWA will further operationalize the partnership development strategy and resource mobilization plan. Each new project proposal will be required to include funding a strategy and dedicated follow up with potential donor(s). The first meeting of the technical cooperation focal points of the ESCWA member countries is scheduled to take place in May 2007. Arrangements for the cost-sharing of medical services should be worked out in a transparent manner, a priori (para. V.79). A cost-sharing mechanism has been established at ESCWA including the medical services. Memorandums of understanding have been issued and signed by ESCWA and its counterparts. It is expected that the Medical Services Unit would be fully operational by mid-2007. Board of Auditors (A/61/5, vol. II, chap. II) The Board recommended that ESCWA obtain the necessary financial information from vendors, in conformity with section 7.5 of the United Nations Procurement Manual (para. 536). The Procurement Unit will continue to obtain the necessary financial information from vendors. Each buyer is responsible to have such documents available in the vendor file (in accordance with the Procurement Manual) prior to awarding contracts. The Board recommended that ESCWA evaluate the reasons for the delays in the procurement process which result in a lengthy lead time and take corrective action to prevent its recurrence (para. 561). ESCWA shall ensure that requisitioners consolidate their requirements and improve submission of clear specification. This would ensure reduction in lead time between the date of receipt of the requisition by the Procurement Unit and the date that the goods/services are inspected. The Board reiterated its recommendation that the Administration fill vacant posts in a timely manner (para. 643). The Human Resources Management Section continues and closely monitors and follows up on all prevailing recruitment cases. The Board recommended that ESCWA appoint staff at levels in line with the job requirements and in accordance with the approved staffing table, and expedite the ongoing post classification review to ensure that post levels are aligned with the respective job requirements and staffing needs (para. 649). Several of the cases have already been resolved in the context of the implementation of the classification review which is nearing completion. Office of Internal Oversight Services (A/61/61) ESCWA should determine which current "divisional teams" must be re-established as stable organizational units and which ones should continue as teams. Multidisciplinary, interdivisional teams should complement the stable organizational structure by being set up for achieving concrete non-recurrent goals by specific deadlines. Subprogramme managers should be empowered to manage both stable structural units and multidisciplinary teams within their purview (SP-04-003-001) (para. 50). Within the context of the programme budget exercises for 2006-2007 and 2008-2009, the subprogramme theme and team structures of ESCWA were carefully examined and realigned to strengthen one-to-one congruence. In light of the ongoing United Nations reform and its impact on the organizational structure and resource allocations, ESCWA is committed to continue the implementation of this recommendation. Subprogramme managers are empowered to manage their teams and to promote interdivisional activities through regular senior management consultations. The internal review should be completed without delay. A revitalized Statistics Division, responsible for all outputs and resources of statistics subprogramme, should be re-established without further delay. It should be linked through effective consultative mechanisms and collaborative arrangements with other ESCWA divisions, the Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and regional and national counterparts (SP-04-003-002) (para. 52). The internal review was completed. In the proposed programme budget for 2008-2009, the reconstitution of a full fledged Statistics Division and the necessary redeployments are proposed to manage subprogramme 5. ESCWA will continue to monitor the outcome of the implementation of this recommendation, bearing in mind that the Statistics Division is required to meet the needs of both external clients (national statistical offices and other producers of statistics) and internal clients (substantive Divisions in the secretariat). ESCWA should revise the terms of reference of its Publications Committee reflecting the relevant best practices and ensuring the clear delineation of responsibilities between the Committee, the substantive Divisions and the top management of ESCWA (SP-04-003-003) (para. 54). The terms of reference were revised through close consultation within all organizational units in the ESCWA secretariat as well as with other regional commissions. To the extent possible, the responsibilities between the Committee, the substantive Divisions and the top management of ESCWA have been delineated. The Publications Committee will provide a forum that promotes close interaction among all organizational units and proposes collective advice to the Management on required action. ESCWA should prepare a plan of action for fully implementing all envisaged elements of Total Quality System (SP-04-003-004) (para. 56). According to the plan of action, ESCWA has institutionalized a number of quality assurance mechanisms (the development of a standardized annual divisional workplan; the implementation of the quarterly programme budget performance assessment; and the implementation of the monthly monitoring of publications programme; the development of in-house training on key subjects aimed at quality improvement). The Project Review Committee of ESCWA should deal with all technical cooperation projects irrespective of their source of funding. The Committee should prepare the compendium of best practices in fund-raising, project approval, appraisal and evaluation, and optimizing the geographical focus of technical cooperation as applied in ESCWA, as well as relevant guidelines and templates to be used in the Committee's work. The proceedings of the Committee, along with comprehensive information on advisory services planned and delivered, should be available on the Intranet and an electronic bulletin board should be set up to make information on the planning and implementation of all technical cooperation activities widely accessible and supportive to multidisciplinary programming and cooperation (SP-04-003-005) (para. 57). The existing ESCWA Trust Funds Committee became ESCWA Project Review Committee to assume the full functions required. ESCWA established a project planning and management cycle and implemented an outreach programme and a series of training of technical cooperation focal points in organizational units within ESCWA. All relevant forms and guidelines are made available and regularly updated on the Intranet, so that the staff-at-large have direct access to them. Furthermore, the quarterly project monitoring report is issued to keep the Management and the substantive offices informed of the latest implementation status of all technical cooperation projects. ESCWA should enhance the impact of training on programme performance through: (a) Determining, in participatory manner, the priorities and topics of training on the basis of programme priorities and related needs in the adjustment of staff skills and making training plans available to all staff; (b) Promoting group training and raising its share to at least 30 per cent of all training funds; (c) Establishing clear guidelines on obtaining external training and widely disseminating them. (SP-04-003-006) (para. 58). All funds related to training allocated have been applied. Status as at December 2006: Substantive skills upgrading: 98 staff received training; 56 per cent of funds used for individual training; and 44 per cent for group training. Information technology training: 23 staff were trained 51 per cent of funds spent on individual training and 49 per cent on group training The training plan was reviewed in October on return of ESCWA staff from evacuation. All programme managers were requested to review their training requests and indicate priorities. (a) ESCWA should initiate the in-depth review, jointly with all members of the Regional Coordination Group, of the role, methods of work and support resources of the Group aimed at transforming it into a robust tool for regional coordination, creating a reliable mechanism for implementing its recommendations and ensuring effective staff support to its revitalized role (para. 59). (a) The Third Meeting of Chiefs of Programme Planning of Regional Commissions (Beirut, September 2005) reviewed the role of regional coordination meetings, including national-regional linkages. At the eleventh meeting (Beirut, June 2006), the Group initiated the process of an in-depth review of the role, methods of work and support resources of the Group. In light of the ongoing United Nations reform and its impact on the role, methods of work and financial aspects of the Group, ESCWA is committed to continue the implementation of this recommendation, taking into consideration the outcome of the General Assembly decision on the United Nations reform, including Economic and Social Council reform. (b) The Regional Coordination Group page on ESCWA website should be revamped and other relevant electronic tools employed to support continuous collaboration between members of the Group in implementing its recommendations and identifying agenda items for forthcoming meetings (SP-04-003-007) (para. 59). (b) Lack of manpower resources and other emerging priority work in relation to United Nations reform (including the mandate review inputs, etc.) did not allow to take the necessary action. At the twelfth meeting in 2007, the Group will address this issue, including the issue of joint financing. ESCWA should develop without delay a longer-term programme of thematic and operational cooperation with the Subregional Office for North Africa of ECA (Economic Commission for Africa), which would realize their synergies and comparative advantages (SP-04-003-008) (para. 60). Through the review of the ECA Business Plan for 2007-2009 and ESCWA programme of work for 2007-2009, several programme areas were identified for possible areas of cooperation. In February 2007, the Executive Secretaries of ECA and ESCWA held consultation on this issue in New York. As a result, the first joint project proposal on integrated social policies is now under consideration to respond to the request from the Sudan, building on ESCWA's experience gained through the implementation of capacity building projects in Bahrain and Egypt. This will be followed up by a tripartite meeting in Rabat among the programme planning offices of ECA headquarters and ESCWA as well as the North African subregion in late May 2007. ESCWA should proactively engage the UNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States in developing a comprehensive and specific framework of longer-term cooperation in accordance with the strengthening of the regional dimensions of operational activities envisaged by the Secretary-General. Such framework should also extend to all regional offices of the United Nations system and United Nations country teams. It should use web-based knowledge management regional networks as the major resource for more effective collaboration (SP-04-003-009) (para. 62). The dates of the eleventh meeting of the Regional Coordination Group were determined to ensure the participation of the new Director of the Regional Bureau of Arab States of UNDP (June 2006). ESCWA and UNDP identified the following three programme areas for possible cooperation: poverty alleviation; trade and human development; and gender. Within the context of United Nations reform, the Executive Secretaries of the regional commissions and the UNDP Administrator agreed to prepare an umbrella memorandum of understanding between the regional commissions and UNDP, which will set a framework for promoting long-term cooperation between the regional commissions and the relevant UNDP regional bureau. The use of web-based knowledge management regional networks will also be addressed within the new framework. ESCWA should develop its information technology strategy and strategic plan for implementation based on the United Nations information and communication technology strategy standards and guidance. Minutes of the Information and Communication Technology Committee meetings should be made available on the Intranet (SP-04-003-010) (para. 64). The Information and Communication Technology Committee has developed a preliminary ICT strategy based on the United Nations ICT strategy, with the participation of substantive divisions/units in ESCWA. The war and subsequent relocation and evacuation of ESCWA staff during the summer, has disrupted the continuation of the work. The Committee has resumed working on the strategy and is expected to introduce the strategy to the Cabinet for review and discussion early next year. The Committee minutes are in the process of being made available on the Intranet. The function of the information master needs to be established with clear terms of reference, coordination arrangements with the webmaster and divisional focal points under the overall guidance of the Information and Communication Technology Committee with the view to ensuring reliable and comprehensive website support (SP-04-003-011) (para. 65). The terms of reference for the Information Master were established in early 2006 and were provided to the Human Resources Management Section. Several candidates were interviewed on three occasions and have identified a short list based on preliminary interviews. All technological competencies and experiences were reviewed and tested of the short-listed candidates and are awaiting the final substantive tests from the Chief, Information Centre. The Information Master post is to be established (initially for 6 months) with extrabudgetary funds and the candidate is supposed to work closely with the Information Office and the Office of the Executive Secretary. The Information Technology Unit, the IMIS Coordination Unit, and the Communications Unit should be consolidated into an Information Communications and Systems Section within Administrative Services Division to ensure the minimum resources for proper support to systems development, website maintenance and communications. The level of information technology-dedicated resources should be raised to the standard level of 5 per cent. Such strengthening should ensure a back up for the webmaster and a systems development post. Clear roles and responsibilities and reporting lines should be established to foster collaboration and information sharing. A backup system should also be established without delay to avoid instances where systems development and website support are not readily available (SP-04-003-012) (para. 67). The three units have been consolidated into the Information Communications and Systems Section within the Administrative Services Division. Currently, information technology-dedicated resources are at 2.5 per cent and every effort will be made to raise the level to 5 per cent. The back up for the webmaster and a systems development post has been implemented with clear roles and responsibilities been established and instituted. In line with the United Nations information and communication technology strategy, ESCWA should undertake a cost benefit analysis and a return on investment review of all of the databases developed and decide on their suitability, continuation, enhancement and streamlining. ESCWA should not develop any new systems or applications until its information and communications technology strategy is adopted and its Information and Communication Technology Committee established to undertake such reviews. Any future information and communications technology development should be based on the priorities and resources determined by the Information and Communication Technology Committee (SP-04-003-013) (para. 68). Work has just started on the development of an ICT strategy for ESCWA, and as a first step an inventory of systems and applications in preparation for a cost benefit analysis review has already been undertaken. (a) ESCWA should develop a knowledge management strategy based on its own recommendations to member States, UNDP experience and parameters and adopt an action plan for implementing it. The strategy should aim at establishing ESCWA as a source of knowledge on regional social and economic issues and the first point of call for diverse practitioners and stakeholders seeking such knowledge. Information technology should also provide for discussion space to facilitate exchanges between member States on the items on the Commission's agenda between its sessions. The knowledge management strategy should buttress the ESCWA communications and outreach strategy and rely on its information technology strategy. (b) A dedicated post of knowledge manager should be established with an incumbent being a recognized expert in this area and provided with all necessary authority and resources to implement the action plan (SP-04-003-014) (para. 69). The development of a knowledge management strategy and priority plan of action will be implemented, upon the recruitment of an expert in this area. Proposals are made in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, which would allow an existing P-4 post in the Office of the Executive Secretary to be used as the knowledge manager. At the Fourth Meeting of Chiefs of Programme Planning (Addis Ababa, January 2007), the five regional commissions exchanged knowledge management practices. The Meeting agreed that ECA would take the lead towards the development of a harmonized approach to knowledge management. ECA will make a set of recommendations highlighting the need for greater commitment in promoting knowledge management in all regional commissions at the meeting of the Executive Secretaries in Santiago in May 2007. ESCWA should undertake without delay a comprehensive review of its processes and workflows with the view to automating them in line with the best practices throughout the Secretariat based on a realistic action plan with set deadlines and responsibilities (SP-04-003-015) (para. 71). ESCWA identified 19 processes and workflows left for automation, five of them fall under the Human Resources Management Section namely contract extensions, separations, advances, dependency review and E-leave. An additional four workflows will be implemented in the Section in 2006-2007. The remaining ten are under review for implementation at the end of 2007. The Budget and Finance Section has introduced an automated electronic invoicing system to keep track and follow-up on all pending receivables. The Chief of the Human Resources Management Section should take appropriate measures to ensure that all personnel decisions are in line with the established policies and procedures and are properly reflected in staff members' personal files. Records of personnel actions should kept and monitored for compliance (SP-04-003-016) (para. 72). The Human Resources Management Section will continue to work within relevant policy guidelines, rules, regulations and all records of personnel actions will be kept in the staff member's personal files. Management should ensure that performance appraisals are completed on schedule (SP-04-003-017) (para. 74). The performance appraisal system (PAS) compliance rate during the 2004-2005 PAS cycle at ESCWA was 100 per cent. The PAS compliance (as at 18 December 2006) for the 2005-2006 PAS cycle is 99.34 per cent. The Executive Secretary should establish a senior level coordinating and advisory body to address programmatic and operational decisions along with establishing a mechanism for thorough follow-up on executive decisions taken on the advice of these bodies (SP-04-003-018) (para. 76). ESCWA will continue its ongoing policy of holding regular cabinet meetings (extended audience), and special meetings for programme managers (to address strategic and policy issues). The Executive Secretary should ensure that the norms of transparent and effective oversight are adhered to by observing established reporting lines and addressing accountability issues in a consistent and fair manner (SP-04-003-019) (para. 78). The Executive Secretary continues to work within relevant policy guidelines, rules and regulations. The Executive Secretary should clearly define the substantive and administrative responsibilities delegated to the Deputy Executive Secretary and maintain the integrity of such delegation along with accountability for discharging those responsibilities. Clear procedures and reporting lines to the Executive Secretary and regarding subprogramme managers should be established and observed (SP-04-003-020) (para. 80). The process of the selection and recruitment of a new Deputy Executive Secretary is under way, based on clear terms of reference and functions as contained in the ESCWA Secretary-General's bulletin and the various administrative circulars, and as approved by the Senior Review Group at United Nations Headquarters.
