Letter dated 23 February 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism addressed to the President of the Security Council I refer to my predecessor's letter of 7 February 2004 (S/2004/128), transmitting a fourth report from Croatia submitted to the Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 1373 (2001). The Counter-Terrorism Committee has considered the report carefully, with the assistance of its experts, and has written to the Permanent Representative of Croatia to the United Nations to set out its preliminary comments. Croatia has been requested to provide a response in the form of a fifth report by 26 April 2005. I should be grateful if you could arrange for the present letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Andrey I. Denisov Chairman Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism
