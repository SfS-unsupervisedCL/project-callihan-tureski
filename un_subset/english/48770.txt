Sixty-fourth session Agenda items 64, 131 and 132 Report of the Human Rights Council Programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 Revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council at its tenth and eleventh sessions Report of the Secretary-General Summary In section V of its resolution 63/263, the General Assembly endorsed the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/63/629), in which the Committee concluded that there was merit in an annual presentation to the Assembly of the revised estimates arising from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council as proposed in paragraph 105 (a) of the report of the Secretary-General (A/63/541). The present report therefore details the budgetary requirements estimated at $1,884,500 for the biennium 2008-2009 and $3,659,000 for the biennium 2010-2011 resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council at its tenth and eleventh sessions, held in 2009, as contained in its report to the General Assembly (A/64/53). The requirements of $1,884,500 for 2008-2009, which are considered as additional requirements, will be accommodated within the resources already appropriated and will be reported in the context of the second performance report of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. With respect to the estimated requirements of $3,659,000 (before recosting) for the biennium 2010-2011, $824,700 has been included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 as relating to activities of a "perennial nature". The balance of $2,834,300 is envisaged to be accommodated, to the extent possible, within the requirements proposed for the biennium 2010-2011. I. Introduction 1. The present annual report is submitted in line with the conclusion contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/63/629), in which the Committee stated that it saw merit in an annual presentation to the General Assembly of the revised estimates arising from the resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council. The Assembly endorsed that conclusion in part V of its resolution 63/263. The present report is therefore submitted in order to inform the Assembly of the requirements resulting from the resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council at its tenth and eleventh sessions, held in 2009 (see A/64/53). It should be noted that the requirements resulting from the resolutions and/or decisions adopted by the Council at its twelfth session, scheduled to be held from 14 September to 2 October 2009, will be considered in the next annual report. 2. Although the Council held three special sessions (ninth, tenth and eleventh special sessions) during 2009 (held through 9 September 2009), additional resources arose only with regard to the decisions taken at the ninth special session (see A/64/53), as detailed in the report of the Secretary-General (A/63/853). The Secretary-General therefore maintains his earlier opinion, set out in paragraph 23.15 of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 (A/64/6 (Sect. 23)), that additional experience needs to be gained before presenting a comprehensive proposal on the treatment of the additional resources arising from mandates relating to special missions. This issue is therefore not discussed in the present report. 3. The Council adopted a number of resolutions and one decision, by which it authorized relevant human rights bodies and special procedures to continue or to undertake additional activities, including meetings. In its decision 11/117, the Council decided that all reports of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review should be issued in all official languages of the Organization. The resolutions and the decision require provisions in addition to the resources approved in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 and in the initial proposals of the Secretary-General for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. Accordingly, under rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the Council was provided, where appropriate, with a statement of programme budget implications prior to the adoption of the relevant resolutions and of the decision. 4. Some of the requirements resulting from the resolutions adopted by the Council relate to activities of a "perennial nature", for which provisions have already been made in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 and in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. It should be noted that implementation of the activities of a "perennial nature" called for in Human Rights Council resolutions 10/16, 10/27, 10/32, 11/10 and 11/12, for which provisions have already been made in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011, require resources of $824,700 (before recosting). In respect of resolutions 10/11, 10/23, 10/33, 11/1, 11/2, 11/3, 11/4, 11/8 and decision 11/117, as the mandates are new, no provisions have been made in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 or in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 for the respective additional requirements of $1,855,500 and $2,834,300 (before recosting). Requirements of $29,000 for resolution 11/9, which is also a new mandate, is required for the biennium 2008-2009 only. All proposed requirements would be accommodated within the existing appropriation for the biennium 2008-2009 and within the provisions contained in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. A summary of all the requirements is provided in the annex to the present report, including the new mandates, namely, resolutions 10/11, 10/23, 10/33, 11/1, 11/2, 11/3, 11/4, 11/8, 11/9 and decision 11/117, as well as resolution 11/10, whose mandate replaces an existing mandate. 5. With regard to resolutions 10/11, 10/16, 10/23, 10/27, 11/1, 11/3 and 11/9, the attention of the Human Rights Council was drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. II. Additional requirements relating to the resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council A. Resolution 10/11: The use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination 6. In operative paragraphs 13, 16 and 18 of resolution 10/11, the Human Rights Council: (a) Requested the Working Group to: (i) Consult with intergovernmental, non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and experts on the content and scope of a possible draft convention on private companies offering military assistance, consultancy and other military security-related services on the international market, and an accompanying model law, and other legal instruments; (ii) Share with Member States, through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, elements for a possible draft convention on private military and security companies, requesting their input on the content and scope of such a convention and to transmit their replies to the Working Group; (iii) Report to the fifteenth session of the Human Rights Council on the progress achieved in the elaboration of the draft legal instrument for proper consideration and action; (b) Requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner to continue supporting the Working Group in convening regional governmental consultations on the matter, in conformity with paragraph 15 of General Assembly resolution 62/145, with the remaining three to be held before the end of 2010, bearing in mind that the process might lead to the holding of a high-level round table of States, under the auspices of the United Nations, to discuss the fundamental question of the role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the use of force, with the objective of facilitating a critical understanding of the responsibilities of the different actors, including private military and security companies, in the current context, and their respective obligations for the protection and promotion of human rights and in reaching a common understanding as to which additional regulations and controls were needed at the international level; (c) Requested the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide the Working Group with all the necessary assistance and support for the fulfilment of its mandate, both professional and financial, including through the promotion of cooperation between the Working Group and other components of the United Nations system that dealt with countering mercenary-related activities, in order to meet the demands of its current and future activities. 7. Requirements in support of the activities of the Working Group are considered as perennials and have therefore been included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 and the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. However, the resource requirements with regard to anticipated regional consultations in Africa have not been provided for in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. Adoption of resolution 10/11 by the Human Rights Council therefore gives rise to estimated additional requirements of $316,600 in 2010, as follows: (a) Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management: conference servicing cost ($112,200); (b) Section 23, Human rights ($204,400): travel of five members of the Working Group ($29,200); travel of 52 representatives for two working days ($135,200); travel of five experts for two working days ($29,200); travel of staff to accompany the members of the Working Group ($10,800). 8. The Secretariat, having reviewed its proposals for the biennium 2010-2011 to determine if the additional requirements of $316,600 to implement the activities for the regional consultations in Africa could be met within the provisions under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011, concluded that every effort would be made to accommodate the requirements from within the proposed resources. Accordingly, no additional provisions would be requested for the biennium 2010-2011. B. Resolution 10/23: Independent expert in the field of cultural rights 9. In operative paragraphs 9 through 12 of resolution 10/23, the Human Rights Council, inter alia: (a) Decided to establish, for a period of three years, a new special procedure entitled "Independent expert in the field of cultural rights", as set out in the relevant United Nations human rights instruments; (b) Called upon all Governments to cooperate with and assist the independent expert in the discharge of his or her mandate, to provide him or her with all the necessary information requested by him or her and to give serious consideration to responding favourably to his or her requests to visit their countries in order to enable him or her to fulfil his or her duties effectively; (c) Requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all the necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the independent expert; (d) Requested the independent expert to present his or her first report to the Council in accordance with its programme of work. 10. Adoption of resolution 10/23 by the Human Rights Council, gives rise to estimated additional requirements of $338,800 per annum, or $677,600 per biennium, to implement activities, as follows: (a) Section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, and section 28E, Administration, Geneva: conference services for the organization of a two-day consultation per year, involving all relevant stakeholders, with a view to advancing the identification of proposals enhancing international cooperation, overcoming obstacles and filling gaps in the promotion and protection of cultural rights, as well as to clarifying the content and scope of cultural diversity ($111,600) per biennium, comprising: (i) under section 2 ($108,600); and (ii) under section 28E ($3,000)); (b) Section 23, Human rights ($566,000): (i) travel of the independent expert for consultations/to attend the annual meeting of special procedures, to present his/her report to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, two field missions per year, two missions per year to attend and follow up on relevant international conferences and events ($109,800 per biennium); (ii) travel of five experts (from each region) for annual consultations ($76,400 per biennium); (iii) travel of staff to accompany the independent expert during field missions ($20,800 per biennium); (iv) one P-3 staff to assist the independent expert (throughout the 12 months of the year) ($311,000 per biennium); (v) local transportation, security, communications and other miscellaneous expenses during field missions ($8,000 per biennium); and (vi) consultant services (two work months each year) to assist the independent expert on technical matters related to the identification of good practices and lessons learned and on studies to clarify the content and scope of cultural rights and their relationship with respect to cultural diversity ($40,000 per biennium). 11. The requirements to implement the activities for the mandate of the independent expert have not been included under sections 2, 23, and 28E of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 or in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. It is envisaged that activities to implement the mandate will commence in November 2009, with the appointment of the expert and his/her visit to Geneva for a briefing, estimated at $7,800, to be met from within the appropriation under section 23, Human rights, of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. The period of the mandate of the independent expert extends into the biennium 2010-2011. Following a review of recent similar mandates, it is therefore estimated that requirements of $338,800 per annum, or $677,600 per biennium (see paragraph 10 above) will be required for that period. The requirements of $677,600 are proposed to be met within the provisions proposed under sections 2 ($108,000), 23 ($566,000) and 28E ($3,000) of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. No additional provisions would therefore be requested. C. Resolution 10/33: Situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the strengthening of technical cooperation and consultative services 12. In operative paragraphs 5 and 10 of resolution 10/33, the Human Rights Council: (a) Noted the report of the seven thematic special procedures on technical assistance to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and urgent examination of the situation in the east of the country (A/HRC/10/59) submitted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, acting on behalf of the other six special representatives and special rapporteurs, and invited them to report again to the Council at its thirteenth session on the development of the situation; (b) Called on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to increase and enhance, through its presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, its technical assistance programmes and activities, in consultation with the authorities of the country. 13. Adoption of the resolution by the Human Rights Council gives rise to requirements of $132,900 under section 23, Human rights, to implement the activities called for in operative paragraph 5 as follows: (a) Travel of the Special Representative to present the report of the seven experts to the Human Rights Council and travel of the seven special representatives for one field mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo ($74,900); (b) Travel of staff to accompany the special representatives during the field mission ($44,000); (c) Local transportation, security, communications and other miscellaneous expenses during the field mission ($14,000). 14. The requirements to implement the activities have not been included under section 23, Human rights, of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Since the period of the terms of the resolution extends into the biennium 2010-2011, it is envisaged that requirements estimated at $125,200 for the biennium 2008-2009 will be met from within the appropriation under section 23, Human rights, of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, and that requirements estimated at $7,700 for the biennium 2010-2011 will be met from within the provisions included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. No additional provisions would be required as a result of the adoption of the resolution. D. Resolution 11/1: Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure 15. In operative paragraphs 1 to 4 of resolution 11/1, the Human Rights Council: (a) Decided to establish an Open-ended Working Group of the Human Rights Council to explore the possibility of elaborating an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure complementary to the reporting procedure under the Convention; (b) Also decided that the Working Group should hold its first session for five working days in Geneva before the end of 2009, within existing resources; (c) Further decided to invite a representative of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to attend the session as a resource person and, where appropriate, relevant United Nations special procedures and other relevant independent experts, and invited them to submit possible inputs to the Working Group for its consideration; (d) Requested the Working Group to submit a report on progress made to the Council for consideration at its thirteenth session. 16. Adoption of resolution 11/1 by the Human Rights Council gives rise to requirements, estimated at $282,700 for the biennium 2008-2009, to implement the activities, as follows: (a) under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, to provide conference servicing ($199,200); (b) under section 23, Human rights, to provide for staff at the P-3 level for four months to support the work of the Working Group ($56,000) and for the travel of a member of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to attend the Working Group session ($23,800); and (c) under section 28E, Administration, Geneva, to provide conference servicing ($3,700). The requirements in support of the activities of the Working Group have not been included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Although it is anticipated that a total additional amount of $282,700 would be required for the biennium 2008-2009, no additional resources are requested since the requirements will be met from within the appropriations approved under sections 2, 23 and 28E for the biennium 2008-2009. For the biennium 2010-2011, it is anticipated that the Open-ended Working Group will hold two sessions per annum for a duration of one week each, with total estimated requirements of $1,130,800, as follows: (a) under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, to provide conference servicing ($796,800); (b) under section 23, Human rights, to provide general temporary assistance and travel ($319,200); and under section 28E, Administration, Geneva, to provide conference servicing ($14,800). It is proposed to meet the additional requirements for the biennium 2010-2011 within the provisions for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. E. Resolution 11/2: Accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women 17. In operative paragraph 11 (d) of resolution 11/12, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene in 2010, within existing resources, in cooperation with other relevant entities of the United Nations system, an expert workshop open to the participation of Governments, regional organizations and experts from different legal systems, which would discuss specific measures for overcoming obstacles and challenges States might face in preventing, investigating, prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators of violence against women and girls, as well as measures for providing protection, support, assistance and redress for victims, and requested the Office to produce a summary report to be submitted to the Human Rights Council. 18. Adoption of resolution 11/2 by the Human Rights Council gives rise to additional requirements to implement the activities called for in operative paragraph 11 (d), which are estimated at $172,800 for the biennium 2010-2011, as follows: (a) under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, to provide conference servicing ($110,800); (b) under section 23, Human rights, to provide for travel of 10 experts to attend the workshop ($60,400); and (c) under section 28E, Administration, Geneva, for conference servicing ($1,600). The requirements in support of the activities have not been included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. However, it is proposed that the additional requirements for the biennium 2010-2011 be met within the provisions of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. F. Resolution 11/3: Trafficking in persons, especially women and children 19. In operative paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of resolution 11/3, the Human Rights Council: (a) Requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize, within existing resources, and in close coordination with the Special Rapporteur, a two-day seminar aimed at identifying opportunities and challenges in the development of rights-based responses to trafficking in persons, with a view to acknowledging emerging good practices and further promoting the practical application of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, with the participation of Governments, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and other relevant special procedures, treaty bodies, United Nations specialized agencies and programmes, regional, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions, academics, medical experts and representatives of victims, and to submit a report on the proceedings of the seminar to the Council; (b) Also requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to disseminate the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking and to collect the views of stakeholders, including Governments, observers of the United Nations, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized agencies and programmes, regional bodies, non-governmental organizations, and national human rights institutions, on the Principles and Guidelines and on experiences and emerging good practices while applying them, and to make available to the Human Rights Council a compilation of those views as an addendum to the Guidelines and Principles; (c) Further requested the Secretary General to provide the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with sufficient resources to fulfil its mandate in relation to combating trafficking in persons, especially women and children. 20. Adoption of resolution 11/3 by the Human Rights Council gives rise to additional requirements estimated at $268,700 for the biennium 2010-2011, to implement the activities, as follows: (a) under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, for conference servicing ($110,800); (b) under section 23, Human rights, for consultancy services ($14,000) and for travel of experts ($90,600) and special procedures holders ($51,700) to attend the seminar; and (c) under section 28E, Administration, Geneva, for conference servicing ($1,600). 21. Although provisions have not been included under sections 2, 23 and 28E of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 to implement activities called for in operative paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the resolution, the Secretariat has reviewed the potential absorptive capacity from within sections 2, 23 and 28E and proposes that the additional requirements of $268,700 be met within the provisions for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. G. Resolution 11/4: Promotion of the right of peoples to peace 22. In operative paragraphs 11 and 12 of resolution 11/4, the Human Rights Council, inter alia: (a) Reiterated its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene, before February 2010, and taking into account previous practices, a workshop on the right of peoples to peace, with the participation of experts from all regions of the world; (b) Requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report on the outcome of the workshop to the Council at its fourteenth session. 23. Adoption of resolution 11/4 by the Human Rights Council gives rise to additional requirements, estimated at $186,800 for the biennium 2010-2011, to implement the activities, as follows: (a) under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, for conference services for a three-day workshop in 2010 ($110,800); (b) under section 23, Human rights, for general temporary assistance at the P-3 level ($14,000) and travel and daily subsistence allowance for 10 experts from five regions ($60,400); and (c) under section 28E, Administration, Geneva, for conference servicing ($1,600). 24. Although provisions have not been included under sections 2, 23 and 28E of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 to implement the activities called for in operative paragraphs 11 and 12 of the resolution, the Secretariat has reviewed the potential absorptive capacity to meet the estimated requirements of $186,800, under Sections 2, 23 and 28E and proposes that the additional requirements be met within the provisions for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. H. Resolution 11/8: Preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights 25. In operative paragraph 6 of resolution 11/8, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a thematic study on preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights, in consultation with States, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Bank, and all other relevant stakeholders, and requested that the study include identification of the human rights dimensions of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in the existing international legal framework; to prepare an overview of initiatives and activities within the United Nations system to address all causes of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity; to identify how the Human Rights Council could add value to existing initiatives through a human rights analysis, including efforts to achieve Goal 5 of the Millennium Development Goals, on improving maternal health; and recommended options for better addressing the human rights dimension of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity throughout the United Nations system. 26. Adoption of resolution 11/8 by the Human Rights Council gives rise to additional requirements, estimated at $73,300 under section 23, Human rights to provide for consultancy services. Although provisions have not been included under section 23 of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 to implement those activities, the Secretariat has reviewed the potential absorptive capacity of section 23 and proposes that the additional requirements be met within the provisions for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. I. Resolution 11/9: The human rights of migrants in detention centres 27. In operative paragraphs 1 and 3 of resolution 11/9, the Human Rights Council: (a) Decided to hold a panel of discussion on the human rights of migrants in detention centres at its twelfth session, with equitable geographic and gender participation of representatives of Governments, relevant experts and civil society, including national institutions; (b) Requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide the necessary assistance and support for holding the panel. 28. Adoption of resolution 11/9 by the Human Rights Council gives rise to additional requirements, estimated at $29,000, under section 23, Human rights, of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 to provide for the travel and daily subsistence allowance of five experts. Although it is anticipated that an additional amount of $29,000 would be required in support of the activities, additional resources are not requested since the Secretariat intends to absorb the additional requirements within the appropriation for section 23, Human rights, for the biennium 2008-2009. J. Resolution 11/10: Situation of human rights in the Sudan 29. In operative paragraph 19 of resolution 11/10, the Human Rights Council decided to create the mandate of independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan for a period of one year, including that the independent expert should assume the mandate and responsibilities set out by the Council in its resolutions 6/34, 6/35, 7/16 and 9/17; requested the independent expert to engage with the newly created human rights forums in the Sudan, as well as the human rights sections of the African Union, the United Nations Mission in the Sudan and the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur, and to submit a report to the Council for consideration at its fourteenth session; and requested the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance to discharge the mandate fully. 30. During its eleventh session, the Council was informed that through adoption of the resolution as amended, the mandate of the independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan would replace the current mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The related financial implications amount to a total of $64,600 per year, or $129,200 per biennium, which is equivalent to the requirements of the former mandate, that have been included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 and for which similar provisions are made in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. No additional provisions are therefore associated with the adoption of the resolution. K. Decision 11/117: Issuance of reports of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review in all official languages of the United Nations 31. In operative paragraphs 1 to 3 of decision 11/117, the Human Rights Council: (a) Decided that all the reports adopted by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review at its fourth and fifth sessions and the additional information submitted by the States under review before the adoption of the outcome by the Council should be issued as official documents in all official languages of the United Nations, prior to the twelfth session of the Council and requested the Secretary-General to undertake the necessary measures to that effect; (b) Recalled that the Working Group should endeavour to apply in its reports the word limits established in the annex to the president's statement 9/2, bearing in mind that the Working Group was entrusted with the authority to decide on the adoption of reports that exceptionally exceed the word limits; (c) Decided that all reports adopted by the Working Group should be issued as official documents in all official languages of the United Nations, in a timely manner before their consideration by the Council, and requested the Secretary-General to ensure the necessary support to that effect. 32. Adoption of decision 11/117 by the Human Rights Council gives rise to requirements estimated at $1,439,800 for the biennium 2008-2009 for the translation of reports called for under the terms of the resolution. The requirements for translation of the reports of the Working Group were not included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. It is estimated that the total additional requirements of $1,439,800 could be met from within the overall resources appropriated under section 2 of the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 through the mechanism of integrated global management of resources. 33. Although the Council was informed during its eleventh session that requirements of $4,378,900 were estimated for the biennium 2010-2011, under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management in response to decision 11/117, the Secretary-General, in formulating his proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011, has included specific proposals designed to strengthen the permanent conference-servicing capacity of the United Nations Office at Geneva to meet increased demands stemming from the activities of the Human Rights Council and other human rights mechanisms. The experience with the universal periodic review mechanism, which held its first three sessions in 2008, showed that the associated documentation required increased resources. The mechanism includes six weeks of meetings per year, equivalent to the number of meetings of the former Commission on Human Rights. In addition, increased workloads in relation to other human rights bodies, including the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee against Torture, are expected to place additional strain on the resources. A proposed increase of $13,134,400, under section 2, Conference management, Geneva, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011, together with existing capacity, are expected to address the conference-servicing requirements of the Human Rights Council, its subsidiary machinery and the growing activities of human rights bodies. 34. It is anticipated that the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 63/284, on a review of the circumstances that had led to insufficient conference services having been put at the disposal of the Human Rights Council in 2009, will shed light on the sufficiency of the resources provided to the Conference Services Division of the United Nations Office at Geneva. Therefore, no additional requirements will be requested at this juncture for the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 and the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. III. Conclusions and action required of the General Assembly 35. As reflected in the annex to the present report, the implications of the resolutions and of the decision, adopted by the Human Rights Council at its tenth and eleventh sessions, held in 2009, give rise to total requirements of $1,884,500 for the biennium 2008-2009 and of $3,659,000 for the biennium 2010-2011. Requirements for the biennium 2008-2009 of $1,884,500 are proposed to be met within the resources appropriated under the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 and will be reported in the context of the second performance report for the biennium 2008-2009. 36. For the biennium 2010-2011, the total estimated requirements are $3,659,000, for which provisions of $824,700 have already been made in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 for activities of a "perennial nature". The balance of $2,834,300, required for implementation of the decisions of the Human Rights Council in the biennium 2010-2011, as reflected in the present report, are proposed to be met from within the provisions of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. 37. The General Assembly may therefore wish to take note of the present report.
