General Assembly Security Council Sixty-fourth session Agenda item 15 The situation in the Middle East Sixty-fifth year Identical letters dated 22 June 2010 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government, I transmit herewith a letter of complaint regarding a violation of the Blue Line that Israeli enemy forces committed on 12 June 2010 (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated as a document of the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 15, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Caroline Ziade Chargé d'affaires a.i. On 12 June 2010, Israeli enemy soldiers entered Lebanese territory on the outskirts of Kafr Shuba, near the Hassan Gate. This action was observed by Lebanese Army troops, who used loudspeakers to warn them that they must withdraw from Lebanese territory. However, the Israeli soldiers did not heed that warning, leading to an exchange of fire. While no one was injured, the Israeli soldiers were forced to withdraw towards their position at Ruwaysat al-Alam, inside the occupied Shab`a Farms. The entrance of Israeli soldiers into Lebanon is a flagrant violation of Lebanese sovereignty, international law and Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), as well as a threat to international peace and security.
