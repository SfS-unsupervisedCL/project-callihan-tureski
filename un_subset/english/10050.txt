UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/553 13 May 1999 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: ARABIC IDENTICAL LETTERS DATED 12 MAY 1999 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF IRAQ TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL AND TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to inform you as follows: At 1600 hours on 4 May 1999 a Kuwaiti patrol fired several shots at the Iraqi citizen Sabah Muhammad Ya`qub as he was fishing inside Iraqi territorial waters, hitting him in the head and other parts of the body. The boat carrying Mr. Ya`qub was also hit by several rounds. I request you to intervene with the Government of Kuwait with a view to inducing it to halt the acts of provocation and piracy carried out by Kuwaiti patrols in Iraqi territorial waters, which have recently become more frequent. Such actions are in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of international law, and they pose a threat to the security and sovereignty of a member State of the United Nations. I affirm Iraq's legally established right, in accordance with the principle of State responsibility, to seek lawful compensation for the damage done to its citizens and their property by these hostile acts. I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Saeed H. HASAN Ambassador Permanent Representative
