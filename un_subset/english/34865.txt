General Assembly Sixtieth session Agenda item 14 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Sixty-first year Identical letters dated 3 March 2006 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government, I transmit to you herewith a detailed statistical table showing the number of Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty which occurred during February 2006, i.e., a total of 72 violations. These violations are in contravention of the relevant Security Council resolutions, the latest of which is resolution 1655 (2006), and go against the Secretary-General's repeated calls for their cessation, most recently in his report S/2006/26 of 18 January 2006. Lebanon counts on the United Nations to compel Israel to desist from those violations, which constitute a threat to international peace and security, and holds Israel responsible for any consequences to which those acts may give rise. I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 14, and of the Security Council.
