Draft resolution II Strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women Reaffirming the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women, and, in particular, the determination of Governments to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women, Reaffirming also the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, as well as the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled "Women 2000: gender, equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century", and the declarations adopted at the forty-ninth and fifty-fourth sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women, Recognizing that the term "women", except where otherwise specified, encompasses "girl children", Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and reaffirming that discrimination on the basis of sex is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international human rights instruments and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of all forms of violence against women, Stressing that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent and investigate acts of violence against women and girls and punish the perpetrators, eliminate impunity and provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, Emphasizing the importance of preventing violence against migrant women through the implementation, inter alia, of measures aimed at combating racism, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance, Deeply concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination

women's poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of sustained development, can place them at increased risk of violence and that violence against women impedes the social and economic development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, Reaffirming its resolution 52/86 of 12 December 1997, in which it adopted the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence

act with respect to genocide or torture, Expressing deep concern about the pervasiveness of violence against women in all its forms and manifestations worldwide, and reiterating the need to intensify efforts to address that challenge, Recognizing that effective and integrated criminal justice responses to violence against women require close cooperation among all key stakeholders, including law enforcement officials, prosecutors, judges, victim advocates, health professionals and forensic scientists, Stressing the importance of a comprehensive, well-coordinated, effective and adequately resourced response by the United Nations system to all forms of violence against women, Recalling the joint dialogue of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Commission on Crime Prevention and

Annex Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Preamble 1. The multifaceted nature of violence against women necessitates different strategies to respond to the diverse manifestations of violence and the various settings in which it occurs, both in private and public life, whether committed in the home, the workplace, educational and training institutions, the community or society, in custody or in situations of armed conflict or natural disaster. In the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the importance of adopting a systematic, comprehensive, coordinated, multisectoral and sustained approach to fighting violence against women is recognized. The practical measures, strategies and activities described below can be introduced in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice to address violence against women. Except where otherwise specified, the term "women" encompasses "girl children". 2. Violence against women exists in every country in the world as a pervasive violation of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development and peace. Violence against women is rooted in historically unequal power relations between men and women. All forms of violence against women seriously violate and impair or nullify the enjoyment by women of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and have serious immediate and long-term implications for health, including sexual and reproductive health, for example through increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and public safety, and have a negative impact on the psychological, social and economic development of individuals, families, communities and States. 3. Violence against women is often embedded in and supported by social values, cultural patterns and practices. The criminal justice system and legislators are not immune to such values and thus have not always regarded violence against women with the same seriousness as other types of violence. Therefore, it is important that States strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligation with respect to its elimination and that the criminal justice system recognize violence against women as a gender-related problem and as an expression of power and inequality. 4. Violence against women is defined in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and reiterated in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women to mean any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures build on the measures adopted by Governments in the Platform for Action, which was adopted in 1995 and subsequently reaffirmed in 2000 and 2005, the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted in 1997, and relevant General Assembly resolutions, including Assembly resolutions 61/143 and 63/155, bearing in mind that some groups of women are especially exposed and vulnerable to violence. 5. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures specifically acknowledge the need for an active policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies, programmes and practices to ensure gender equality and equal and fair access to justice, as well as establishing the goal of gender balance in all areas of decision-making, including those related to the elimination of violence against women. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be applied as guidelines in a manner consistent with relevant international instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime, with a view to furthering their fair and effective implementation. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures reaffirm the commitment of States to promote gender equality and empower women with a view to meeting Goal 3 of the Millennium Development Goals. 6. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be endorsed by national legislation and implemented by Member States and other entities in a manner consistent with the right to equality before the law, while also recognizing that gender equality may sometimes require the adoption of different approaches that acknowledge the different ways in which violence affects women as compared to men. Member States should ensure that women have equal protection under the law and equal access to justice in order to facilitate efforts by Governments to prevent and sanction acts of violence against women through comprehensive and coordinated policies and strategies, and to deal with all forms of violence against women within the criminal justice system. 7. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women must be focused on the needs of victims and empower individual women who are victims of violence. They aim at ensuring that prevention and intervention efforts are made to not only stop and appropriately sanction violence against women, but also restore a sense of dignity and control to the victims of such violence. 8. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at contributing to de jure and de facto equality between women and men. They do not give preferential treatment to women but aim at ensuring that any inequalities or forms of discrimination that women face in accessing justice, particularly in respect of acts of violence, are redressed. 9. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that sexual violence is an issue of international peace and security, as outlined in Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women and peace and security, particularly the need for parties to armed conflict to adopt prevention and protection measures in order to end sexual violence. 10. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that some special groups of women are particularly vulnerable to violence, either because of their nationality, ethnicity, religion or language or because they belong to an indigenous group, are migrants, are stateless, are refugees, live in underdeveloped, rural or remote communities, are homeless, are in institutions or in detention, have disabilities, are elderly, are widowed or live in conflict, post-conflict or disaster situations, and as such, require special attention, intervention and protection in the development of crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women. 11. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize advances in crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women and the importance of investing in the prevention of violence against women. 12. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that States have the obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, including women, and that they must exercise due diligence and take relevant measures to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women, to eliminate impunity and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of women's human rights and fundamental freedoms.

III. Criminal procedure 15. Member States are urged to review, evaluate and update their criminal procedures, as appropriate and taking into account all relevant international legal instruments, in order to ensure that: (a) The police and other law enforcement agencies have, with judicial authorization where required by national law, adequate powers to enter premises and conduct arrests in cases of violence against women and to take immediate measures to ensure the safety of victims; (b) The primary responsibility for initiating investigations and prosecutions lies with the police and prosecution authorities and does not rest with women subjected to violence, regardless of the level or form of violence; (c) Women subjected to violence are enabled to testify in criminal proceedings through adequate measures that facilitate such testimony by protecting the privacy, identity and dignity of the women; ensure safety during legal proceedings; and avoid "secondary victimization". In jurisdictions where the safety of the victim cannot be guaranteed, refusing to testify should not constitute a criminal or other offence; (d) Evidentiary rules are non-discriminatory; all relevant evidence can be brought before the court; rules and principles of defence do not discriminate against women; and "honour" or "provocation" cannot be invoked by perpetrators of violence against women to escape criminal responsibility; (e) The credibility of a complainant in a sexual violence case is understood to be the same as that of a complainant in any other criminal proceeding; the introduction of the complainant's sexual history in both civil and criminal proceedings is prohibited when it is unrelated to the case; and no adverse inference is drawn solely from a delay of any length between the alleged commission of a sexual offence and the reporting thereof; (f) People who perpetrate acts of violence against women while voluntarily under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other substances are not exempted from criminal responsibility; (g) Evidence of prior acts of violence, abuse, stalking and exploitation by the perpetrator is considered during court proceedings, in accordance with the principles of national criminal law; (h) Police and courts have the authority to issue and enforce protection and restraining or barring orders in cases of violence against women, including removal of the perpetrator from the domicile, prohibiting further contact with the victim and other affected parties, inside and outside the domicile; to issue and enforce child support and custody orders; and to impose penalties for breaches of those orders. If such powers cannot be granted to the police, measures must be taken to ensure timely access to court decisions in order to ensure swift action by the court. Such protective measures should not be dependent on the initiation of a criminal case; (i) Comprehensive services and protection measures are taken when necessary to ensure the safety, privacy and dignity of victims and their families at all stages of the criminal justice process, without prejudice to the victim's ability or willingness to participate in an investigation or prosecution, and to protect them from intimidation and retaliation, including by establishing comprehensive witness and victim protection programmes; (j) Safety risks, including the vulnerability of victims, are taken into account in decisions concerning non-custodial or quasi-custodial sentences, the granting of bail, conditional release, parole or probation, especially when dealing with repeat and dangerous offenders; (k) Claims of self-defence by women who have been victims of violence, particularly in cases of battered woman syndrome, are taken into account in investigations, prosecutions and sentences against them; (l) All procedures and complaint mechanisms are accessible to women who are victims of violence without fear of reprisal or discrimination.

crime prevention and criminal justice primarily related to the treatment of prisoners, in particular the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, the procedures for the effective implementation of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment and the Basic Principles for the Treatment of Prisoners, Recalling also the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice primarily related to alternatives to imprisonment, in particular the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules) and the basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters, Recalling further its resolution 58/183 of 22 December 2003, in which it invited Governments, relevant international and regional bodies, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to devote increased attention to the issue of women in prison, including the children of women in prison, with a view to identifying the key problems and the ways in which they can be addressed, Considering the alternatives to imprisonment as provided for in the Tokyo Rules and taking into consideration the gender specificities of, and the consequent need to give priority to applying non-custodial measures to, women who have come into contact with the criminal justice system, Mindful of its resolution 61/143 of 19 December 2006, in which it urged States to, inter alia, take positive measures to address structural causes of violence against women and to strengthen prevention efforts that addressed discriminatory practices and social norms, including with regard to women who need special attention in the development of policies to address violence, such as women in institutions or in detention, Mindful also of its resolution 63/241 of 24 December 2008, in which it called upon all States to give attention to the impact of parental detention and imprisonment on children and, in particular, to identify and promote good practices in relation to the needs and physical, emotional, social and psychological development of babies and children affected by parental detention and imprisonment, Taking into consideration the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century, in which Member States committed themselves, inter alia, to the development of action-oriented policy recommendations based on the special needs of women as prisoners and offenders, and the plans of action for the implementation of the Declaration, Calling attention to the Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses: Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, as it relates specifically to women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings, Recalling that, in the Bangkok Declaration, Member States recommended to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice that it give consideration to reviewing the adequacy of standards and norms in relation to prison management and prisoners, Having taken note of the initiative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to designate the week from 6 to 12 October 2008 as Dignity and Justice for Detainees Week, which placed particular emphasis on the human rights of women and girls, Considering that women prisoners are one of the vulnerable groups that have specific needs and requirements, Aware of the fact that many existing prison facilities worldwide were designed primarily for male prisoners, whereas the number of female prisoners has significantly increased over the years, Recognizing that a number of female offenders do not pose a risk to society and, as with all offenders, their imprisonment may render their social reintegration more difficult, Welcoming the development by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime of the Handbook for Prison Managers and Policymakers on Women and Imprisonment, Welcoming also the invitation contained in Human Rights Council resolution 10/2 of 25 March 2009 to Governments, relevant international and regional bodies, national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to devote greater attention to the issue of women and girls in prison, including issues relating to the children of women in prison, with a view to identifying and addressing the gender-specific aspects and challenges related to this problem, Welcoming further the collaboration between the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and taking note of the Kyiv Declaration on Women's Health in Prisons, Taking note of the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, Recalling Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 18/1 of 24 April 2009, in which the Commission requested

Declaration on Comprehensive Strategies for Global Challenges: Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Systems and Their Development in a Changing World, in which Member States recommended that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice consider the draft United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders as a matter of priority for appropriate action, 1. Takes note with appreciation of the work of the expert group to develop supplementary rules specific to the treatment of women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings at its meeting held in Bangkok from 23 to 26 November 2009 and of the outcome of that meeting; 2. Expresses its gratitude to the Government of Thailand for having acted as host to the meeting of the expert group and for the financial support provided for the organization of the meeting; 3. Adopts the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders, annexed to the present resolution, and approves the recommendation of the Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice that the Rules should be known as "the Bangkok Rules"; 4. Recognizes that, in view of the great variety of legal, social, economic and geographical conditions in the world, not all of the rules can be applied equally in all places and at all times; and that they should, however, serve to stimulate a constant endeavour to overcome practical difficulties in their application, in the knowledge that they represent, as a whole, global aspirations amenable to the common goal of improving outcomes for women prisoners, their children and their communities; 5. Encourages Member States to adopt legislation to establish alternatives to imprisonment and to give priority to the financing of such systems, as well as to the development of the mechanisms needed for their implementation; 6.

Invites Member States to take into consideration the specific needs and realities of women as prisoners when developing relevant legislation, procedures, policies and action plans and to draw, as appropriate, on the Bangkok Rules; 8. Also invites Member States to collect, maintain, analyse and publish, as appropriate, specific data on women in prison and women offenders; 9. Emphasizes that, when sentencing or deciding on pretrial measures for a pregnant woman or a child's sole or primary caretaker, non-custodial measures should be preferred where possible and appropriate, with custodial sentences being considered when the offence is serious or violent; 10. Requests the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to provide technical assistance and advisory services to Member States, upon request, in order to develop or strengthen, as appropriate, legislation, procedures, policies and practices for women in prison and on alternatives to imprisonment for women offenders; 11. Also requests the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to take steps, as appropriate, to ensure broad dissemination of the Bangkok Rules, as a supplement to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners1 and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules),5 and the intensification of information activities in this area; 12. Further requests the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to increase its cooperation with other relevant United Nations entities, intergovernmental and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations in the provision of relevant assistance to countries and to identify needs and capacities of countries in order to increase country-to-country and South-South cooperation; 13. Invites specialized agencies of the United Nations system and relevant regional and international intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to engage in the implementation of the Bangkok Rules; 14. Invites Member States and other donors to provide extrabudgetary contributions for such purposes, in accordance with the rules and procedures of the United Nations. Preliminary observations 1. The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners1 apply to all prisoners without discrimination; therefore, the specific needs and realities of all prisoners, including of women prisoners, should be taken into account in their application. The Rules, adopted more than 50 years ago, did not, however, draw sufficient attention to women's particular needs. With the increase in the number of women prisoners worldwide, the need to bring more clarity to considerations that should apply to the treatment of women prisoners has acquired importance and urgency. 2. Recognizing the need to provide global standards with regard to the distinct considerations that should apply to women prisoners and offenders and taking into account a number of relevant resolutions adopted by different United Nations bodies, in which Member States were called on to respond appropriately to the needs of women offenders and prisoners, the present rules have been developed to complement and supplement, as appropriate, the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Noncustodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules)5 in connection with the treatment of women prisoners and alternatives to imprisonment for women offenders. 3. The present rules do not in any way replace the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners or the Tokyo Rules and, therefore, all relevant provisions contained in those two sets of rules continue to apply to all prisoners and offenders without discrimination. While some of the present rules bring further clarity to existing provisions in the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and in the Tokyo Rules in their application to women prisoners and offenders, others cover new areas. 4. These rules are inspired by principles contained in various United Nations conventions and declarations and are therefore consistent with the provisions of existing international law. They are addressed to prison authorities and criminal justice agencies (including policymakers, legislators, the prosecution service, the judiciary and the probation service) involved in the administration of non-custodial sanctions and community-based measures. 5. The specific requirements for addressing the situation of women offenders have been emphasized at the United Nations in various contexts. For example, in 1980, the Sixth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders adopted a resolution on the specific needs of women prisoners, in which it recommended that, in the implementation of the resolutions adopted by the Sixth Congress directly or indirectly relevant to the treatment of offenders, recognition should be given to the specific problems of women prisoners and the need to provide the means for their solution; that, in countries where it was not yet done, programmes and services used as alternatives to imprisonment should be made available to women offenders on an equal basis with male offenders; and that the United Nations, the governmental and non-governmental organizations in consultative status with it and all other international organizations should make continuing efforts to ensure that the woman offender was treated fairly and equally during arrest, trial, sentence and imprisonment, particular attention being paid to the special problems which women offenders encounter, such as pregnancy and child care. 6. The Seventh Congress, the Eighth Congress and the Ninth Congress also made specific recommendations concerning women prisoners. 7. In the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century,7 adopted also by the Tenth Congress, Member States committed themselves to taking into account and addressing, within the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, as well as within national crime prevention and criminal justice strategies, any disparate impact of programmes and policies on women and men (para. 11); and to the development of action-oriented policy recommendations based on the special needs of women as prisoners and offenders (para. 12). The plans of action for the implementation of the Vienna Declaration8 contain a separate section (sect. XIII) devoted to specific recommended measures to follow up on the commitments undertaken in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Declaration, including that of States reviewing, evaluating and, if necessary, modifying their legislation, policies, procedures and practices relating to criminal matters, in a manner consistent with their legal systems, in order to ensure that women are treated fairly by the criminal justice system. 8. The General Assembly, in its resolution 58/183 of 22 December 2003, entitled "Human rights in the administration of justice", called for increased attention to be devoted to the issue of women in prison, including the children of women in prison, with a view to identifying the key problems and ways in which they could be addressed. 9. In its resolution 61/143 of 19 December 2006, entitled "Intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women", the General Assembly stressed that "violence against women" meant any act of gender-based violence resulting in, or likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life, and urged States to review and, where appropriate, revise, amend or abolish all laws, regulations, policies, practices and customs discriminating against women or having a discriminatory impact on women, and ensure that provisions of multiple legal systems, where they existed, complied with international human rights obligations, commitments and principles, including the principle of non-discrimination; to take positive measures to address structural causes of violence against women and to strengthen prevention efforts addressing discriminatory practices and social norms, including with regard to women in need of special attention, such as women in institutions or in detention; and to provide training and capacity-building on gender equality and women's rights for law enforcement personnel and the judiciary. The resolution is an acknowledgement of the fact that violence against women has specific implications for women's contact with the criminal justice system, as well as their right to be free of victimization while imprisoned. Physical and psychological safety is critical to ensuring human rights and improving outcomes for women offenders, of which the present rules take account. 10. Finally, in the Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses: Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,9 adopted by the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 25 April 2005, Member States declared that they were committed to the development and maintenance of fair and efficient criminal justice institutions, including the humane treatment of all those in pretrial and correctional facilities, in accordance with applicable international standards (para. 8); and they recommended that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice should give consideration to reviewing the adequacy of standards and norms in relation to prison management and prisoners (para. 30). 11. As with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, in view of the great variety of legal, social, economic and geographical conditions worldwide, it is evident that not all of the following rules can be equally applied in all places and at all times. They should, however, serve to stimulate a constant endeavour to overcome practical difficulties in how they are applied, in the knowledge that they represent, as a whole, the global aspirations considered by the United Nations as leading to the common goal of improving outcomes for women prisoners, their children and their communities. 12. Some of these rules address issues applicable to both men and women prisoners, including those relating to parental responsibilities, some medical services, searching procedures and the like, although the rules are mainly concerned with the needs of women and their children. However, as the focus includes the children of imprisoned mothers, there is a need to recognize the central role of both parents in the lives of children. Accordingly, some of these rules would apply equally to male prisoners and offenders who are fathers. Introduction 13. The following rules do not in any way replace the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Tokyo Rules. Therefore, all provisions contained in those two sets of rules continue to apply to all prisoners and offenders without discrimination. 14. Section I of the present rules, covering the general management of institutions, is applicable to all categories of women deprived of their liberty, including criminal or civil, untried or convicted women prisoners, as well as women subject to "security measures" or corrective measures ordered by a judge. 15. Section II contains rules applicable only to the special categories dealt with in each subsection. Nevertheless, the rules under subsection A, applicable to prisoners under sentence, shall be equally applicable to the category of prisoners dealt with in subsection B, provided they do not conflict with the rules governing that category of women and are for their benefit. 16. Subsections A and B both provide additional rules for the treatment of juvenile female prisoners. It is important to note, however, that separate strategies and policies in accordance with international standards, in particular the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (Beijing Rules), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty and the Guidelines for Action on Children in the Criminal Justice System, need to be designed for the treatment and rehabilitation of this category of prisoners, while institutionalization shall be avoided to the maximum possible extent. 17. Section III contains rules covering the application of non-custodial sanctions and measures for women and juvenile female offenders, including on arrest and at the pretrial, sentencing and post-sentencing stages of the criminal justice process. 18. Section IV contains rules on research, planning, evaluation, public awareness-raising and sharing of information, and is applicable to all categories of female offenders covered in these rules. I. Rules of general application 1.

We acknowledge the value and impact of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice and endeavour to use those standards and norms as guiding principles in designing and implementing our national crime prevention and criminal justice policies, laws, procedures and programmes. 4. Bearing in mind the universal character of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, we invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider reviewing and, if necessary, updating and supplementing them. In order to render them effective, we recommend that appropriate efforts be made to promote the widest application of those standards and norms and to raise awareness of them among authorities and entities responsible for their application at the national level. 5. We acknowledge the need for Member States to ensure effective gender equality in crime prevention, access to justice and the protection offered by the criminal justice system. 6. We express deep concern about the pervasiveness of violence against women in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and urge States to enhance efforts to prevent, prosecute and punish violence against women. In this regard, we note with appreciation the draft updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, as finalized by the intergovernmental expert group at its meeting held in Bangkok from 23 to 25 March 2009, and look forward to their consideration by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. 7. We recognize the importance of adopting appropriate legislation and policies to prevent victimization, including revictimization, and to provide protection and assistance to victims. 8. We consider that international cooperation and technical assistance can play an important role in achieving sustainable and long-lasting results in the prevention, prosecution and punishment of crime, in particular by building, modernizing and strengthening our criminal justice systems and promoting the rule of law. Specific technical assistance programmes should thus be designed to achieve these aims, for all the components of the criminal justice system, in an integrated way and with a long-term perspective, enabling the capacity of requesting States to prevent and suppress the various types of crime affecting their societies, including organized crime. In that regard, the experience and expertise accumulated over the years by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime constitute a valuable asset. 9. We strongly recommend the allocation of sufficient human and financial resources to develop and implement effective policies, programmes and training dealing with crime prevention, criminal justice and the prevention of terrorism. In this regard, we stress the serious need to provide the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime with a level of resources commensurate with its mandate. We call on Member States and other international donors to support, and coordinate with, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, including its regional and country offices, the institutes of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme network and requesting States in the provision of technical assistance to strengthen their capacity to prevent crime. 10. We acknowledge the leading role of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in providing technical assistance to facilitate the ratification and implementation of the international instruments related to the prevention and suppression of terrorism. 11. We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider strengthening the capacity of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to collect, analyse and disseminate accurate, reliable and comparable data on world crime and victimization trends and patterns, and we call on Member States to support the gathering and analysis of information and to consider designating focal points and provide information when requested to do so by the Commission. 12. We welcome the decision of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to engage in a thematic debate on protection against trafficking in cultural property and the recommendations made by the open-ended intergovernmental expert group on protection against trafficking in cultural property at its meeting held in Vienna from 24 to 26 November 2009, and invite the Commission to conduct appropriate follow-up, including, inter alia, exploring the need for guidelines for crime prevention with respect to trafficking in cultural property. Furthermore, we urge States that have not yet done so to develop effective legislation to prevent, prosecute and punish this crime in any of its forms and to strengthen international cooperation and technical assistance in this area, including the recovery and return of cultural property, bearing in mind the existing relevant international instruments, including the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, where appropriate. 13. We recognize the increasing risk of the convergence of transnational organized crime and illicit networks, many of which are new or evolving. We call upon Member States to cooperate, including through information-sharing, in an effort to address these evolving transnational criminal threats. 14. We acknowledge the challenge posed by emerging forms of crime that have a significant impact on the environment. We encourage Member States to strengthen their national crime prevention and criminal justice legislation, policies and practices in this area. We invite Member States to enhance international cooperation, technical assistance and the sharing of best practices in this area. We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, in coordination with the relevant United Nations bodies, to study the nature of the challenge and ways to deal with it effectively. 15. We express our serious concerns about the challenge posed by economic fraud and identity-related crime and their links to other criminal and, in some cases, terrorist activities. We therefore invite Member States to take appropriate legal measures to prevent, prosecute and punish economic fraud and identity-related crime and to continue to support the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in this area. Furthermore, Member States are encouraged to enhance international cooperation in this area, including through the exchange of relevant information and best practices, as well as through technical and legal assistance. 16. We recognize that international cooperation in criminal matters in accordance with international obligations and national laws is a cornerstone of the efforts of States to prevent, prosecute and punish crime, in particular in its transnational forms, and we encourage the continuation and reinforcement of such activities at all levels. 17. We call on those States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, welcome the establishment of its mechanism for the review of implementation, look forward to its effective implementation and acknowledge the work of the intergovernmental working groups on asset recovery and technical assistance. 18. We also call on those States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, and note with appreciation the decision of the General Assembly, in its resolution 64/179 of 18 December 2009, to hold in 2010 high-level meetings and a special treaty event. We also take note of ongoing initiatives aimed at exploring options regarding an appropriate and effective mechanism to assist the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime in the review of the implementation of the Convention. 19. We call upon Member States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the international instruments against terrorism, including its financing. We also call upon all States parties to use those instruments and the relevant United Nations resolutions to enhance international cooperation in countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and its financing, including evolving features of the latter. 20. We call on Member States, consistent with their international obligations, to establish or strengthen, as appropriate, central authorities fully empowered and equipped to deal with requests for international cooperation in criminal matters. In this perspective, regional legal cooperation networks could be supported. 21. Aware that gaps may exist in relation to international cooperation in criminal matters, we invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider reviewing this issue and explore the need for various means of addressing gaps that are identified. 22. We emphasize the need for the adoption of effective measures to implement the provisions on preventing, prosecuting and punishing money-laundering contained in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. We encourage Member States to develop strategies to combat money-laundering based on the provisions of these two Conventions. 23. We encourage Member States to consider developing strategies or policies to combat illicit capital flows and to curb the harmful effects of jurisdictions and territories uncooperative in tax matters. 24. We recognize the need to deny criminals and criminal organizations the proceeds of their crimes. We call on all Member States, within their national legal systems, to adopt effective mechanisms for the seizure, restraint and confiscation of proceeds of crime and to strengthen international cooperation to ensure effective and prompt asset recovery. We also call on States to preserve the value of seized and confiscated assets, including through disposal, where appropriate and possible, where there is a risk of their value diminishing. 25. Bearing in mind the need to reinforce criminal justice systems of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, we urge States parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the United Nations Convention against Corruption to fully implement the technical assistance provisions of each Convention, including by giving special consideration to contributing, in accordance with their national law and the provisions of those Conventions, a percentage of the proceeds of crime confiscated under each Convention to fund technical assistance through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 26. We are convinced of the importance of preventing youth crime, supporting the rehabilitation of young offenders and their reintegration into society, protecting child victims and witnesses, including efforts to prevent their revictimization, and addressing the needs of children of prisoners. We stress that such responses should take into account the human rights and best interests of children and youth, as called for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto, where applicable, and in other relevant United Nations standards and norms in juvenile justice, where appropriate. 27. We support the principle that the deprivation of liberty of children should be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time. We recommend the broader application, as appropriate, of alternatives to imprisonment, restorative justice and other relevant measures that foster the diversion of young offenders from the criminal justice system. 28. We call on States to develop and strengthen, where appropriate, legislation, policies and practices to punish all forms of crime that target children and youth, as well as for the protection of child victims and witnesses. 29. We encourage States to provide tailored training in an interdisciplinary approach to those involved in the administration of juvenile justice. 30. We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider requesting the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to design and provide to States specific technical assistance programmes to achieve these aims. 31. We call on civil society, including the media, to support the efforts to protect children and youth from exposure to content that may exacerbate violence and crime, particularly content depicting and glorifying acts of violence against women and children. 32. We are convinced of the need to accelerate efforts to fully implement the United Nations guidelines on crime prevention and the prevention components of existing conventions and other relevant international standards and norms. 33. We recognize that the development and adoption of crime prevention policies and their monitoring and evaluation are the responsibility of States. We believe that such efforts should be based on a participatory, collaborative and integrated approach that includes all relevant stakeholders including those from civil society. 34. We recognize the importance of strengthening public-private partnerships in preventing and countering crime in all its forms and manifestations. We are convinced that through the mutual and effective sharing of information, knowledge and experience and through joint and coordinated actions, Governments and businesses can develop, improve and implement measures to prevent, prosecute and punish crime, including emerging and changing challenges. 35. We stress the need for all States to have national and local action plans for crime prevention that take into account, inter alia, factors that place certain populations and places at higher risk of victimization and/or offending in a comprehensive, integrated and participatory manner, and for such plans to be based on the best available evidence and good practices. We stress that crime prevention should be considered an integral element of strategies to foster social and economic development in all States. 36. We urge Member States to consider adopting legislation, strategies and policies for the prevention of trafficking in persons, the prosecution of offenders and the protection of victims of trafficking, consistent with the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. We call on Member States, where applicable, in cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organizations, to follow a victim-centred approach with full respect for the human rights of the victims of trafficking, and to make better use of the tools developed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. 37. We urge Member States to consider adopting and implementing effective measures to prevent, prosecute and punish the smuggling of migrants and to ensure the rights of smuggled migrants, consistent with the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. In this context, we recommend that Member States, inter alia, undertake awareness-raising campaigns, in cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organizations. 38. We affirm our determination to eliminate violence against migrants, migrant workers and their families, and we call on Member States to adopt measures for preventing and addressing effectively cases of such violence and to ensure that those individuals receive humane and respectful treatment from States, regardless of their status. We also invite Member States to take immediate steps to incorporate into international crime prevention strategies and norms measures to prevent, prosecute and punish crimes involving violence against migrants, as well as violence associated with racism, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance. We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider this issue further in a comprehensive manner. 39. We note that the development of information and communications technologies and the increasing use of the Internet create new opportunities for offenders and facilitate the growth of crime. 40. We realize the vulnerability of children, and we call upon the private sector to promote and support efforts to prevent child sexual abuse and exploitation through the Internet. 41. We recommend that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, upon request, provide, in cooperation with Member States, relevant international organizations and the private sector, technical assistance and training to States to improve national legislation and build the capacity of national authorities, in order to deal with cybercrime, including the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of such crime in all its forms, and to enhance the security of computer networks. 42. We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider convening an open-ended intergovernmental expert group to conduct a comprehensive study of the problem of cybercrime and responses to it by Member States, the international community and the private sector, including the exchange of information on national legislation, best practices, technical assistance and international cooperation, with a view to examining options to strengthen existing and to propose new national and international legal or other responses to cybercrime. 43. We endeavour to take measures to promote wider education and awareness of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice to ensure a culture of respect for the rule of law. In this regard, we recognize the role of civil society and the media in cooperating with States in these efforts. We invite the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to continue to play a key role in the development and implementation of measures to promote and develop such a culture, in close coordination with other relevant United Nations entities. 44. We undertake to promote appropriate training of officials entrusted with upholding the rule of law, including correctional facility officers, law enforcement officials and the judiciary, as well as prosecutors and defence lawyers, in the use and application of those standards and norms. 45. We are concerned by urban crime and its impact on specific populations and places. We therefore recommend stronger coordination between security and social policies, with a view to addressing some of the root causes of urban violence. 46. We recognize that specific groups are particularly vulnerable to situations of urban crime, and we therefore recommend the adoption and implementation of civic intercultural programmes, where appropriate, aimed at combating racism and xenophobia, reducing the exclusion of minorities and migrants and thus promoting community cohesion. 47. We acknowledge the increasing links between transnational organized crime and drug trafficking in the context of the world drug problem. In this regard, we stress the urgent need for all States to enhance bilateral, regional and international cooperation to effectively counter the challenges posed by these links. 48. We recognize that the penitentiary system is one of the key components of the criminal justice system. We endeavour to use the United Nations standards and norms for the treatment of prisoners as a source of guidance in the development or updating of our national codes of penitentiary administration. 49. We invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider convening an open-ended intergovernmental expert group to exchange information on best practices, as well as national legislation and existing international law, and on the revision of existing United Nations standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners so that they reflect recent advances in correctional science and best practices, with a view to making recommendations to the Commission on possible next steps. 50. We welcome the draft United Nations rules for the treatment of women prisoners and non-custodial measures for women offenders. Taking note of the outcome and the recommendations of the meeting of the expert group to develop supplementary rules specific to the treatment of women in detention and in custodial and non-custodial settings, we recommend that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice consider them as a matter of priority for appropriate action. 51. We stress the need to reinforce alternatives to imprisonment, which may include community service, restorative justice and electronic monitoring and support rehabilitation and reintegration programmes, including those to correct offending behaviour, and educational and vocational programmes for prisoners. 52. We recommend that Member States endeavour to reduce pretrial detention, where appropriate, and promote increased access to justice and legal defence mechanisms. 53. We support effective and efficient follow-up of the outcomes of the United Nations congresses on crime prevention and criminal justice. We welcome the inclusion of a standing item on the agenda of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its annual sessions on this matter and on preparations for future congresses on crime prevention and criminal justice. 54. We welcome with appreciation the offer of the Government of Qatar to act as host to the Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, in 2015. 55. We express our profound gratitude to the people and Government of Brazil for their warm and generous hospitality and for the excellent facilities provided for the Twelfth Congress.
