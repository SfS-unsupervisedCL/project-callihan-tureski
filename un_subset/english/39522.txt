General Assembly Sixty-first session Agenda item 19 Question of Cyprus Security Council Sixty-second year Letter dated 21 February 2007 from the Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General In accordance with instructions received from my Government, I have the honour to refer to the letter dated 28 December 2006 from the Charg√© d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Turkey to the United Nations addressed to you (A/61/686-S/2006/1037), transmitting in the annex thereto a letter from the purported "deputy prime minister and minister for foreign affairs" of the legally invalid "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" on the alleged issue of "rearmament efforts" of the Republic of Cyprus. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus rejects the deliberate and preposterous fabrications contained in the aforementioned letter and considers them yet another by-proxy attempt by Turkey to divert attention from its own responsibilities as the occupying Power of approximately one third of the territory of another Member of the United Nations Organization. The aggressor accusing his victim of taking measures to defend itself constitutes in fact the ultimate expression of provocation. As stated in an earlier report of the Secretary-General (S/1995/1020), Turkey has transformed the occupied northern part of Cyprus into "one of the most densely militarized areas in the world". In that respect, it should be noted that, according to reliable sources and as evidenced by public statements of the Deputy Chief of the Turkish National Defence General Staff reported by CNN TURK on 8 December 2006, Turkey illegally stations in Cyprus the 11th Army Corps, consisting of 42,500 troops and comprising the following: :: The 39th Mechanized Infantry Division :: The 28th Mechanized Infantry Division :: The 14th Armoured Brigade :: The Mechanized Infantry Regiment of the Turkish Force in Cyprus :: The Special Forces Regiment :: The artillery regiment :: The naval component The Turkish occupation forces in Cyprus are armed with the latest technology in military equipment and weaponry, as follows: Main battle tanks 296 M48A5C (training) 9 M48A5T1/T2 287 Armoured personnel carriers/armoured infantry battle vehicles 677 Armoured personnel carriers -- M113 361 Armoured personnel carriers -- NUROL 90 Armoured infantry battle vehicles -- NUROL 126 Armoured personnel carriers -- Mortar trnsp. M106/NUROL 100 Artillery guns 212 (a) Towed 96 M-115 203 mm 12 M-59 155 mm 12 M-114A2 155 mm 36 M-101A1 105 mm 36 (b) Self-propelled 108 M-52T 155 mm 66 M-44T 155 mm 42 (c) Multiple rocket launchers T-122 mm 8 Anti-tank weapon systems 609 TOW (MSL) 48 MILAN (MSL) 72 M-40A1 106 mm 429 KONKURZ 60 Mortars 592 M-30 107 mm (4.2") MOR 142 HY-12 120 mm MOR 171 81 mm MOR 279 Air defence systems 299 RHIMENTAL/GAI DOI 20 mm 48 OERLIKON 35 mm 36 STINGER/REDEY 215 Warships 10 Coastal patrol vessels 9 Landing craft LCM 1 General purpose helicopters (Cougar AS-532) 2 It should be emphasized that, in 2005, Turkey completed a restructuring programme of its occupation forces in Cyprus, which was based on the upgrading of the infantry into mechanized infantry. Since then, Turkey has been constantly upgrading the military equipment and weaponry of its occupation forces in Cyprus through, inter alia, the replacement of M48A5T1 battle tanks with the technologically advanced M48A5T2, the acquisition of NUROL armoured personnel carriers and armoured fighting vehicles, the replacement of 105-mm towed artillery guns with 155-mm self-propelled guns, the increase in the number of 122-mm multiple rocket launchers, the upgrading of the light air defence artillery to squadrons and the forthcoming reinforcement of the coastal patrol with another two vessels. The militaristic approach of Turkey to the Cyprus problem constitutes a serious breach of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions, such as Security Council resolution 353 (1974), in which the Council called for "the withdrawal without delay from the Republic of Cyprus of foreign military personnel present otherwise than under the authority of international agreements"; General Assembly resolution 37/253 of 13 May 1983, in which the Assembly deplored the fact that "part of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus is still occupied by foreign forces" and considered "the withdrawal of all occupation forces from the Republic of Cyprus as an essential basis for a speedy and mutually acceptable solution of the problem of Cyprus"; and Security Council resolution 1251 (1999), in which the Council called for the reduction of all troops and armaments in Cyprus as a first step towards the withdrawal of non-Cypriot forces, in order to help restore confidence between the two sides. It is high time for the Government of Turkey to take heed of both the call of the international community and the will of Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots to build their common future on the basis of mutual trust, security and respect. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 19, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Andreas D. Mavroyiannis
