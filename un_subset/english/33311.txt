By its decision 2/COP.1, the COP, at its first session, adopted the Ffinancial Rrules of the COP, its subsidiary bodies and the Convention Ssecretariat (ICCD/COP(1)/11/Add.1). In accordance with paragraphs 9 and 10 of the financial rules, the Secretary-General of the United Nations established the Supplementary Fund. The present document seeks to provides information on the planned activities and related estimated funding requirements under these Fundsthis Fund. 2. Supplementary funding is sought for those activities in the secretariat's work programme for the next biennium for which sufficient funding would not be available under the core budget. The work programme is described in document ICCD/COP(7)/2/Add.1. 3. Accordingly, supplementary funding is sought for, inter alia, tasks relating to policy advice for implementation, including promotion of the synergistic implementation of the Convention and assistance in subregional and regional collaboration and coordination; preparation of the next review of the implementation of the UNCCDConvention, including the preparation of national reports in regions other than Africa; support to the coordination and organization of activities to celebrate and follow up to the 2006 International Year of Deserts and Desertification (IYDD); collaboration among non-governmental organiszations; knowledge management, including science and technology and provision of public information. II. SUPPLEMENTARY FUND A. Background information 4. The Parties may note that the costs presented for activities under the Supplementary Fund are preliminary estimates on the basis of expenditures of earlier corresponding activities. The actual supplementary funding requirements for each activity depend on a variety of factors, such as possible cost-sharing arrangements with partners, flight and subsistence rates at the time of a meeting to be organized, or consultancy fees vis-Ã -vis the level of expertise required. Consequently, the supplementary funding requirements presented in this document are only indicative. Table 1 below provides an overview of the estimated requirements by programme, but the requirements are not broken down by object of expenditure, or, in many cases by year of expenditure, due to the likelihood of substantive changes. More detailed estimates will be provided through separate documentation to be submitted to donors and other partners involved in the supported concerned activities during the biennium. 5. With regard to the relationship between the supplementary and core-funded activities, the Parties may also note that in some cases, supplementary funding will be needed to cover the major share of the activity in concernquestion. Such is the case for one of the major tasks of the secretariat, namely support to the process of the review of the implementation of the Convention, including assistance in the preparation of national reports. The related supplementary funding needs include support to the technical preparation of the report in the country Parties in concernconcerned, consultancy services to facilitate the compilation and analysis of the reports, as well asand the travel and logistical costs relating to the regional and global review meetings. Most often, however, supplementary funding is essential to complement the resources drawn from the core budget, so as to successfully complete the tasks set by the COP. In such cases, the core budget resources, particularly those relating to personnel costs, are used to undertake or supervise analytical work, contacts with relevant partners or collection and distribution of information. Other related functions, such as the organization of meetings, printing of reports and publications or use of specific external expertise, require supplementary funding. D Table 1.
