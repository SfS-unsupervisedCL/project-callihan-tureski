A Party that elected any or all activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, in the first commitment period shall continue to account for such activities in the second and subsequent commitment periods. Such ongoing accounting shall be incorporated into the calculation of its assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8.] During the second commitment period, a Party included in Annex I that selects any [or all] of the activities mentioned in paragraph 6 above [, in addition to those already selected for the first commitment period,] shall demonstrate that such activities have occurred since 1990 and are human-induced. A Party included in Annex I shall not account for emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, if these are already accounted for under Article 3, paragraph 3. For the second commitment period, accountable anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from [forest management,] revegetation, [devegetation,] cropland management, grazing land management, [[wetland] [peatland] management] under Article 3, paragraph 4, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period, less [five][X] times the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from these eligible activities [in the [base year] [base period] of that Party] [during 2012], while avoiding double accounting. (Forest management would be deleted from this paragraph if one of the other options identified below were adopted). [The year 2012 shall be used as the reference year, whether or not the Party included in Annex I elected to account for any or all of those elected activities in the first commitment period.] [9 bis. For the second commitment period, accountable anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources resulting from forest biomass decline shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks associated with forest biomass decline in the commitment period, less five times the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from forest biomass decline during 2012, while avoiding double accounting. The year 2012 shall be used as the reference year, whether or not the Party included in Annex I elected to account for any or all of those elected activities in the first commitment period.] [9 ter. If a Party elected a voluntary land use, land-use change and forestry activity and it was a net sink in the base year, the Party may incur zero accountable anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks for that activity if the Party provides information to demonstrate that for the land subject to the activity, changes in land management practices since the base year have not reversed removals by sinks or increased emissions. The Party would provide the information in their national inventory and it will be subject to review.] [9 quater. Parties [should] include emissions and removals from elected activities in their baseline towards the determination of their assigned amount for the [second] commitment period; and [should] include in their accounts emissions and removals from elected activities in the [second] commitment period.] [Option 1: For the second commitment period, a Party included in Annex I that incurs a net source of emissions under the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 3, may account for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in areas under forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, up to a level that is equal to the net source of emissions under the provisions of Article 3, paragraph 3, but not greater than 9.0 megatonnes of carbon times five, if the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks [in the managed forest] [resulting from forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4,] since 1990 is equal to, or larger than, the net source of emissions incurred under Article 3, paragraph 3.] [Option 2: Delete the paragraph] Accounting for forest management [Option 1 (caps): For the second commitment period [only], additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party3resulting from forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, [after the application of paragraph 10 above] and resulting from forest management project activities undertaken under Article 6 shall not exceed the value inscribed in the appendix[4]6below, times [five][x].] [Option 2 (discount factor/s):] [Option 2.1: 11. For the second commitment period [only], additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party55resulting from forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, [after the application of paragraph 10 above] and resulting from forest management project activities undertaken under Article 6, shall be subject to the application of a [X per cent] discount factor [as inscribed in the appendix below].] [Option 2.2: 11. For the second commitment period [only], a discount rate of [X] per cent shall be applied during the accounting phase to all carbon credits and carbon debits, which result from activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, and from forest management under Article 6 beginning with the onset of the second and subsequent commitment periods.] [Option 3 (bar)6: 11. For the second commitment period, accountable anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from [forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4,] [forest land]7 shall be: Option 3.1 (BAR including band from 0 to BAR. Only removals by sinks above BAR or net-emissions are accounted for, values between 0 and BAR are neither credited nor debited, values below 0 are debited): (a) Where a Party is reporting net removals in the commitment period larger than [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party: equal to the net removals in the commitment period, less [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party; (b) Where a Party is reporting in the commitment period net removals smaller than [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that party: equal to zero; and (c) Where a Party is reporting a net emission in the commitment period: equal to the net emission in the commitment period. Option 3.2 (BAR including band from BAR - X per cent to BAR+X per cent. Values above BAR+X per cent are credited, values below BAR - X per cent are debited, and values between BAR - X per cent and BAR+X per cent are neither credited nor debited): (a) Where a Party is reporting net removals or net emissions in the commitment period larger than [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party plus X [per cent8] [tonnes], equal to the net removals or net emissions in the commitment period, less [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party plus X [per cent] [tonnes]; and (b) Where a Party is reporting net removals or net emissions in the commitment period smaller than [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party minus X [per cent] [tonnes], equal to net removals or net emissions in the commitment period less [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party minus X [per cent] [tonnes]; and (c) Where a Party is reporting net removals or net emissions in the commitment period smaller than [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party plus X [per cent] [tonnes] and larger than the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party minus X [per cent] [tonnes], equal to zero. Option 3.3 (BAR only; no band - pure net-net compared with BAR level): Net emissions or net removals in the commitment period less [five] [x] times the reference level inscribed in Annex [F] for that Party.] [Option 4 (forward-looking baseline): 11. For the second commitment period, additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party resulting from forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, shall be determined as forest management greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period, after the application of paragraph 11 quater below, less forest management reference level greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period, defined as per paragraphs 11 bis and 11 ter below. 11 bis. A Party that has elected to account for forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, shall determine the forest management reference level greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period in accordance with (reference to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guidelines and guidance) and considering: (a) Current forest inventory information; (b) Actions already taken to reduce emissions and increase removals; (c) Historical data and forest management activities; (d) Business-as-usual forest management plans; (e) The relationship between (c) and (d). 11 ter. A Party that has elected to account for forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, shall report: (a) The forest management reference level greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period determined in accordance with paragraph 11 bis above; (b) A description and justification of the reference level and the information used to establish it, including how the Party has considered the elements mentioned in paragraph 11 bis above. The information reported under this paragraph will be subject to expert review. 11 quater. A Party that has elected to account for forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, may choose to exclude non-anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from natural disturbances from the estimates of forest management emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period if transparent and verifiable information is provided as per paragraph 11 quinquies below that the natural disturbances and associated greenhouse emissions by sources and removals by sinks are non-anthropogenic and not direct human-induced. 11 quinquies. When a Party chooses to exclude from its accounting for forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, the non-anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from natural disturbances, as described in paragraph 11 quater above, the national inventory system shall ensure that areas of land subject to these natural disturbances are identifiable, and that information about these areas and natural disturbances is provided as described in paragraph 19 bis below [(Option 4)]. This information will be subject to expert review.] [A Party may request the Conference of the Parties to reconsider its numerical values as contained in paragraph 10 above and in the appendix to paragraph 11 above [(Option 1)], with a view to the Conference of the Parties recommending a decision for adoption to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, no later than two years prior to the beginning of the first commitment period. Such a reconsideration shall be based upon country-specific data and the elements of guidance and consideration in the footnote to paragraph 11 above [(Option 1)]. These shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with relevant decisions related to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol, and in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, any future elaboration of these guidelines, or parts of them, and any good practice guidance on land use, land-use change and forestry in accordance with the relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties. (Consider deletion, due to specific need for the first commitment period.)] Article 129 Note: Further discussion on how to address non-permanence is needed. Proposals under consideration are reflected in document FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/INF.2. The eligibility of land use, land-use change and forestry project activities under Article 12 is [Option 1: limited to afforestation and reforestation.] [Option 2: Expand the list of activities (to be decided at a later date)] [13 bis. For afforestation and reforestation project activities to be eligible under Article 12 the land must have been non-forested in 1990 and remain non-forested until the start of the second commitment period. Land that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989 and which has subsequently been allowed to revegetate or reforest prior to the start of the second commitment period and subsequently devegetated or deforested prior to the second commitment period shall not be eligible under Article 12.] [13 ter. Land that was natural grassland or shrubland in 1990 shall not be eligible under Article 12.] [For the second commitment period, the total of additions to a Party's assigned amount resulting from eligible land use, land-use change and forestry project activities under Article 12 shall not exceed [one] [x] per cent of base year emissions of that Party, times [five][X].] [The treatment of land use, land-use change and forestry project activities under Article 12 in future commitment periods shall be decided as part of the negotiations on the third commitment period.] (This paragraph may need further amendment; the proposal for paragraph 15 bis is related.) [15 bis. Accounting for afforestation and reforestation project activities under Article 12 as described in decision 19/CP.9 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, for the second and subsequent commitment periods.] General Each Party included in Annex I shall, for the purposes of applying the definition of "forest" as contained in paragraph 1 (a) above, select a single minimum tree crown cover value between 10 and 30 per cent, a single minimum land area value between 0.05 and 1 hectare and a single minimum tree height value between 2 and 5 metres. The selection of a Party shall be fixed for the duration of the second [and subsequent] commitment [period] [periods]. The selection shall be included as an integral part of its report to enable the calculation of its assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, in accordance with decision 19/CP.7, and shall include the values for tree crown cover, tree height and the minimum land area. Each Party shall justify in its reporting that such values are consistent with the [definition used in the first commitment period] [information that has historically been reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations or other international bodies,] and if they differ, explain why and how such values were chosen [and what implications it may have on the consistency of the accounting].] 16. Each Party included in Annex I shall, for the purpose of applying the definition of "forest" as contained in paragraph 1 (a) above, apply the definition of forest selected in the first commitment period. 16 bis. Those Parties included in Annex I that did not select a definition of forest for the first commitment period shall, for the purpose of applying the definition of "forest" as contained in paragraph 1 (a) above, select a single minimum tree crown cover value of between 10 and 30 per cent, a single minimum land area value of between 0.05 and 1 hectare and a single minimum tree height value of between 2 and 5 metres. 16 ter. The selection by a Party of a definition of "forest" shall be fixed for the duration of the second commitment [period]. The selection shall be included as an integral part of the Party's report to enable the calculation of its assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, in accordance with decision 19/CP.7, and shall include the values for tree crown cover, tree height and minimum land area. Each Party shall justify in its reporting, that such values are consistent with the information that has historically been reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations or other international bodies, and if they differ, explain why and how such values were chosen.] For the second commitment period, and subject to other provisions in this annex, the additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions during the period [1 January 2013] to, [31 December [YY]] resulting from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, and forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, that have taken place since 1 January 1990. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink of greenhouse gases, this value shall be added to the assigned amount of that Party. Where the result of this calculation is a net source of greenhouse gas emissions, this value shall be subtracted from the assigned amount of that Party. (This paragraph may need to be revised to be consistent with e.g. paragraphs 9 and 11.) Accounting of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, shall begin with the onset of the activity or the beginning of the commitment period, whichever comes later. [Once land is accounted for under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources from and removals by sinks on this land must be accounted for throughout subsequent and contiguous commitment periods.] (This paragraph will need to be revised if activities in Article 3, paragraph 4, continue to be electable.) Natural disturbances 19 bis. A Party included in Annex I may choose to carry over to the next commitment period(s) the non-anthropogenic emissions resulting from natural disturbances.] 19 bis. A Party included in Annex I that has elected to account for any or all elected activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, and which has suffered a force majeure during the second commitment period or subsequent commitment periods, may seek approval from the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to seek a time out and hence eliminate such land from the accounting system for a period of time until the carbon stocks on the explicitly geo-referenced land are returned to the state prior to the force majeure. 19 ter. In deciding whether to approve a time out for a Party, the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol shall take into consideration the following aspects: whether the force majeure fits the definition as prescribed in this decision; how the force majeure was not human-induced; whether the Party can provide verifiable geo-referenced information on the land subject to the force majeure; whether the Party can provide a verifiable estimate of the carbon stocks on the affected land immediately prior to the force majeure; whether the Party has provided an estimate of the time for the time out; and whether the Party is able to maintain an ongoing inventory and assessment of the recovery of carbon stocks until the end of the time out period. 19 quater. Once land has been timed out it shall continue to be reported and accounted for during and beyond the second commitment period until such time as the land has recovered the carbon stocks to the state prior to the force majeure.] [Option 3: 19 bis. A Party included in Annex I where a force majeure has occurred during the second or subsequent commitment periods, affecting carbon stocks in forests under Article 3, paragraph 3, and [if elected] [forest management] [other activities] under Article 3, paragraph 4, may Option 3.1: request [a review process10], at the end of the commitment period, for the emissions and subsequent removals, up to the levels prior to the extraordinary event, resulting from the event classified as force majeure, to be removed from accounting. The carbon stocks resulting from any land-use changes that occur in those areas shall not be removed from accounting and the corresponding emissions shall be fully accounted for. Option 3.2: choose to carry over to the next commitment period(s) the non-anthropogenic emissions resulting from the event classified as force majeure. 19 ter. In the application of force majeure a Party shall provide information to the expert review team: On all areas subject to the application of force majeure, including the date(s) and nature of the event(s); Proving that the level of emissions resulting from the force majeure is [X per cent] higher than the total national emissions in the commitment period; Showing that the occurrence or severity of the force majeure was not materially influenced by the Party; On actions undertaken to reduce the consequences of the force majeure.] [Option 4: 19 bis. When a Party chooses to exclude from its accounting the non-anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from natural disturbances, it must report information on the natural disturbances in its national inventory report including a demonstration that the natural disturbance events and the associated emissions and removals are non-anthropogenic and not direct human-induced. This shall include, inter alia: Information that identifies the location, cause and scale of impact of the natural disturbance events; Information that demonstrates that no land-use change has followed the natural disturbance events; Information on the emissions and removals that would be excluded; Information that demonstrates that the excluded emissions and removals are non-anthropogenic and not direct human-induced; Information that demonstrates efforts to rehabilitate forest affected by natural disturbances; Information that demonstrates efforts to manage or control natural disturbances. This information will be subject to expert review.] [Option 5: 19 bis. The land sector is also influenced by non-anthropogenic emissions and removals and legacy effects of pre-1990 activities that need to be identified and quantified to allow exclusion from accounting. These are due to: Natural disturbance; Inter-annual variability; The age structure of forests. 19 ter. (Text taken from document FCCC/KP/AWG/2009/8, annex II, paragraph 21 bis; non-textual language): Removing natural disturbance impacts is optional, the information that needs to be provided about natural disturbance events, and the need for information demonstrating that the emissions and removals are non-anthropogenic and not direct human-induced. The following issues [could][should] be considered in developing further the modalities: A Party would have the option of excluding the impact of natural disturbances from its accounting. Text would be needed on how emissions and subsequent removals resulting from natural disturbances would be removed from the accounting; Principles will be needed to guide Parties in reporting on emissions and subsequent removals resulting from natural disturbance events on Article 3, paragraph 3, or Article 3, paragraph 4, lands. This may include provision of information on the natural disturbances in its national inventory report including a demonstration that the natural disturbance events and the associated emissions and removals are non-anthropogenic and not direct human-induced. This may include, inter alia: Information that demonstrates that the excluded emissions and removals are non-anthropogenic; Information on the carbon stocks prior to the natural disturbance events; Information on the monitoring and the recovery of the carbon stocks following the natural disturbance event; The information provided would be subject to review. Guidance would need to be provided to support the review process. Parties may consider formulating a request to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to assist in defining methodological approaches related to how natural disturbance emissions and removals are excluded, and related to demonstrating that the natural disturbance events and the associated emissions and removals are non-anthropogenic and not direct human-induced. This would include methodological approaches already tabled. 19 quater. Annual reporting should report emissions estimates in a manner that more clearly reflects anthropogenic trends in land use, land-use change and forestry activities. Parties that use annual data to produce emissions estimates can report using a rolling average of annual greenhouse gas emissions estimates for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector.] 19 quinquies. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories will be reviewed in consideration of the post-2012 accounting framework agreed by the Parties for the land sector.] National inventory systems under Article 5, paragraph 1, shall ensure that [information on the] areas of land subject to land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, [are identifiable, and information about these areas] should be provided by each Party included in Annex I in their national inventories in accordance with Article 7. Such information will be reviewed in accordance with Article 8. 21. Each Party included in Annex I shall account for all changes in the following carbon pools: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, [and] soil organic carbon [and harvested wood products]. A Party may choose not to account for a given pool in a commitment period, if transparent and verifiable information is provided that the pool is not a source. Harvested wood products 21 bis. Carbon in wood removed from forests accounted for under the Kyoto Protocol under Article[s] 3 [6 and 12] shall be accounted for on the basis of default instantaneous oxidation or on the basis of estimates of when emissions occur, provided that verifiable and transparent data are available. 21 ter. When accounting is on the basis of estimates of when emissions occur, it shall be based on changes in the harvested wood products pool consumed and produced domestically. [Parties may also choose to account for carbon in exported harvested wood products originating from domestic harvest based on changes in the exported harvested wood products pool.] 21 quater. Estimates of net emissions from harvested wood products shall specify product categories and underlying assumptions for both domestic and export markets [but shall not include paper, pulp, fuel wood or other short-lived wood products]. [Harvested wood products in solid waste disposal sites shall not be accounted for.] 21 quinquies. Where exported wood is accounted for, such estimates shall be reported separately for each country to which the harvested wood products are exported. 21 sexies. Accounting shall be confined to harvested wood products11 originating from harvested forest for which emissions and removals have been included in the accounting of the Party, and in the same way as for other pools. 21 septies. [Where a ratio is applied for accounting of emissions and removals from forest management it shall also apply to the harvested wood products pool.] 21 octies. [Emissions that occur during the commitment period12 from the harvested wood pool arising from wood harvested prior to 31 December 2007 shall also be accounted for, using the same procedure as above.]] 21 bis. As of the second commitment period a Party may choose to account for long-lived harvested wood products, provided that verifiable data on amounts, carbon content, and decay rates and/or emissions from harvested wood products are available. 21 ter. A country that has elected to account for harvested wood products shall account for the amount of carbon in the harvested wood products produced in that country and either add the carbon contained in the net import of harvested wood products or subtract the carbon contained in the net export of harvested wood products. 21 quater. Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 21 ter above, a country that has elected to account for harvested wood products shall account as emissions from sources within its jurisdiction any harvested wood products that are imported from Parties not included in Annex I unless the wood was harvested from forests that are currently involved in activities under Article 12. 21 quinquies. Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph x above, a country that has elected to account for harvested wood products may account for harvested wood products that it has exported to another Annex I Party which does not account for harvested wood products by transferring it to a separate pool of harvested wood products that are stored outside of the exporting country, provided that the wood was produced by the exporting country and that verifiable decay rates for those pools are available.] 21 bis. A Party included in Annex I may choose to account for the use harvested wood products for harvested wood products derived from forests subject to reforestation activities since 1 January 1990 in the country of that Party and which have subsequently been subject to forest biomass decline activities during the commitment period. 21 ter. A Party included in Annex I may also choose to account for the use of harvested wood products for such products derived from elected forest management activities if so elected in the first commitment period or elected forest management activities in the second commitment period. 21 quater. Notwithstanding the provisions included in paragraph x below, imported harvested wood products from another country shall not enter the accounting system. 21 quinquies. The calculation of carbon stock changes for the purpose of accounting for harvested wood products, if so elected, on land that is to be accounted for under either reforested land or elected forest management land shall be based on the total increment of carbon stock growth in the eligible forest minus any changes in soil carbon, minus carbon stocks left over from timber harvest activities, minus carbon stocks from any wood residues from wood mills, minus carbon stocks from wood products used for the purposes of paper, wood chips or other short-lived wood products, minus a carbon release estimate of harvested wood products produced and then destroyed during the commitment period, times a conversion factor from carbon to carbon dioxide equivalent. 21 sexies. Harvested wood products derived from deforestation shall be accounted for on the basis that all carbon biomass deforested is considered to have oxidized in the year when the deforestation took place and shall be accounted for as an emission. All other biomass emissions, such as loss of soil carbon, human-induced fires, etc., associated with the deforestation activity shall be accounted for as an emission. 21 septies. Once a harvested wood product leaves the Party included in Annex I where the forest product was grown, the carbon stocks included in the product shall be accounted for as an emission.] [Non-Annex I Party harvested wood products 21 octies. A Party included in Annex I shall account for importing of harvested wood products that have originated from a Party not included in Annex I in the manner prescribed in paragraphs 21 novies to 21 decies below. 21 novies. Carbon stocks included in wood products that have been imported into a Party included in Annex I and originated in a Party not included in Annex I as a result of deforestation or forest degradation activities in a Party not included in Annex I shall be accounted for as an emission in the importing Party included in Annex I. 21 decies. Notwithstanding paragraph 21 novies above, a Party included in Annex I shall not have to account for emissions from wood products that have been imported into its country and originated in a Party not included in Annex I, if it can be verified that such wood products have been derived from certified sustainable forest management practices. 21 undecies. All certified sustainable forest management practices shall be approved by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, based on recommendations from the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, and shall be kept in a registry maintained by the secretariat. 21 duodecies. When making recommendations for the approval of certified sustainable forest management practices, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice shall take into full consideration the following criteria: (a) The practices do not adversely affect indigenous peoples or local communities; (b) The practices do not adversely affect biological diversity; (c) The practices are legal, as determined by the laws of the country of origin; (d) Adequate law enforcement capabilities are in place; (e) The practices lead to a long-term, sustainable supply of wood products; (f) The practices are independently monitored; (g) The practices do not lead to a displacement of emissions to another location, whether within the country of origin or elsewhere.] [21 ter deces. Insert a provision for limiting the use of the land use, land-use change and forestry sector for compliance with commitments of Annex I Parties.] Option B13 (Definitions of afforestation and reforestation moved to decision 5/CMP.1) 1. The following definitions shall apply: "Forest" is a minimum area of land of 0.05 - 1.0 hectares with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10 - 30 per cent with trees with the potential to reach a minimum height of 2 - 5 metres at maturity in situ. A forest may consist of either closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground or open forest. Young natural stands and all plantations which have yet to reach a crown density of 10 - 30 per cent or tree height of 2 - 5 metres are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention such as harvesting or natural causes but which are expected to revert to forest; "Forest land" includes all land with woody vegetation which falls under the definition of forest; "Cropland" includes all arable and tillage land as well as agroforestry systems which do not fall under the category of forest land; "Grassland" includes [all] rangeland and pasture land as well as agroforestry systems which do not fall under the categories of forest land and cropland; "Wetlands" includes land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the year, such as peatland, and which does not fall under the forest land, cropland, grassland or settlements categories; "Settlements" includes all developed land, including transportation infrastructure and human settlements of any size, which does not fall under the forest land, cropland, grassland or wetlands categories; "Other land" includes bare soil, rock, ice and all land areas which do not fall under the forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands or settlements categories. [(h) Option 1: "Force majeure" means, for the purposes of this decision, an extraordinary event or circumstances beyond the control of Parties. Option 2: "Expected net emissions" is the algebraic sum of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of the greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol from the sectors which are expected to be accounted for during the relevant commitment period; it is expressed in gigagrams of carbon dioxide equivalent.] Accounting rules for greenhouse gas emissions and removals 2. Option 1: For the purpose of accounting greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry, a Party shall account for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks on forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands and settlements as well as greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land-use changes from the land-use categories forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands or settlements to any other land-use category. Option 2: For the purpose of accounting greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry, a Party shall account for those anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks [on forest land and] from land-use changes occurring from the forest land category to other land-use categories and vice versa, and [for the second commitment period [only]] may account for those anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks on [forest land,] cropland, grassland, wetlands and settlements as well as greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land-use changes occurring from cropland, grassland, wetlands or settlements to any other land-use category. [Option 2 addendum: Where anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks on forest land are not accounted for, the accounted anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks from the land use, land-use change and forestry sector shall be adjusted for the displaced emissions. Displaced emissions are the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources that occur on forest lands and are the consequence of reductions in emissions reported under an accounted category, as in the case of biomass fuel combustion in the energy sector. A similar provision shall be included under Option A of this annex to cope with no or partial accounting of forest land: Where anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks on forest land are not completely accounted for because either no election of forest management has taken place or the forest management activity does not cover the whole national area of forest land, anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks from land use, land-use change and forestry activities shall be adjusted for displacement of emissions. Displaced emissions are the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources which occur on forest land and are the consequence of a reduction in emissions reported under an accounted category, as in the case of biomass fuel combustion in the energy sector.] 3. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry shall be estimated using the guidance provided in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories or any further guidelines for greenhouse gas inventories adopted by [the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol] [Parties] for this purpose. 4. For the purpose of accounting, greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use change occurring on forest land, cropland, grassland, wetland or settlement during the commitment period shall be reported under the land category to which the land has been converted. 5. For the second commitment period, accountable anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry shall be equal to the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period, less [[five] [X] times] the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks [that take place on [forest land], cropland, grassland, wetlands and settlements in the [base year] [base period]] [reported as the reference level] of that Party, while avoiding double accounting. 6. For the second commitment period [only], additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party14 resulting from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks occurring on forest land shall: Option A: Be subject to the application of a [x per cent] discount factor. Option B: Not exceed the value inscribed in the appendix below, times [five] [X]. Option C: (Bar approach/Reference level - text included under Option A of this annex is applied here.) 7. For the second commitment period, and subject to other provisions in this annex, the additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, shall be equal to the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions during the period [1 January 2013 to] [31 December [YY]] occurring on forest land. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink of greenhouse gases, this value shall be added to the assigned amount of that Party. Where the result of this calculation is a net source of greenhouse gas emissions, this value shall be subtracted from the assigned amount of that Party. (This paragraph may need to be revised to make it consistent with paragraphs 5 and 6 above.) 5. Any Party included in Annex I should apply as the reference level for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector the aggregate carbon dioxide equivalent anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks estimated for the period 20XX - 20XX. Taking into account national circumstances, any Party included in Annex I may apply a different reference level for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector from that selected in Article 3, paragraph 3, (as amended)15 of the Kyoto Protocol. To do so, the Party shall submit, no later than two years before the start of the relevant commitment period, the proposed values and relevant elements in support of such a deviance. The submission should be made together with the Party's annual greenhouse gases inventory submission. Submitted data should be subject to the review procedure, and the agreed reference level should be part of the Party's annual review report on its greenhouse gas inventory. Article 12 (Text included under Option A of this annex is applied here.) 8. (Same as Option A, paragraph 16) 9. (Same as Option A, paragraph 19) 10. (Same as Option A, paragraph 20) 11. Option 1: (Same as Option A, paragraph 21) Option 2: Each Party included in Annex I shall account for all changes in the following carbon pools: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon and harvested wood products. A Party may choose not to account for a given pool in a commitment period if transparent and verifiable information is provided to show that the exclusion of that pool does not result in discounting a debit.16 (The same text shall also be included under Option A of this annex.) [Option I: 12. A Party included in Annex I in which a force majeure has occurred during the second or subsequent commitment periods, affecting carbon stocks on forest land [and [, if elected,] other land categories], may Option 1: request [a review process17], at the end of the commitment period, for the emissions and subsequent removals up to the levels prior to the event classified as force majeure to be removed from accounting. The carbon stocks resulting from any land use changes that occur in those areas shall not be removed from accounting and the corresponding emissions shall be fully accounted for. Option 2: choose to carry over to the next commitment period(s) the non-anthropogenic emissions resulting from the event classified as force majeure. 13. (Same as Option A, paragraph 19)] [Option II: 12. The Parties included in Annex I shall submit a proposed value for the expected net emissions of the land use, land-use change and forestry sector for the following commitment period, together with data which support the selected values. The values and data shall be submitted to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting to the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol before an agreement is reached on the quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments for the commitment period to which the data refer. 13. Together with the list of quantified emission limitation or reduction commitments for Parties inscribed in Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol, an appendix to this annex containing a list of expected net emissions from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector for each Party inscribed in Annex B shall be adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The value for the expected net emissions shall be the algebraic sum of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks from the land use, land-use change and forestry sector of the greenhouse gases listed in Annex A that are expected to be accounted for during the commitment period to which it is applied; the value shall be expressed in gigagrams of carbon dioxide equivalent.] 14. At the end of the commitment period, any Party included in Annex I shall calculate the difference between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions during the period 1 January 2013 to 31 December 20XX resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry sector the expected net emissions of that Party inscribed in the appendix to this annex. Where the result of this calculation is a positive value, this value shall be subtracted from the accounted anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks from the land use, land-use change and forestry sector of that Party; moreover, an equivalent amount shall be added to the accounted anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks from the land use, land-use change and forestry sector in the following commitment period. 15. (Text included under Option A for harvested wood products is applied here.) [16. Insert a provision for limiting the use of the land use, land-use change and forestry sector for compliance with commitments of Annex I Parties.] Annex III Compilation of proposals for elements of draft decisions of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gases, sectors and source categories; common metrics to calculate the carbon dioxide equivalence of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks; and other methodological issues In relation to greenhouse gases, sectors and source categories Reaffirms that the actual emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride, including new species identified by the Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change in its Fourth Assessment Report, should be estimated, where data are available, and used for the reporting of emissions. Provisions of the Kyoto Protocol relating to coverage of greenhouse gases and sectors remain unchanged. In relation to common metrics to calculate the carbon dioxide equivalence of emissions by sources and removals by sinks Decides that for the purposes of this agreement, the global warming potentials used to calculate the carbon dioxide equivalence of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol shall be those provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Fourth Assessment Report based on the effects of the greenhouse gases over a 100-year time horizon. Any revision to a global warming potential by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change subsequent to the Fourth Assessment Report or revisions of the approach to calculate carbon dioxide equivalence shall apply only to commitments under Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol in respect of any commitment period adopted subsequent to that revision. [Those global warming potentials so agreed would be used to determine fulfilment of mitigation commitments for the second commitment period.] Provisions of the Kyoto Protocol relating to global warming potentials remain unchanged until the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice concludes its consideration of this matter and, if appropriate, recommends a draft decision adopting global temperature potentials as a common metric. Provisions of the Kyoto Protocol relating to global warming potentials remain unchanged for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Decides that starting with the second commitment period, the methodologies for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol shall be consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol shall review the use of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines before the start of each subsequent commitment period. Time series of emissions by sources and removals by sinks including base year emissions shall be recalculated using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines prior to the start of the second commitment period. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties shall revise the technical guidance for adjustments at its [...] session, taking into account the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Notes: Additional methodological guidance for the estimation of emissions by sources and removals by sinks might be required for Article 3, paragraph 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol, depending on the results of the discussions on land use, land-use change and forestry. Methodologies for the estimation of these activities are not available in the 2006 IPCC guidelines. A decision text should further specify the process and timing for the necessary recalculations due to the application of the new guidelines prior to the start of the second commitment period. Decides that starting with the second commitment period, the methodologies for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol shall be consistent with those included in the "Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories", as revised by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice through its work programme launched in 2010, and subsequently agreed by the Conference of the Parties at its [...] session, following and limited by the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol shall develop further guidance to confine the inventory information submitted under the Convention to the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above. Time series of emissions by sources and removals by sinks including base year emissions shall be recalculated at the start of the second commitment period. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol shall revise the technical guidance for adjustments at its [...] session. Recalling that Article 5, paragraph 2 [bis],1 of the Kyoto Protocol provides inter alia that, for the second commitment period, methodologies for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol shall be those agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol no later than its [XX] session, based on the work of, inter alia, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and advice provided by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, Recalling further that the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, at its thirtieth session, agreed to launch a work programme in 2010 to revise the "Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories (hereinafter referred to as the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories)" and address the methodological issues related to reporting when using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, with a view to recommending revised UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for adoption by the Conference of the Parties, 4 bis. Decides that, pursuant to Article 5, paragraph 2 [bis], of the Kyoto Protocol, Parties should use methodologies for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol that are consistent with those indicated in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, as revised by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice through its work programme launched in 2010, and subsequently agreed by the Conference of the Parties. The time series of emissions by sources and removals by sinks including base year emissions should be recalculated at the start of the second commitment period. The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol should revise the technical guidance for adjustments at its [...] session. In relation to cross-cutting issues 5. Notes the need to revise the "Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories", contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2006/9, to implement the provisions pursuant to paragraphs 1 - 3 above. 6. Invites the Conference of the Parties to revise the guidelines referred to in paragraph 5 above. 7. Requests the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice to prepare, for adoption by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its eighth session (2012), draft decisions incorporating the provisions pursuant to paragraphs 1 - 3 above into the following decisions: Decision 13/CMP.1 on the modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts under Article 7, paragraph 4 of the Kyoto Protocol; Decision 14/CMP.1 on a standard electronic format for reporting Kyoto Protocol units; Decision 15/CMP.1 on the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol; Decision 19/CMP.1 on the guidelines for national systems under Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Kyoto Protocol; Decision 21/CMP.1 on issues relating to adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Kyoto Protocol; Decision 22/CMP.1 on the guidelines for review under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol; Decision 6/CMP.3 on good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol. Annex IV Compilation of proposals for elements of draft decisions of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol on other issues In relation to a mid-commitment-period assessment and review process Decides that the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol shall undertake and conclude, no later than 31 December 2015, an assessment and review of efforts made to meet quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments agreed for the second commitment period in order to assess progress and determine whether additional measures are needed, based on best available scientific information, to meet the ultimate objective of the Convention, with a view to enabling the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to specify any additional measures to be taken by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention with a commitment inscribed in Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol, which may include more stringent quantitative emission limitation and reduction commitments.1 Decides that, at its sixteenth session, the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol shall initiate consideration of appropriate and effective procedures and mechanisms to determine and address cases of non-compliance with the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, in accordance with the relevant provisions in Article X,2 including financial penalties to be determined on the basis of cause, type, degree and frequency of non-compliance. Resources raised from financial penalties should be used to assist developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting the costs of adaptation. In relation to decision 14/CP.7 The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, Recalling decisions 1/CP.3, paragraph 5 (d), and 14/CP.7 on impact of single projects on emissions in the commitment period, Recalling also its decisions 7/CMP.3 and 8/CMP.3, Recognizing the importance of renewable energy in meeting the objective of the Convention, 1. Decides that, the provisions of decision 14/CP.7, adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its seventh session, shall continue to apply for the second commitment period with the conditions detailed therein.
