99-03311 (E) 120299 United Nations A/C.5/53/53 General Assembly Distr.: General 9 February 1999 Original: English Fifty-third session Fifth Committee Agenda items 30, 112 and 113 United Nations reform: measures and proposals Review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations Programme budget for the biennium 1998â€“1999 Impact of the implementation of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures Note by the Secretary-General 1. The General Assembly, in its decision 53/456 of 18 December 1998, decided to resume its consideration of the question of the impact of pilot projects on budgetary practices and procedures at its resumed fifty-third session, and requested the Secretary-General to submit to it at that session the additional information recommended by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.1 2. The Department of Management informed the Fifth Committee, at its 39th meeting, that it was sending an evaluation mission to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) to determine progress made in the implementation of the pilot project on delegation of authority. This mission was initially planned for early 1999. The proposed mission has now been scheduled for March/April 1999 in order to accommodate the conflicting work demands and the availability of counterpart staff in ECLAC. Accordingly, the report will be finalized and issued in May 1999. The revised timing will allow the Secretariat to take into account the results of the deliberations of the Fifth Committee on human resources management during the first part of the resumed fifty-third session of the General Assembly. A/C.5/53/53 3. The Secretary-General therefore suggests that the report, having benefited from the views of the Fifth Committee on human resources management and the on-site evaluation mission, be submitted to the General Assembly at the second part of its resumed fifty-third session.
