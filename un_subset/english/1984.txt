UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL A/52/1004 S/1998/721 6 August 1998 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH GENERAL ASSEMBLY SECURITY COUNCIL Fifty-second session Fifty-third year Agenda item 61 QUESTION OF CYPRUS Letter dated 4 August 1998 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Cyprus to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Upon instructions from my Government, and further to our letter dated 27 July 1998 (A/52/996-S/1998/696), I have the honour to draw your attention to new violations of the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus and of the flight information region of Nicosia by military aircraft of the Turkish Air Force, recorded today, 4 August 1998. Two Turkish military aircraft RF-4 entered the northern Nicosia flight information region in violation of international air traffic regulations and of the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus flying over the area of Kormakiti and the cape of Apostle Andreas, returning then to the Ankara flight information region. As stated in our previous letters, such unauthorized intrusions into the Nicosia flight information region and the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus are in violation of international air traffic rules and, at the same time, they are in contravention with the provisions of the Security Council resolutions on Cyprus, which state that such overflights increase political tension on the island and undermine efforts towards achieving a final settlement. On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, I wish to protest strongly against these new provocative acts by Turkey, a Member State of the United Nations, against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus. These acts are in complete disregard of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant decisions of the Organization on the question of Cyprus. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 61, and of the Security Council. (Signed) James DROUSHIOTIS Chargé d'affaires a.i.
