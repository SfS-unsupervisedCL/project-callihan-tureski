Sixty-seventh session Agenda item 158 (a) Financing of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the Middle East: United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Financing arrangements for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 Note by the Secretary-General 1. By its resolution 66/276 on the financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), the General Assembly appropriated for UNDOF the total amount of $47,990,600 for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, inclusive of $45,992,000 for the maintenance of the Force, $1,895,100 for the support account for peacekeeping operations and $103,500 for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy. The resources approved by the Assembly for UNDOF provided for the maintenance of 1,047 military contingent personnel and a civilian component of 46 international staff and 110 national staff. 2. During the 2012/13 period, the security situation in the Syrian Arab Republic has further deteriorated, to the extent that it has begun to have an impact on the operations of UNDOF. A number of incidents occurred in the area of separation and in the area of limitation on the Bravo side, which placed the safety and security of UNDOF personnel and assets at substantial risk. The evolving situation on the ground has significantly affected the ability of UNDOF to implement its mandate of maintaining the ceasefire and ensuring that it is observed, as prescribed in the Protocol to the Agreement on Disengagement between Israeli and Syrian Forces and in accordance with Security Council resolution 350 (1974). In response to these developments, UNDOF relocated its civilian personnel from Damascus to Camp Faouar in order to mitigate the security risks to its personnel and assets, resulting in the construction of additional office and residential accommodation in Camp Faouar and the upgrade and enhancement of existing security infrastructure in the compound. In addition, the ongoing security situation has resulted in a change in the classification of the duty station, which has in turn resulted in the implementation of additional related entitlements for international and national staff. 3. The additional requirements, which have resulted from the ongoing security situation in the mission area, are currently estimated at $8,593,100, of which $619,900 can be accommodated through the reprioritization of the utilization of approved resources for the 2012/13 period, resulting in additional requirements of $7,973,200 gross ($7,787,100 net) (see table).

Accordingly, the projected revised requirements for the maintenance of UNDOF would amount to $53,965,200 gross ($52,716,400 net) for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, representing an increase of $7,973,200 gross ($7,787,100 net) over the appropriation of $45,992,000 gross ($44,929,300 net) approved by the General Assembly for the maintenance of the Force in its resolution 66/276. 5. The additional resource requirements of $1,682,100 for international staff are attributable to the approval of danger pay effective 1 June 2012 and to the reclassification of the duty station by the International Civil Service Commission from "C" to "E" effective 1 January 2013. 6. The additional requirements of $1,475,000 for national staff are attributable to the approval of danger pay effective 1 June 2012 and to the special measures approved by the Office of Human Resources Management. The special measures for national staff included a 40 per cent non-pensionable bonus for the period from May to July 2012 and the denomination of national salary scales in United States dollars, effective 1 August 2012, based on the United Nations operational exchange rate of 49.30 Syrian pounds per United States dollar. 7. The additional requirements of $160,000 under general temporary assistance are attributable to the proposed establishment of two temporary positions, of Senior Adviser to the Force Commander at the P-5 level and of Security Information Analyst at the P-3 level, in the Office of the Force Commander as a result of the prevailing security situation in the mission area. These temporary positions would be required to strengthen the capacity of the Force to respond to the increased demand for reporting requirements to Headquarters in connection with the ongoing security situation and to augment the Force's capacity to undertake security and threat analysis and assessments. The proposed establishment of these positions is included in the budget for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (A/67/705, paras. 20 and 21). 8. The additional requirements of $12,600 for official travel are attributable to the deployment of seven additional staff from other offices on temporary duty assignments to provide urgent security and logistical support to UNDOF. 9. The additional requirements of $4,287,600 for facilities and infrastructure are attributable to: (a) the upgrading of existing security infrastructure; (b) the construction of additional office space and residential accommodation in Camp Faouar in connection with the relocation of 110 civilian staff from Damascus to the Camp compound; and (c) the redeployment of 30 military contingent personnel from the logistics battalion to reinforce the UNDOF headquarters reserve company. 10. The additional requirements of $9,800 under information technology are attributable to the acquisition of additional equipment related to the relocation of staff to Camp Faouar and Camp Ziouani, owing to the security situation. 11. The additional requirements of $460,000 for special equipment are attributable to the acquisition of binoculars and night-vision equipment to enhance the Force's observation capability in its area of operations in order to respond to changes in the security situation. 12. The additional requirements of $506,000 under other supplies, services and equipment are attributable to freight costs for the internal movement of equipment obtained from the strategic deployment stocks in the Global Service Centre and of surplus medical equipment transferred from the United Nations Mission in Timor-Leste. The estimate also includes requirements for 15 individual contractors on the Alpha and Bravo sides to function as drivers for heavy vehicles. In addition, as a result of the relocation of various support and camp services functions to the Alpha side, the estimate also includes requirements for 10 individual contractors to provide those services. 13. Taking into account the related opinion of the Advisory Committee on requests for revised appropriations (A/59/734, para. 8), the Secretariat considers the circumstances of this request as exceptional, owing to the fact that: (a) the additional requirements relate to cash resources for the payment of danger pay to international and national staff, for payments related to the reclassification of the duty station from "C" to "E", and for national staff salaries and related costs, which have been denominated in United States dollars effective 1 August 2012, for which no provisions were made in the 2012/13 budget; and (b) the approved budget for UNDOF does not have the capacity to absorb the additional requirements, which represent 17.3 per cent of its total budget for the 2012/13 period. 14. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the Force are: (a) To appropriate the amount of $7,973,200 for the maintenance of the Force for the 12-month period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, in addition to the amount of $45,992,000 already appropriated for the same period for the maintenance of the Force under the provisions of General Assembly resolution 66/276; (b) To assess the total amount in paragraph (a) above, in addition to the amount of $45,992,000 already assessed for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013.
