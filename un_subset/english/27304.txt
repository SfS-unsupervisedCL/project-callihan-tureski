United Nations Commission on International Trade Law UNCITRAL Digest of case law on the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods* Article 62 The seller may require the buyer to pay the price, take delivery or perform his other obligations, unless the seller has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with this requirement. The right to require specific performance 1. This provision entitles the seller to require the buyer to perform its obligations, a remedy generally recognised in civil law systems, whereas common law systems only allow for specific performance in limited circumstances. 2. This provision is designed to assist sellers who have a particular interest in the performance by the buyer, in particular the obligation to take delivery of the goods. However, illustrations of recourse to this remedy in case law, involving the hypothesis that a buyer refuses to take delivery, are rare. Illustrations of the application of article 62 to the payment of the purchase price, on the other hand, are numerous. Limitations of the right to require specific performance 3. The right to require performance does, however, have two kinds of limitations. One emerges clearly from the wording of the provision: the seller is deprived of this right if it has resorted to a remedy which is inconsistent with the seller insisting upon the specific performance, as in the case where it had declared the contract avoided (article 64) or fixed an additional period of time for performance (article 63). The second limitation is related to the application of article 28. Thus, the competent judge is not bound to order specific performance on behalf of the seller as required under article 62 if the judge would not do so under its domestic law in respect of similar contracts.
