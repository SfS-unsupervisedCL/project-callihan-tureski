Those measures include: an embargo on proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems, with exemptions; a ban on the export and procurement of any arms and related materiel from the Islamic Republic of Iran and on the supply of the seven categories of conventional weapons as defined for the purposes of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms and related services to the Islamic Republic of Iran; an assets freeze and a travel ban on designated individuals and/or entities, with exemptions, as specified; financial and business restrictions; and a ban on the provision of bunkering services, when there are reasonable grounds to believe that vessels are carrying prohibited items in the context of resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008) and 1929 (2010). 4. In carrying out its mandate, the Committee is assisted by the Panel of Experts, created pursuant to paragraph 29 of resolution 1929 (2010) to carry out, under the direction of the Committee, the tasks provided for in that paragraph. The Panel was initially established by the Security Council for a period of 12 months, until 9 June 2011. By its resolution 1984 (2011), the Council extended the mandate of the Panel of Experts until 9 June 2012. On 30 June 2011, the Secretary-General reappointed the eight experts serving the Panel at that time. During the reporting period, the Panel submitted its final report, dated 7 May, and two midterm reports dated 4 February and 9 November. It also submitted its programme of work to the Committee, as required in paragraph 3 of resolution 1984 (2011). The Panel also provided to the Committee four quarterly assessments of Member States' implementation reports in accordance with paragraph 31 of resolution 1929 (2010). During the reporting period, the Panel of Experts participated in a number of events, which are listed in annex I. III. Summary of the Committee's activities Revision of the guidelines of the Committee 5. The guidelines of the Committee for the conduct of its work were initially adopted on 30 May 2007. On 24 April 2008, the Committee approved a revised text of the guidelines, which incorporated the relevant provisions of resolution 1803 (2008). The guidelines went through another substantial revision in July 2011, during which the relevant provisions of resolutions 1929 (2010) and 1984 (2011) were taken into consideration. The Committee approved the guidelines on 19 August 2011. Copies of the guidelines were subsequently transmitted to all Member States and relevant international and regional organizations and agencies. The guidelines are available on the Committee's web page, at www.un.org/sc/committees/1737/pdf/ revisedguidelinesfinal.pdf. Informal consultations 6. In 2011, the Committee met four times in informal consultations (4 March, 8 June, 16 June and 7 December). The Committee also conducted its work using the silent procedure. 7. On 4 March, the Committee received an oral briefing from the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts in which she summarized the key points of the Panel's interim report of 4 February. The Committee agreed to consider, among other actions, disseminating additional optional guidance on submitting implementation reports, possibly by means of a note verbale and/or through the Committee's website, and to periodically organize open briefings at United Nations Headquarters for interested Member States. The Committee also agreed to request additional information from Member States about the individuals and entities on the Committee's consolidated list. 8. On 8 June, the Committee received a briefing from the Panel of Experts on its final report, which was submitted pursuant to paragraph 29 of resolution 1929 (2010). 9. At its meeting on 16 June, the Committee continued its discussion of the final report and agreed to continue to consider actions to implement the recommendations contained in the report that enjoy consensus. In that respect, the Committee decided to request the Panel of Experts to draft implementation assistance notices based on the five thematic areas covered by the recommendations. The Panel submitted the five drafts to the Committee on 5 July 2011. 10. At its meeting on 7 December, the Committee heard an oral briefing provided by the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts, who summarized the essential points contained in the Panel's midterm report of 9 November 2011, submitted to the Committee in accordance with paragraph 2 of resolution 1984 (2011). The Committee also agreed to hold an open briefing, subject to Committee agreement on the format and with the assistance of the Panel of Experts, to inform Member States of the mandate and activities of the Committee and its Panel of Experts. Implementation reports received from Member States 11. By the end of the reporting period, the Committee received a total of 96 reports under resolution 1737 (2006), 83 reports under resolution 1747 (2007), 77 reports under resolution 1803 (2008) and 77 reports under resolution 1929 (2010) (see annex II). Notifications and requests for exceptions received from Member States 12. The Committee received a number of notifications during the reporting period: three notifications under paragraph 5 of resolution 1737 (2006) concerning the delivery of items for use in the nuclear plant in Bushehr, the Islamic Republic of Iran; six notifications under paragraph 15 of resolution 1737 (2006) in connection with the receipt and/or unfreezing of funds in order to make payments due under contracts entered into prior to the listing of the respective entities; two notifications under paragraph 13 (b) of resolution 1737 (2006) regarding exemptions to the assets freeze for extraordinary expenses; and one notification under paragraph 13 (d) of resolution 1737 (2006), which provides for an exemption to the assets freeze for activities directly related to the items specified in paragraphs 3 (b) (i) and (ii) of the resolution. 90-day reports to the Security Council 13. Under the provisions of subparagraph 18 (h) of resolution 1737 (2006), the Chair must report to the Security Council at least every 90 days on the Committee's activities. Accordingly, the Chair briefed the Council on 22 March, 23 June, 7 September and 21 December 2011 (see S/PV.6502, S/PV.6563, S/PV.6607 and S/PV.6697). Responses to queries received from Member States 14. The Committee responded to four written queries from Member States requesting guidance and/or information on various aspects of the sanctions regime. The queries concerned the following issues: the scope of the assets freeze and the reasons for the designation of an entity as subject to the assets freeze (two queries); the presumed involvement of a Member State in an incident of illegal arms transshipment previously reported by another Member State (one query); and information on whether an Iranian entity indicated in the letter from a Member State was the same as an entity listed in annex III to resolution 1803 (2008) (one query). IV. Violations and alleged violations of the sanctions regime 15. During the period under review, the Committee received six notifications of reported "violations" of Security Council measures relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Three of those notifications reported a "violation" of paragraph 5 of resolution 1747 (2007) and included information indicating that the reporting Member State inspected and seized shipments of conventional weapons. Two of the notifications reported a "violation" of paragraph 3 of resolution 1737 (2006), as amended by paragraph 13 of resolution 1929 (2010), and included information that the reporting Member State inspected and seized shipments of dual-use items. The last notification reported a "violation" of paragraph 9 of resolution 1929 (2010) and included information indicating that the reporting Member States concluded that the Islamic Republic of Iran undertook both activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons and launches using ballistic missile technology. 16. In response, the Committee dispatched letters to most reporting States expressing its appreciation for the information provided and urging them to continue to cooperate closely with the Committee and the Panel of Experts in their investigation of the cases. The Committee also dispatched letters to States concerned with a previously reported violation that was recorded in the Committee's 2010 annual report (see S/2010/682, para. 19) and received responses from two Member States. 17. In accordance with its mandate, the Panel of Experts carried out inspections of five of the six reported cases with the consent and cooperation of the reporting States. As required by its mandate, the Panel of Experts provided its findings and recommendations with regard to the cases in separate reports to the Committee. 18. The Committee, with the assistance of the Panel of Experts, is continuing its investigations of the reported incidents. V. Observations and recommendations 19. The primary responsibility for the implementation of the measures imposed by the Security Council rests with Member States. The Committee notes with grave concern that the continued trend of reported sanctions violations involving prohibited arms transfers from the Islamic Republic of Iran, first highlighted publicly by the Committee in 2009, is continuing. Violations by Member States of their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations are a serious matter. For its part, in facilitating and monitoring the implementation of the relevant measures, the Committee will continue to discharge its mandate as effectively and efficiently as possible, and it stands ready to consider any proposals that fall within its purview. In this respect, the Committee welcomes the assistance of the Panel of Experts and urges all Member States to cooperate fully with the Committee and the Panel.
