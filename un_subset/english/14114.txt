Implementation of previous recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions VI. Organizational charts 1. The United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) was established by Security Council resolution 1312 (2000) of 31 July 2000 for an initial period of six months. The mandate of the Mission has been extended and adjusted by subsequent resolutions, the latest of which was resolution 1369 (2001) of 14 September 2001. 2. The Controller, in his letter dated 22 March 2001 to the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, informed the Advisory Committee that recent and prospective anticipated developments specific to certain peacekeeping missions (including UNMEE) would likely affect their mandates, operational concepts, scope and scale of activities and related resource requirements. It was envisaged that those developments would impact the development, preparation and timing of submissions of their budgets for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002. In the case of UNMEE, the revised estimates for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 were reviewed by the Advisory Committee in February 2001 and considered by the Fifth Committee during the second part of the resumed session of the General Assembly in May 2001. The Secretariat was not in a position to concomitantly prepare and submit a budget for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 for review by the Advisory Committee in March 2001 and consideration by the Fifth Committee in May 2001, as the Secretary-General in his report to the Security Council on UNMEE (S/2001/202), recommended that the Mission's mandate be adjusted to include support to the Boundary Commission. By its resolution 1344 (2001) of 15 March 2001, the Security Council, inter alia, decided to extend the mandate of the Mission until 15 September 2001 and subsequent resolution 1369 (2001) to extend the mandate of the Mission to 15 March 2002, and to consider the recommendations of the Secretary-General in paragraphs 50 and 53 of his report upon receipt of more detailed information. Depending on the timing of the submission of the additional information requested and subsequent action by the Security Council, the proposed 2001-2002 budget for UNMEE would have to take account of those requirements. Consequently, an initial proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 that would have been submitted earlier would have been overtaken by events and would have had to be prepared anew, recosted and resubmitted at a later date. 3. The Controller therefore requested that the Advisory Committee recommend to the General Assembly, as an interim measure, the granting of commitment authorization with assessment in the amount of $90 million gross ($88,933,450 net) for the maintenance of UNMEE for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2001, pending submission of the detailed UNMEE budget to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth regular session. 4. On the recommendation of the Advisory Committee (see A/55/874, para. 10 (b)), the General Assembly in its resolution 55/252 B of 14 June 2001, authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments in the amount of $90 million gross ($88,933,450 net) for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2001, and decided that those amounts should be assessed on Member States. By the same resolution, the Assembly appropriated and assessed the amount of $5,444,104 gross ($4,777,737 net) for the support account for peacekeeping operations and the amount of $568,706 gross ($510,695 net) for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi representing the prorated share of the Mission in the support account and Logistics Base requirements for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002. 5. The present report contains the proposed budget for the 12-month period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 for the maintenance of UNMEE, which amounts to $208,879,800 gross ($204,969,700 net). Additionally, non-budgeted voluntary contributions-in-kind amount to $200,000. 6. Estimated requirements for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 represent a 16 per cent increase ($28,879,800) in total resources (gross) in relation to the apportionment for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001. The proposed overall increase reflects a 79.7 per cent increase in military personnel costs, a 71.6 per cent increase in civilian personnel costs, a 78.6 per cent increase in other programmes and an 83.3 per cent increase in staff assessment. This is offset by a 39.9 per cent decrease in operational requirements. The financial resource requirements are summarized in table 1, and military and civilian staff requirements are provided in table 2.

The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are as follows: (a) Appropriation of the amount of $208,879,800 gross ($204,969,700 net), for the maintenance of the Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002, inclusive of the amount of $90 million gross ($88,933,450 net) previously authorized and assessed under the terms of General Assembly resolution 55/252 B of 14 June 2001 for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2001; (b) Assessment of the additional amount of $14,439,900 gross ($13,551,400 net) for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2001; (c) Assessment of the amount of $43,516,625 gross ($42,702,021 net) for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2002; (d) Assessment of the amount of $60,923,275 gross ($59,782,829 net) for the period from 16 March to 30 June 2002 at a monthly rate of $17,406,650 gross ($17,080,808 net) should the Security Council decide to continue the mandate of the Mission. II. Political mandate of the Mission Security Council resolutions 1320 (2000) of 15 September 2000 1344 (2001) of 15 March 2001 1369 (2001) of 14 September 2001 8. Information on the political mandate of UNMEE, as set out in paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 1320 (2000), is provided in paragraph 6 of the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of UNMEE dated 4 December 2000 (A/55/666 and Corr.1). 9. In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1344 (2001) of 15 March 2001, the Security Council called on parties to continue working towards the full and prompt implementation of the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities and the subsequent Peace Agreement signed by them in Algiers on 18 June 2000 (S/2000/601, annex) and 12 December 2000 (A/56/686-S/2001/1183, annex) respectively. This includes the expeditious completion of the remaining steps, in particular the rearrangement of forces necessary for the establishment of the temporary security zone, and to fulfil the obligations as follows: (a) ensure freedom of movement and access for UNMEE; (b) establish a direct air corridor between Addis Ababa and Asmara in the interest of the safety of United Nations personnel; (c) conclude on the status-of-forces agreements with the Secretary-General; and (d) facilitate mine action in coordination with the United Nations Mine Action Service, in particular through exchanging and providing existing maps and any other relevant information to the United Nations. 10. In paragraph 3 of resolution 1344 (2001), the Security Council stressed that the Agreements link the termination of the United Nations peacekeeping mission with the completion of the process of delimitation and demarcation of the Ethiopia-Eritrea border, which is a key element of the peace process. 11. In paragraph 5 of resolution 1344 (2001), the Security Council stressed the importance of the close relationship between UNMEE and the Boundary Commission and, noting the recommendations contained in paragraphs 50 and 53 of the report to the Secretary-General of 7 March 2001 (S/2001/202), encouraged UNMEE to provide appropriate support for the Boundary Commission. 12. In its resolution 1369 (2001) of 14 September 2001, the Security Council decided to extend the mandate of UNMEE until 15 March 2002 at the troop and military observer levels authorized by its resolution 1320 (2000), and called on the parties to urgently resolve the outstanding issues in accordance with the Algiers agreements and fulfil the following obligations: (a) the parties must provide freedom of movement and access for UNMEE personnel and its supplies as required for the performance of the Mission's duties; Eritrea must without restrictions allow UNMEE to monitor the 15 km area north of the temporary security zone and Ethiopia must avoid creating restrictions on the freedom of movement of UNMEE in the 15 km area south of the temporary security zone; (b) the parties must facilitate the establishment of a secure and practicable air corridor between Addis Ababa and Asmara which does not require a detour through other countries, by accepting the proposal made in that regard by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General; (c) Eritrea must provide UNMEE with information on the local militia and police inside the temporary security zone, including their weapons, necessary for the mission to verify that the functions and configurations of the militia and police do not exceed that which prevailed before the outbreak of the conflict; (d) Ethiopia must provide UNMEE with full information and maps concerning all minefields so as to facilitate the work of the Mine Action Coordination Centre with a view, inter alia, to allowing internally displaced persons to return safely to homes within the temporary security zone; (e) Eritrea must, without further delay, conclude the status-of-forces agreement with the Secretary-General; (f) the parties must, unconditionally and without further delay, and in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Conventions, release and return the remaining prisoners of war and detainees under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross; (g) the parties must fulfil their financial responsibilities regarding the Boundary Commission. 13. The current mandate of UNMEE expires on 15 March 2002 (see Security Council resolution 1369 (2001)). III. Operational plan and requirements 14. The operational plan and requirements of the Mission are derived from its concept of operations, as set out in paragraphs 16 to 44 of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council on Ethiopia and Eritrea (S/2000/785) as well as in his subsequent reports to the Security Council dated 18 September 2000 (S/2000/879), 12 January 2001 (S/2001/45), 7 March 2001 (S/2001/202), 19 June 2001 (S/2001/608) and 5 September 2001 (S/2001/843). 15. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council dated 12 January 2001 (S/2001/45), an agreement was signed on 12 December 2000 between the Government of the State of Eritrea and the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia envisaging, among others, the establishment of a neutral boundary commission which is mandated to delimit and demarcate the colonial treaty border on the basis of pertinent colonial treaties and applicable international law, and the establishment of a neutral commission to decide on all claims for loss, damage or injury from either side. Pursuant to the signing of the above agreement, trust funds to facilitate the financing of the two independent commissions have been established. 16. In resolution 1369 (2001), the Security Council, inter alia, extended the mandate of UNMEE until 15 March 2002 and expressed its intention to continue to monitor closely the progress by the parties in implementing the provisions of the Algiers agreements and the requirements of that resolution, and to consider a mission to the two countries before agreeing to a further mandate renewal in order to monitor progress and discuss possible further steps towards reconciliation. 17. In accordance with the reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council dated 19 June 2001 (S/2001/608) and 5 September 2001 (S/2001/843), UNMEE included, in its budget proposal for 2001-2002, resources to continue to provide for the core Mine Action Coordination Centre staff and equipment to enable it to effectively carry out its coordination role, technical advice and information management for mine action in the temporary security zone. The UNMEE budget for 2001-2002 proposes to outsource the 20 staff posts, including the 8 local staff that were previously considered as civilian posts in the authorized UNMEE staffing table, and to include them under contractual staff. 18. As reported by the Secretary-General (S/2001/202, S/2001/608, S/2001/843), and in line with the recommendations contained in the report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations (A/55/305-S/2000/809), the amount of $700,000 was included in the 2000-2001 budget of UNMEE for quick-impact projects. However, as the establishment of the temporary security zone was delayed until April 2001, only five projects at a cost of $32,203 were able to be implemented during the period. As a consequence, an amount of $585,900 has been requested under quick-impact projects, representing reprogramming of 2000-2001 delayed projects. 19. In response to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/55/688/Add.1), UNMEE has reviewed the operations of the Political Affairs Office in the light of the experiences gained. According to the newly proposed structure, UNMEE will have a central Political Affairs Office in Asmara comprising seven Professional and two General Service international staff members, and an office in Addis Ababa comprising four international staff members, with a network of five field centres in Assab, Barentu, Senafe, Adigrat and Mekele. Under this proposed structure, the Political Affairs Office falls under the direct operational responsibility of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and is headed by the Principal Political Affairs Officer, who is also his Principal Political Adviser. 20. UNMEE also proposed, in the budget for 2001-2002, to establish a Geographic Cell within the Buildings Management and Engineering Section comprising three international staff members and three United Nations Volunteers (UNV) to conduct terrain studies and to collect, evaluate and disseminate geographic information to UNMEE, the field offices of United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations and the host countries. 21. In response to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to explore ways of increasing participation of UNV (A/55/688/Add.1), UNMEE took steps to convert both local and international into UNV positions. In the administrative component, UNMEE proposed the conversion of 40 local posts into 24 UNV positions and of 17 international professional posts into 17 UNV positions. 22. Under these circumstances, the proposed 2001-2002 budget for UNMEE is based on the Mission's requirements for maintenance, that is: (a) the deployment of a military component at the strength authorized in Security Council resolution 1320 (2000) of up to 4,200 troops, including up to 220 military observers; (b) substantive offices comprising 71 international staff members, 24 local staff members and 10 United Nations Volunteers; and (c) an administrative component headed by the Chief Administrative Officer and comprising 186 international and 250 local staff as well as 72 United Nations Volunteers. IV. Contributions made under the status-of-forces agreement 23. The status-of-forces agreement between the United Nations and the Government of Ethiopia was concluded on 23 March 2001. Under its terms, the Government has provided the United Nations with the following facilities: Value (United States dollars) Government Contribution 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 Ethiopia Premises for accommodation of military personnel, office premises, transit camps or other premises for the conduct of operational and administrative activities of UNMEE a Provision of water, electricity and other facilities free of charge. a Not quantified. 24. Pending the conclusion and signature of the status-of-forces agreement with the Government of Eritrea in respect of UNMEE, the model status-of-forces agreement of 9 October 1990 (A/45/594, annex) applies provisionally. A. Voluntary contributions Value (United States dollars) Government/organization Contributions in kind Netherlands Bailey Bridge B. Trust fundsa United States dollars Trust Fund in Support of the Delimitation and Demarcation of the Ethiopia/Eritrea Border Opening balance as at 30 June 2000 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 Income Expenditures Closing balance as at 30 June 2001 a The Trust Fund to Support the Peace Process in Ethiopia and Eritrea was established on 23 July 2001. VI. Status of reimbursement of troop-contributing Governments A. Current troop contributors 25. Formed military contingents have been provided to UNMEE by the Governments of Bangladesh, Canada, Denmark, France, India, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, the Netherlands and Slovakia. Staff officers for the force headquarters have been provided by the Governments of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Benin, Bulgaria, Finland, Gambia, Ghana, Ireland, Malaysia, Namibia, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania, Tunisia, United States of America and Zambia. B. Status of reimbursement 26. Full reimbursement in accordance with standard rates established by the General Assembly for troop costs have been made to troop-contributing States through 31 March 2001. It is estimated that an amount of $24,753,746 is due for troop costs for the period from 1 April to 30 September 2001. The standard rates of reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for troop costs for the 2001-2002 financial period reflects the amended rates approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/274 of 14 June 2001, representing two consecutive 2 per cent rate increases effective 1 July 2001 and 1 January 2002, respectively. VII. Contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment A. Method of reimbursement 27. Requirements for reimbursement of troop-contributing countries are based on the new standard reimbursement rates for contingent-owned equipment (wet-lease) and self-sustainment as approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/274 of 14 June 2001 based on the recommendation of the post-Phase V Working Group on reform procedures for determining reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment. B. Requirements 28. Requirements for the budgeted period for the reimbursement of troop-contributing countries for contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment costs are based on standard rates for contingent-owned equipment (wet-lease) and self-sustainment in respect of 3,110 infantry personnel and 870 personnel of logistical and specialized units. 1. Major equipment 29. Requirements for reimbursement of major equipment for the 2001/02 financial period are estimated at $17,757,500 exclusive of special equipment (see below). 2. Special equipment 30. Requirements for special equipment (demining and heavy engineering equipment) in respect of three troop contributors are estimated at $2,943,600. 3. Self-sustainment 31. Requirements for self-sustainment are estimated at $16,832,600, as follows: Catering Communications Office equipment Electrical Minor engineering Explosive ordnance disposal Laundry and cleaning Tentage Accommodation Medical Observation Identification Nuclear, biological, and chemical protection Field defence stores Miscellaneous general stores Unique equipment 4. Mission factors 32. Mission factors intended to compensate troop-contributing countries for extreme operational conditions in the Mission area apply to the monthly reimbursable rates, as indicated in the table below: Mission factor Extreme environmental conditions Intensified operational conditions Hostile action/forced abandonment Incremental transportation A. Changes in staffing requirements Number of posts Current staffing Proposed staffing requirements Net change Under-Secretary-General Assistant Secretary-General D-2 D-1 P-5 P-4 P-3 P-2/P-1 Subtotal General Service (Principal level) General Service (Other level) Field Service Security Service Total, international staff National officers 33. The proposed changes to the staffing requirements shown in the table above reflect the net reduced staffing of UNMEE and takes into account the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/55/688/Add.1) to review the operations of the various political offices referred to in the report of the Secretary-General (A/55/666 and Corr.1) and reflects the revised structure in the cost estimates. The proposed staffing requirements also reflect the recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee (A/55/688/Add.1) to explore opportunities to make greater use of United Nations Volunteers, and General Assembly resolution 55/120 of 6 December 2000, in which the Assembly has encouraged, whenever appropriate, the use of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) by the United Nations, including in peacekeeping operations, to ensure the unity and continuity of implementation required for integrated mine action programmes. 34. As indicated in the above table, the proposed staffing establishment of UNMEE is 613 posts, comprising 257 international staff members (109 Professional, 37 General Service and 111 Field Service), 82 United Nations Volunteers and 274 local staff members. Compared with the staffing establishment for the 2000-2001 financial period, the proposed staffing establishment reflects a net reduction of six personnel: reduction of 25 international (10 Professional, five General Service and 10 Field Service) and 48 local level staff, and an increase of 67 United Nations Volunteers. The proposed distribution of civilian staff by category and office is shown in section D below, with the deployment schedule of civilian personnel provided in section E. The proposed changes are summarized below. B. Substantive civilian component Organizational adjustments 35. The proposed staffing reflects the consolidation of the Political Affairs Office and the Office of the Political Affairs Advisor into a single Political Affairs Office, headed by the Political Affairs Advisor (D-1). The initially proposed Regional Political Affairs Office with two offices at Asmara and Addis Ababa would be transformed into five field centres at Assab, Barentu, Senafe in Eritrea and Adigrat and Mekele in Ethiopia. The five centres would constitute part of the Political Affairs Office and would cover three operational sectors (west, east and central) to ensure the maximum cooperation with the work of military observers in the temporary security zone and the adjacent areas. 36. The proposed changes in the staffing requirements and the composition of the Mission's substantive component also reflect the discontinuation of the Military Coordination Commission Secretariat located in Addis Ababa as well as the Mine Action Coordination Centre in view of the designation of UNOPS as principal service provider for integrated mine action programmes in the field. 37. The changes in the substantive component result in a net reduction of 20 posts comprising 30 abolitions and 10 new functions and posts: (a) Proposed staffing reductions: it is proposed to abolish a total of 30 substantive posts, comprising: (i) Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General: one D-1 in the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (redeployed to the Office of the Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General), three P-3 posts (two redeployed to the Offices of the Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General), one P-5, three P-4, seven P-3, one General Service (other level) posts and eight local-level posts from the Mine Action Coordination Centre; (ii) Office of the Deputy Special Representatives of the Secretary-General: nine local staff (three staff from the Office of the Deputy Special Representative in Asmara, four from the Regional Political Affairs Office and two from the Military Coordination Commission Secretariat), owing to the sensitive nature of the information disseminated from those offices; (iii) Office of the Force Commander: two local-level posts owing to the sensitive nature of the information disseminated from that office; (b) Proposed staffing increases: it is proposed to increase a total of 15 substantive posts, comprising: one D-1 post in the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (redeployed from the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (para. 37 (a) (i) refers)), two P-4 posts (one in Field Centre -- Adigrat and one in Field Centre -- Mekele), two P-3 posts in Field Centres in Barentu and Senafe (redeployed from the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (para. 37 (a) refers)), and 10 United Nations Volunteers positions in the Offices of Public Information and Human Rights. More detailed information on the role of the Office of Public Information and Office of Human Rights is provided in paragraphs 38 and 39 below; (c) New functions. 38. With the establishment of the temporary security zone, the Public Information Office is required to cover events and human-interest stories emanating from the zone. Owing to the lack of understanding about the mandate of UNMEE among the local population in Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Public Information Office needs to increase its output in terms of radio broadcasts and the periodicity of its newsletter and provide more information materials geared towards the local population, including audio cassettes on mine awareness, leaflets, stickers and videos. UNMEE has to be more proactive in this context. Many confidence-building measures, as called for in the Security Council resolution establishing UNMEE (1312 (2000) of 31 July 2000) could take the form of information activities and would require an extraordinary amount of effort and human and material resources. It is suggested that UNVs contribute to such efforts with both ideas and expertise. Based on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in its report dated 6 April 2001 (A/55/874) on making greater use of UNVs in substantive areas such as public information, it is therefore proposed that the Public Information Office be strengthened with four United Nations Volunteers, one Associate Administrative Assistant (Asmara), one Associate Information Officer (Addis Ababa), one Media Assistant (Asmara) and a Radio Assistant (Addis Ababa). The Associate Administrative Assistant will be responsible for assisting the Spokesman and Chief Public Information Officer in all matters pertaining to office management, administration and finance; contribute to the daily liaison and coordination between the public information offices in Asmara and Addis Ababa; interact with the Mission's relevant units for travel arrangements and other organizational requirements. The Associate Information Officer will be responsible for assisting with media analysis and monitoring; handling media relations and travelling with visiting media crews when necessary. The Media Assistant will be responsible for assisting with all aspects of visual media production, management and distribution, transcribing interviews and distributing public information office material to the field. With regard to the Radio Assistant, the incumbent will be responsible for assisting in creating ideas and formats for the production of radio news and feature programmes; assist in the translation of programmes into local languages; and assist with the distribution of programmes. 39. The Human Rights Office is primarily responsible for advising the Special Representative on the protection and promotion of human rights and to provide assistance to the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea in their efforts to ensure the implementation of the Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities. In its report dated 6 April 2001 (A/55/874), the Advisory Committee encouraged greater use of United Nations Volunteers in the area of human rights. It is therefore proposed that the Human Rights Office be strengthened with six additional UNVs (human rights officers). Under the supervision of the Chief Human Rights Officer, the human rights officers will be responsible for gathering information on the human rights situation, through close cooperation with other United Nations agencies and the local human rights community. The incumbents will also keep the Chief Human Rights Officer regularly informed on developments concerning the human rights situation and follow-up discussions with the relevant authorities. They will also participate in the establishment of contacts with local authorities as well as international organizations operating in the country and facilitate the implementation of the human rights mandate in the designated area of responsibility aimed at the establishment of an environment of mutual understanding between the two countries Ethiopia and Eritrea. C. Administrative civilian component 40. The administrative component reflects the establishment of the field sector offices comprising Sector West, Sector East and Sector Central, two logistics bases at Dekemhare and Assab, as well as the Geographic Cell within the Buildings Management and Engineering Section. 41. It is proposed to strengthen the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer through the redeployment of the post of Senior Administrative Officer from the Office of the Chief, Administrative Services, to the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer. For operational purposes, it is also proposed to separate the movement control function from the Joint Logistics Operations Control Section, and to establish a new Movement Control Section from within the staffing of the Joint Logistics Operations Control Section. For operational expediency, the Medical Services Section, formerly within the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer would now be under the Office of the Chief, Administrative Services. 42. The administrative component also reflects the establishment of a Geographic Cell within the Buildings Management and Engineering Section, comprising three international staff and three United Nations Volunteers in addition to the creation of local language assistants. The Geographic Cell in UNMEE would be part of the pilot project to implement geographical information systems (GIS) in peacekeeping operations, with a view to enhancing operational readiness and capacity. The Cell would help to meet the requirements of UNMEE, of the field offices of United Nations agencies, of the GIS Section within the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and of the host countries for geographic analysis. It would collect, evaluate and disseminate geographic information, forecasting the effects of weather and terrain on operations. In addition, the cell would provide GIS training and education programmes for users of this information, especially within UNMEE. Job descriptions for related GIS functions are provided in annex III to the present report. 43. The changes in the administrative component result in a net increase of 14 posts comprising 44 abolitions and 58 new functions: (a) Staffing reductions: it is proposed to abolish 44 administrative posts comprising: one P-4 post (Medical Services Section), four General Service (other level) posts (one from the Logistics Base -- Barentu, one from the Logistics Base -- Assab, one from the Medical Services Section, one from the Supply Section), 10 Field Service and 29 local-level staff; (b) Staffing increases: it is proposed to establish a total of 58 administrative posts, comprising one P-3 post in the Geographic Cell and 57 United Nations Volunteers positions in the following sections: Administrative Liaison Office (Addis Ababa) (two), General Services Section (two), Sector West (nine), Sector Central (four), Logistics Base -- Dekemhare (one), Sector East (four), Logistics Base -- Assab (three), Geographic Section (three), Electronic Services Section (ten), Buildings Management and Engineering Section (five), Transport Section (eight) and the Medical Services Section (six). 1. The proposed budget for the 2001/2002 fiscal period is based on the strength of 4,200 military personnel, including up to 220 military observers, 257 international staff, 274 local staff and 82 United Nations Volunteers. The budget reflects increased requirements for reimbursement to troop-contributing Governments of contingent-owned equipment on wet-lease arrangement and self-sustainment provided to UNMEE and civilian personnel as well as for air operations support, supplies and services, mine-clearing and training programmes. These increased requirements are offset by reduced requirements under transportation, communications, air and surface freight, electronic data-processing and other equipment. Apportionment: $64,188,500; estimate: $115,361,800; variance: $51,173,300 2. The estimated requirements of $115,361,800 under this heading is based on the phased deployment of the Mission's authorized military component of 3,980 personnel, excluding 220 military observers, during the 2001-2002 financial period. The cost is comprised of requirements for military observers ($8,272,000), military contingents ($67,876,100) and other requirements pertaining to military personnel ($39,213,700). 3. The requirements under this heading are based on the phased deployment of 220 military observers to UNMEE as indicated in table 1 below, and are based on the mission-specific rates contained in annex II.A. The estimates provide for mission subsistence allowance for 79,910 person-days ($6,424,000), emplacement travel ($1,804,000) and clothing and equipment allowance ($44,000). Deployment of military observers Actual Planned July Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun 4. Provision of $67,876,100 with respect to military contingents is related to the phased deployment of the authorized strength of 3,980 contingent personnel in accordance with table 2 below, and consists of three infantry battalions and the necessary specialized support personnel, including a company of construction engineers and three demining units, a military police unit, an aviation unit, one guard and administrative units, a level II medical facility and a force reserve company. The estimates provide for standard troop cost reimbursement for 46,546 person-months ($46,355,800) as well as rations, including bottled water and a 16-day reserve, at unit costs provided in annex II.A. ($7,762,000). An amount of $546,000 is provided for the meal portion of mission subsistence allowance up to 15 October 2001 in respect of 126 force headquarters staff officers in lieu of the mission-provided catering services. This provision has been discontinued effective 15 October 2001. An amount of $7,850,000 is provided for the deployment and rotation of military contingents and is based on two rotations, with one contingent rotating once during the 2001-2002 period and the other contingent for a six-month period only with a replacement unit expected subsequently. Table 2 Deployment of contingent personnel Other requirements pertaining to military personnel 5. The provision of $39,213,700 under this heading covers the reimbursement of troop contributors for major equipment based on wet-lease arrangements ($20,701,100) and self-sustainment ($16,832,600), and are calculated using the new standard wet-lease reimbursement rates approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/274 of 14 June 2001 on the basis of the recommendations of the post-Phase V Working Group on reform procedures for determining reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment. The estimated requirements are based on memoranda of understanding concluded with troop contributors or under negotiation with current and prospective troop contributors. 6. Further provision made for reimbursement to Governments of payments made by them to their military personnel for death, disability, injury or illness resulting from service with UNMEE amounts to $1,680,000 and is based on an average payment of $40,000 calculated at 1 per cent of the average monthly strength of military personnel. Apportionment: $16,689,500; estimate: $28,646,000; variance: $11,956,500 7. The estimated requirements of $28,646,000 under this heading provide for the deployment of 613 civilian staff, including 257 international (109 Professional, 37 General Service and 111 Field Service), 274 local and 82 United Nations Volunteers. International and local staff 8. The cost estimates for international staff are based on New York standard salary costs for 30 per cent of international posts and salary scales for appointments of limited duration for 70 per cent of the posts. The provision under common staff costs for mission appointees takes into account lower requirements for this category of staff and reflects a reduction of 50 per cent compared with the standard costs. Salaries and common staff costs for local staff are based on the local salary scales applicable to the mission area (see annex II.A). Provision for salaries, common staff costs and mission subsistence allowance for international and local staff also take into account a 10 per cent vacancy rate. In addition, the estimates provide for hazardous duty station allowance. 9. A provision of $4,600 is made for overtime (corresponding to 0.5 per cent of local staff salaries), based on the Mission's actual needs. 10. With respect to other official travel, as detailed in annex II.A, reduced requirements of $229,700 cover travel for political consultations and meetings ($106,800), travel of United Nations Headquarters personnel in connection with administrative and technical support for the Mission ($46,600), local travel of UNMEE staff to attend meetings ($30,000), travel of geographic information systems officers to attend meetings ($8,300) and travel of the internal audit team ($38,000). 11. Provision of $2,245,100 under this heading reflects the deployment of 82 United Nations Volunteers for the period under review in the Offices of Public Information, Human Rights, General Services, Field/Sector Offices, Administrative liaison office, Movement Control, Transport, Buildings Management and Engineering, Electronic Support Services, Medical Unit, Logistic Bases and Air Operations and would cover a total of 702 person-months. Apportionment: $94,707,100; estimate: $56,886,400; variance: $37,820,700 12. The reduced requirements amounting to $37,820,700 with respect to operational requirements is attributable to the minimal provision for non-recurrent requirements owing to the fact that substantial purchases of a non-recurrent nature were provided for in the budgetary provision for the previous financial period. Annex II.C provides a detailed breakdown of the non-recurrent requirements for the 2001-2002 budget period. Premises/accommodation 13. Provision of $8,203,500 under this heading reflects the lower requirements for the replacement and acquisition of pre-fabricated accommodations and ablution units during the budget period. The provision includes rental of premises for the Mission and Force headquarters at Asmara and Addis Ababa, Sector headquarters, staff officers' accommodation and other premises as detailed in annex II.A ($1,535,900), alteration and renovation of premises ($230,400), maintenance supplies ($153,600) and services ($153,600) and utilities ($1,595,700). Annex II.C includes $4,534,300 in non-recurrent requirements for the construction of pre-fabricated buildings which are required to set up full accommodation for 126 staff officers and to accommodate the level II hospital. Infrastructure repairs 14. The estimated requirements of $225,000 under this heading provide for the repair and maintenance of airstrips and helipads ($30,000), repair and maintenance of roads mission-wide ($100,000) and repair of bridges ($95,000). Transport operations 15. Requirements under this heading amounting to $5,090,000 provide for the rental of 12 pieces of heavy engineering equipment at an average cost of $1,000 per month ($12,000), provision for petrol, oil and lubricants ($3,337,700), which includes a 10 per cent reduction to account for off-road vehicles, as well as third-party insurance for the fleet of 377 United Nations-owned and 976 contingent-owned vehicles, 100 contingent-owned trailers and 270 contingent-owned containers ($218,600). 16. Provision has also been made for spare parts, repairs and maintenance of United Nations-owned vehicles ($1,521,700). Air operations 17. The provision of $26,178,600 covers a fleet of 12 helicopters and 7 fixed-wing aircraft under long-term commercial and letter-of-assist arrangements as follows: (a) Estimates under helicopter operations were based on the hiring of 12 helicopters for the 12-month period, seven medium-utility (MI-8 MTV-1), two military light observation/patrol helicopter (Hughes 500) (for the period from 1-18 July 2001), two Bell 212 helicopters (as a replacement for the two Hughes 500) as well as one medium utility (AS 330 Puma) helicopter on call for casualties and medical evacuations. The additional MI-8 MTV long range is required for long-range flying capacity; (b) Estimates for fixed-wing aircraft include one heavy cargo (IL-76, on loan from the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) if and when required), one medium passenger/cargo (AN-26), one military medium transport (G-222), one light jet aircraft (HS 125-400B), two military light observation/patrol (P-166) aircraft (one withdrawn on 25 August 2001) and one light aircraft for casualty and medical evacuations (C-160). 18. Detailed information on estimated fuel consumption, third-party liability insurance and other related costs are provided in annex II.A. 19. Provision under this heading totals $26,178,600 and covers helicopters ($17,616,900) and fixed-wing aircraft ($7,586,800), aircrew subsistence allowance ($258,800) and other air operations requirements ($716,100). 20. Provision of $3,357,500 under this heading reflects the acquisition of satellite equipment, including freight charges ($5,500), and workshop and test equipment ($13,800) as detailed in annex II.C, and commercial communications with respect to transponder user charges, INMARSAT (M and M4 terminals and vehicle tracking), telephone, charges for New York extensions, pouch, land line charges and independent Internet service ($1,887,100). Provision is also made for replacement communication parts and supplies based on 10 per cent of total equipment cost in addition to freight charges ($1,451,100). Substantial purchases of a non-recurrent nature were provided for in the initial budgetary provision. Other equipment 21. Requirements under the other equipment category of $2,306,700 are substantially lower than that of the 2000/01 financial period ($10,279,100), and provide for the minor acquisition and replacement of office furniture, electronic data-processing equipment, generators, water and septic tanks, accommodation equipment, miscellaneous equipment, water distribution and purification equipment and security equipment as detailed in annex II.C. Supplies and services 22. Estimated requirements amounting to $8,295,100 under the supplies and services budget line are primarily due to additional requirements under the contractual services provided for, inter alia, janitorial services, GIS contractual services, catering, laundry, photocopier lease contract and operation of water purification plants ($4,828,900). Provision under this heading is also made for security services, medical treatment and supplies and miscellaneous other services. 23. The estimate also includes acquisition of stationery and office supplies, medical supplies, sanitation and cleaning supplies, subscriptions, electrical supplies, uniforms, flags and decals, field defence stores, operational maps and quartermaster and general stores ($1,850,000). Annex II.A provides a detailed breakdown of supplies and services. Air and surface freight 24. An amount of $3,230,000 under this heading provides for commercial freight, cartage and clearing charges, as well as the transportation of purified water from purification plants to company locations in the three sectors ($1,800,000) and the transportation of United Nations-owned equipment from the United Nations Logistics Base to the Mission ($1,430,000). Apportionment: $2,281,800; estimate: $4,075,500; variance: $1,793,700 Public information programmes 25. Provision of $337,600 under this heading is made for the cost of replacing lost and/or damaged equipment ($17,600), the cost of materials and supplies required to support the public information programmes of the Mission ($40,000) and the cost of contractual services for the production and dissemination of brochures, posters and other educational material in support of the Mission's public information campaign ($280,000). Training programmes 26. The estimated requirements of $399,300 cover the cost of travel and administrative fees for the training of two finance, 10 electronic data-processing, 2 procurement, 2 transport and 15 communications personnel from UNMEE at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi; 2 movement control personnel from UNMEE for International Air Transport Association Dangerous Goods certification in South Africa and Geneva; 5 air operations specialists for the International Civil Aviation Organization seminar in Egypt, 3 supply personnel, 5 United Nations-owned equipment technical team and GIS personnel. Details are provided in annex II.A. Mine-clearing programmes 27. Requirements of $2,752,700 under this heading include the cost of the services of contractors ($1,186,800) in lieu of the 20 civilian staff posts (one P-5, three P-4, seven P-3, one General Service and eight local level) which are proposed to be converted into non-post resources for the budget cycle commencing 1 July 2001 for the Mine Action Coordination Centre. In addition, projected requirements cover miscellaneous supplies ($152,000), miscellaneous services ($1,290,000) and equipment ($123,900) as detailed in annex II.A. Quick-impact projects 28. Quick-impact projects of UNMEE cover the temporary security zone, its adjacent areas and some other conflict-affected areas in both Eritrea and Ethiopia. These projects have allowed UNMEE to assist a number of war-affected groups in both countries, and have helped to establish a closer relationship between UNMEE units at the field level, local administrations and communities. 29. Requirements amounting to $585,900 provide for the completion of projects including the replacement and repair of infrastructure, municipalities and utilities as well as the provision for necessary supplies. At the time of preparation of the cost estimates for the 2001/02 financial period, 50 quick-impact projects remain incomplete: 33 in Eritrea and 17 in Ethiopia. 30. Projects include (a) water and sanitation to provide potable water for residents and to re-establish the water supply through the rehabilitation of the existing water system; (b) education to complete construction on toilets at the schools and improve sanitation and also to improve and increase school capacity by providing additional classrooms, and also to provide equipment for HIV/AIDS public education programmes; (c) sports equipment and facilities for youth; (d) health to provide clinical services for the general population and equip the health centre in war-affected areas; (e) health and non-medical supplies to provide support for equipping the heath centre in war-affected areas; (f) electricity to provide the local population with electricity; and (g) miscellaneous supplies to supply school furniture. Apportionment: $2,133,100; estimate: $3,910,100\; variance: $1,777,000 31. The amount budgeted under this heading represents the difference between gross and net emoluments; that is, the amount of staff assessment to which United Nations staff members are subject, in accordance with the Staff Regulations of the United Nations. Staff assessment costs are based on the staffing complement of 257 international and 274 local staff members, as indicated in chapter VIII, section A, of the present report. Income from staff assessment Apportionment: ($2,133,100); estimate: ($3,910,100); variance: ( $1,777,000) 32. The staff assessment requirements provided for above have been credited to this item as income from staff assessment and will be credited to the Tax Equalization Fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 973 A (X) of 15 December 1955. Member States are given credit in the fund in proportion to their respective rates of contribution to the UNMEE budget. Annex III Geographic Cell job descriptions Chief of Geographic Cell (P-3). Acting under the supervision of the Chief, Integrated Support Service, the incumbent would be responsible for the overall planning, scheduling and monitoring of the GIS-related matters in peacekeeping operations; undertake the functions and roles described in the mandate of the Section and manage and supervise the staff in the Section. Topographic/GIS Engineers (Field Service). Under the supervision of the Chief of Section, the incumbent would be responsible for the overall planning and implementing of the GIS-related matters in peacekeeping operations; provide geographic/terrain analysis using modern GIS technology; produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather, terrain and operational situations in peacekeeping operations; compile textual, graphic products from text, electronic format of geographic data (vector, raster, satellite imageries) and other source of data; archive GIS data and maintain the database; provide geographic analysis data for staff in the mission; maintain the system technically and operationally.

The Committee welcomes the intention to review, in the light of experience, the operations of the various political offices referred to in the report of the Secretary-General, and requests that, if possible, the new structure be reflected in the 2001-2002 estimates (A/55/688Add.1, para. 10). A review of the operational structure of the Political Affairs Office took place at the end of April 2001 to ensure the streamlining of its coordination mechanisms and to ensure that there is a greater degree of clarity in the Office with regard to decision-making, communication and reporting. The unified Political Affairs Office falls underr the direct operational responsibility of the Special Representative and is headed by the Principal Political Affairs Officer, who acts concurrently as the Principal Political Adviser. Officers are located at the Headquarters offices in Asmara and Addis Ababa and in four field centres in and adjacent to the temporary security zone, as well as in Mekele, the capital of the regional Ethiopian state of Tigray. The Political Affairs Office has adopted this pattern of deployment in order to establish structures throughout the UNMEE area of operation that are capable of monitoring, analysing, assessing and evaluating political and other significant developments, as well as providing a forecast of events which may evolve from such developments, to ensure the successful implementation of the mandate. Officers are rotated every four to six months in order more effectively to harness their skills and talents for the implementation of the mandate, as well as to afford them an opportunity to diversify their mission experience. More officers are needed in the temporary security zone in order to raise the staff strength at each field centre from one to two. The political affairs officers in the four field centres in and adjacent to the temporary security zone, as well as in Mekele, submit their reports to the Office in Asmara, where a daily political affairs report is compiled for use by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and his Principal Affairs Officer. The Offices in Addis Ababa and in Asmara report to the Principal Political Affairs Officer. With specific regard to the issue of streamlining, operational emphasis has been placed on the field, thus leaving Addis Ababa with two political affairs officers and Asmara with four. This does not include the Principal Officer and two senior political affairs officers who have, respectively, overall oversight and managerial responsibilities; a P-5 officer attached to the Deputy Special Representative in Asmara; and a P-3 officer attached to the Force Commander to assist with the Military Coordination Commission's responsibilities. As far as budgetary implications are concerned, (a) reinforcing the field centres will attract additional costs in hazard allowances; and (b) planned quarterly meetings of all political affairs officers will also carry commensurate additional costs. 2. The Committee notes the information contained in the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council dated 12 January 2001 (S/2001/45, paras. 4-6 and 37 and 38) on the establishment and financing of the Boundary Commission. The Secretary-General described the role that UNMEE and the United Nations will play in the Commission and noted that they might revert to the Security Council and other competent United Nations bodies concerning the financing of the Commission. The Committee trusts, should funding be required from the United Nations assessed resources, proper United Nations procedures will be followed in the formulation and presentation of such a request to the General Assembly (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 11). The immediate requirements of the Boundary Commission are being funded from the Trust Fund to Support the Delimitation and Demarcation of the Ethiopia/Eritrea border. Where funding may ultimately be required from the UNMEE assessed budget, the Secretary-General will present such financing proposals to the General Assembly through the Advisory Committee. 3. The Committee concludes that the Centre would provide a useful forum for UNMEE staff, and military and humanitarian actors in the area to exchange information and learn about the role each is performing in the temporary security zone and the areas adjacent to it. The Committee believes that the Centre could also enhance and strengthen collaboration among all participants in the Mission concerning matters of staff security and welfare (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 18). Right from the beginning of UNMEE, a fully functioning civil military coordination unit was integrated into the operation at the headquarters level, with sector-level units in each of the three sectors of the temporary security zone and adjacent areas. At both the Asmara and Addis Ababa levels, there are a number of coordinating mechanisms, both within UNMEE, between UNMEE and the United Nations country teams and between UNMEE and the humanitarian community. With the Force Commander, the Principal Political Affairs Officer and the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator being members of UNMEE senior management, the information flow between involved parties on issues affecting civil military coordination operations has been streamlined at a senior level. As internally displaced persons begin to move back into the temporary security zone it will be more important than ever for sector-level civil military coordination units to hold regular coordination meetings with all the humanitarian players in the sector. 4. In connection with the mine action programme, and in view of the importance of the programme to the success of the Mission and to the humanitarian operation in the Mission area, the Committee trusts that adequate funding for the mine action programme will be realized in a timely manner (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 20). The UNMEE Mine Action Coordination Centre is responsible for coordination and technical management of all humanitarian mine action activities in the temporary security zone and adjacent areas. Funding from UNMEE assessed contributions does not cover all the Centre's activities, operating costs or equipment requirements. Additional activities are provided through the United Nations Mine Action Service Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action and are executed by the United Nations Office for Project Services on behalf of the United Nations Mine Action Service. Additional funding is required from the UNMEE budget in 2001-2002 to cover the costs of an UNMEE/Mine Action Coordination Centre road-proving project. A recent increase in anti-tank mine strikes on UNMEE, international non-governmental organization and local vehicles travelling over previously proven roads suggests that anti-tank mines are buried deeper than the proving capability of the equipment currently used in the mission area. Voluntary funds have continuously been raised through the Voluntary Trust Fund for the mine action work of the non-governmental Eritrean Demining Agency (EDA) and international non-governmental organizations operating in the mission area. However, additional efforts will be necessary to cover the ongoing costs of mine action non-governmental organizations in 2001-2002. 5. The Committee was informed that each service in the Mission carried out verification tasks and notes that the Secretariat, pursuant to recommendations of the Board of Auditors, has streamlined arrangements for handling verification reports at Headquarters. In this connection, the Advisory Committee stresses the importance of ensuring that qualified personnel are available in the field to implement all the requirements of the contingent-owned equipment reimbursement procedures (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 28). UNMEE welcomes the Secretariat's initiative in streamlining the handling of verification reports at Headquarters as recommended by the Board of Auditors. UNMEE also wishes to assure the Advisory Committee that UNMEE is vigilant in its effort to ensure that all the requirements for the implementation of proper verification reports are in place. The Mission is confident in the qualification of its memorandum of understanding management personnel, and is in the process of implementing the latest memorandum of understanding verification database incorporating some of the recommendations of the post-Phase VI deliberations. Additionally, UNMEE has instituted training sessions for both contingent and international staff members alike on the handling and processing of matters related to contingent-owned equipment. This will be ongoing as contingents and staff arrive in the Mission. Most recently, the UNMEE memorandum of understanding manager has received authorization for conducting a contingent-owned equipment/memorandum of understanding seminar for field inspectors and database managers in Cyprus. 6. The Committee continues to be concerned about the difficulties of recruiting qualified civilian personnel in a timely manner. The Committee will revert to this matter in due course (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 29). Most of the qualified (local) persons have been drafted in the army. Hence, the recruitment of skilled/experienced persons poses a significant problem. A way of alleviating the slow recruitment of international staff will be for the Staffing Support Unit in the Field Administration and Logistics Division to accept to consider objectively candidates submitted by Field Administration. 7. The Committee is of the opinion that the Mission should explore opportunities to make greater use of United Nations Volunteers in areas such as human rights, communications and public information activities. In this connection, the Committee welcomes the review initiated by the Mission of United Nations Volunteers staffing requirements for the 2001-2002 financial period with a view to exploring ways of increasing participation of Volunteers, in particular in the area of engineering support. In this connection, the Committee recalls, and reiterates, its views on the use of United Nations Volunteers in peacekeeping operations (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 31). Towards this end, the Mission has converted 40 national positions into UNV posts, bringing the total number of UNV positions earmarked for UNMEE to 82 posts, of which six and four, respectively, are earmarked for the Human Rights Unit and the Public Information Unit. Fourteen of the UNV positions have already been filled, and UNMEE is in the process of fielding the remaining 68. 8. The Committee notes that local salaries in Eritrea and Ethiopia are based on G-4 step IV of the salary scale (A/55/666, annex II, items 12 and 13). The Committee notes that the performance experience in some Missions show lower cost parameters (for example the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH)). The Committee believes that, in the light of experience, there is further room for adjustment in the estimates for local staff salaries (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 32) Provision of local staff salaries in the UNMEE cost estimate is based on the mid-point level of the approved salary scale, which is G-4 step IV. As of 4 May 2001, 165 local staff members were on board of whom the majority are employed at the G-2 (25.4 per cent) and G-3 (55.8 per cent) levels. The lower number of applicants in the G-4, G-5 and G-6 posts is mainly due to the high vacancy rate for specialized/technical personnel in such areas as engineering, electronic data-processing, communications and transport. The lack of candidates for these positions is mainly due to participation in military service at the border. With the establishment of the temporary security zone, UNMEE anticipates that these qualified personnel will be available for employment and encumber the vacant posts at the higher levels. Therefore, UNMEE suggests retaining the costing of the local staff salaries at the G-4 level. 9. The Committee sees no basis to make recommendations on post reductions, but requests that the continuing need of all the administrative civilian component positions be subject to regular review, based on evolving operational needs and workload. The Committee recommends acceptance of all the requests under the budget line item for "other equipment". Accordingly, the attendant productivity should also be taken into account in decisions regarding the ultimate level of personnel to be retained for administrative and civilian support. The Committee also requests that, where there is cooperation between the civilian and the military Full integration between the civilian and the military exists within the integrated support services, specifically in the fields of air operations, supply, contracts management, movement control and joint logistics operations control. Currently, there is no need for additional posts outside the nexus of post requirements already submitted to the Advisory Committee. sector, such as in movement control and logistics services, such cooperation be assessed in terms of what effect, if any, it might have on the need for additional posts (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 34). 10. The Committee requests that measures be in place for the effective management and control of the assets of the Mission. To this end, the Committee requests that the resident audit service (1 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 General Service and 1 local level), mentioned in the report be supplemented, as appropriate, with visits from the Office of Internal Oversight Services in accordance with the guidelines set out in the report of the Secretary-General on the use of resident auditors at peacekeeping missions (A/55/735) (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 40). A P-4 staff and a General Service staff member joined the mission in the last week of May 2001. CCPO will be requested to fill up the Local level post. The post of P-3 is presently vacant. On the basis of an assessment by the OIOS, the decision to fill up this post will be taken. 11. The Advisory Committee was informed that, at the time of review of the estimates, no direct flight link existed between Addis Ababa and Asmara. In this connection, the Committee trusts that timely action will be taken by all concerned to resolve this situation (A/55/688/Add.1, para. 41). UNMEE has reported to the Security Council that the use of the indirect route between Asmara and Addis Ababa will by 31 December 2001 have cost an additional $1.3 million, nearly doubling the cost. On 3 October 2001, members of the Security Council called on the parties to resolve the issue as a matter of urgency, and this is being followed up by the Secretariat and by UNMEE. 12. The Committee notes with concern that the status-of-forces agreements with the Governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea had not been signed at the time of examining the estimates (A/55/688/Add.1, para.42). Ethiopia signed the status-of-forces agreement on 23 March 2001. UNMEE is awaiting word from the Eritrean authorities on two issues: the first is a proposal that Eritrea promised to put before UNMEE, namely, possible alternatives regarding the testing of UNMEE personnel for HIV/AIDS. The second issue that is yet to be resolved is the request by the Eritrean authorities, that they vet all prospective local employees of UNMEE. The President of Eritrea has expressed directly to the Secretary-General his refusal to authorize the signing of the status-of-forces agreement in the absence of a United Nations agreement to compulsory testing for HIV/AIDS of all UNMEE personnel, which the Secretary-General made clear is not possible. The repeatedly expressed concern of the Security Council has yet to bring about any flexibility in the Eritrean position on this issue.
