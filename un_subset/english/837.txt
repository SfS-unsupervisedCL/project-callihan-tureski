UNITED A NATIONS General Assembly Distr. GENERAL A/RES/51/149 4 February 1997 Fifty-first session Agenda item 34 RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY [without reference to a Main Committee (A/51/L.44 and Add.1)] 51/149. Assistance in mine clearance The General Assembly, Recalling its resolutions 48/7 of 19 October 1993, 49/215 of 23 December 1994 and 50/82 of 14 December 1995 on assistance in mine clearance, all adopted without a vote, Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons, to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development, as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions, Reiterating its dismay at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, particularly children, and recalling in this context Commission on Human Rights resolutions 1995/79 of 8 March 1995See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1995, Supplement No. 3 and corrigenda (E/1995/23 and Corr.1 and 2), chap. II, sect. A. and 1996/85 of 24 April 1996See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1996, Supplement No. 3 (E/1996/23). on the rights of the child and 1996/27 of 19 April 19962 on the human rights of persons with disability, and noting the recent report on the impact of armed conflict on childrenA/51/306 and Add.1. prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General, Page Deeply alarmed that the number of mines being laid each year, as well as the presence of a large number of mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts, exponentially outweighs the number of such mines that can be cleared during that time, and thus convinced of the necessity and urgency of a significant increase in mine-clearance efforts by the international community, Noting the recent decisions taken at the Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects,CCW/CONF.I/16 (Part I). particularly with respect to Protocol II of the Convention and the inclusion in the Amended ProtocolIbid., annex B. of a number of provisions of importance for mine-clearance operations, notably the requirement of detectability, Noting also the adoption at the Ottawa International Strategy Conference, "Towards a Global Ban on Anti-Personnel Mines", on 5 October 1996, of the Ottawa Declaration,A/C.1/51/10, annex I. whereby participants undertook a commitment towards the earliest possible conclusion of a legally binding international agreement to ban anti-personnel mines and which, among other things, recognizes that the international community must provide significantly greater resources to mine-awareness programmes, mine-clearance operations and victim assistance, and stressing the need to convince mine-affected States to halt new deployments of anti-personnel mines to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of mine-clearance operations, and noting the offer by the Government of Belgium to host a follow-up conference at Brussels in June 1997, Welcoming the offer by the Government of Japan to hold at Tokyo a conference on anti-personnel landmines in March 1997 with a view to reinforcing international support for the work of the United Nations in landmine clearance, development of new technology for landmine detection and removal and the rehabilitation of landmine victims, Emphasizing the importance of recording the location of mines, of retaining all such records and making them available to concerned parties upon cessation of hostilities, and welcoming the strengthening of the relevant provisions in international law, Recognizing the important role that the international community, particularly States involved in the deployment of mines, can play in assisting mine clearance in affected countries through the provision of necessary maps and information and appropriate technical and material assistance to remove or otherwise render ineffective existing minefields, mines and booby-traps, Bearing in mind the serious threat that mines and other unexploded devices pose to the safety, health and lives of personnel participating in humanitarian, peacekeeping and rehabilitation programmes and operations, Aware that the rate of mine clearance needs to accelerate substantially if the global landmine problem is to be tackled effectively, Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology, and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end, Encouraged by the initiative taken by the Government of Denmark in hosting and organizing the International Conference on Mine Clearance Technology at Elsinore from 2 to 4 July 1996See A/51/472, annex. with the support and cooperation of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat and by the work of the Conference, notably in relation to international standards and procedures for humanitarian mine-clearance operations, which can serve as a basis on which to advance the safety, effectiveness and professionalism of these operations throughout the world, Recognizing that, in addition to the primary role of States, the United Nations has an important role in the field of assistance in mine clearance, Noting with satisfaction the inclusion in the mandates of several peacekeeping operations of provisions relating to mine-clearance work carried out under the direction of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat, in the context of such operations, Commending the activities already undertaken by the United Nations system, donor and recipient Governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations to coordinate their efforts and seek solutions to the problems related to the presence of mines and other unexploded devices, Also commending the role of the Secretary-General, through the work of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, in increasing public awareness of the problem of landmines, and in the establishment of the central landmine database and inventories of mine-awareness materials and mine-clearance techniques, Welcoming the statement by the President of the Security Council at the 3693rd meeting of the Council, on 30 August 1996, on demining in the context of United Nations peacekeeping,Official Records of the Security Council, Fifty-first Year, Resolutions and Decisions of the Security Council, 1996, document S/PRST/1996/37. 1.
