General Assembly Sixtieth session Agenda item 14 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Sixty-first year Identical letters dated 5 August 2006 from the Permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council Upon instructions from my Government, I wish to transmit the following letter of the Syrian Arab Republic on the massacre at Alqa'a, which was perpetrated by Israel in Lebanon yesterday, resulting in the death of 33 Syrian and Lebanese civilian victims, among them 26 Syrian civilian nationals (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annex circulated immediately as a document of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 14, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Bashar Ja'afari Ambassador Permanent Representative [Original: Arabic] Israel has continued its series of massacres and its invasion of Lebanon, as its warplanes deliberately murdered, on 4 August, 33 Syrian and Lebanese civilians and injured 12 others, who were eating lunch after finishing their work of loading food supplies for the Lebanese. Among the victims were 26 Syrian civilians, which was another provocation of Syria by Israel through its aggression against Lebanon. This massacre is yet another in the series of massacres perpetrated by Israel in its ongoing aggression against Lebanon since 12 July that have claimed the lives of more than a thousand innocent civilians, including the second massacre at Qana. Preventing the Security Council from assuming its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security and the failure to hold accountable those who murdered United Nations peacekeepers and to halt the Israeli aggression against Lebanon for almost a month have led to the perpetration of the second massacre at Qana, and the massacre at Alqa'a, and to the death of such large numbers of innocent civilians. Moreover, preventing the Council from putting an end to Israel's state terrorism and the war crimes it has been committing against Lebanon without any deterrent is but a systematic destruction of all the norms subscribed to by humanity in the Charter of the United Nations, international law and international humanitarian law, particularly the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Syria supports the immediate discharge by the fact-finding commission on the second massacre at Qana of its functions and the extension of its mandate to cover the massacre at Alqa'a. Syria demands full Israeli reparations for the families of the Syrian civilians murdered by Israel in its current aggression, particularly of those who died in the recent massacre at Alqa'a. Syria also supports the demand by Lebanon that Israel be compelled to pay reparations for the massacres at Qana and Alqa'a and its destruction of installations and infrastructure in Lebanon. The ongoing undeterred Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the prospects of its expansion, together with the attendant risks to Lebanon, the peoples of the Middle East and the entire world, make it incumbent upon the international community to rally and mobilize its strength against Israel and the sponsors of war and aggression, and seek an immediate, unconditional ceasefire. For such a ceasefire to endure, Israel must withdraw to behind the Blue Line, in order not to be allowed to achieve any gains through its aggression and its state terrorism. It has also become clear to all observers of the situation in the Middle East that the only way to put and end to the cycle of violence in the region is through a just and lasting solution to the Middle East problem based on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and ending the Israeli occupation of all the occupied Arab Territories.
