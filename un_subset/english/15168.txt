This addendum updates the information contained in the report of the Secretary-General to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2001/59). I. FINANCIAL STATUS 2. On the eve of the twentieth session of the Board of Trustees of the Fund (18 May1 June 2001), a total of US$ 1,079,516 had been received to provide humanitarian assistance to victims of torture and to members of their families. Table 1 below, drawn up on 4 April 2001 on the basis of the information available to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, updates table 1 of the main report by providing information on contributions recorded by the United Nations Treasurer after 15 December 2000 (see E/CN.4/2001/59). Canada, Cyprus and Iceland have paid a new contribution for 2001, as recommended by the Commission in its resolution 2000/43 of 2 April 2000. Table 1. Recently paid contributions that will be taken into consideration at the twentieth session of the Board of Trustees (to be added to table 1 of E/CN.4/2001/59) State Amount (US$) Recorded Intended for Contr.

The total amount pledged is about US$ 7 million (see table 2 below). Pledges need to be paid by 30 April 2001 if they are to be recorded by the United Nations Treasurer and allocated at the twentieth session of the Board of Trustees.

Office but not received by the United Nations Treasurer or OHCHR Geneva. c The payment of $130,000 for 1999 was apparently paid to the United Nations Office for Project Services (this is now being checked by the OHCHR administration). II. NEEDS ASSESSMENT 4. At the time of writing (4 April 2001), the total amount of grants requested by nongovernmental organizations for 2001 was about US$ 11 million whereas some US$ 10 million were requested in 2000 (see E/CN.4/2001/59, table 3). The upward trend observed since 1997 has therefore continued. 5. As the Fund has so far received contributions amounting to only about US$ 1 million, the amount needed by 30 April 2001 to satisfy all the requests for funding received from nongovernmental organizations would be over US$ 13 million since, in addition to the amount needed for grants, an additional 13 per cent would be required to cover programme support costs and a further 15 per cent to provide the compulsory operating cash reserve, in accordance with the United Nations rules on the administration of United Nations general trust funds for humanitarian assistance. III. FUND-RAISING 6. In the light of the alarming financial situation of the Fund, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Jaap Walkate (Netherlands), launched an urgent appeal to regular donors through their Permanent Missions to the United Nations Office at Geneva (see annex). The aim of this appeal was to remind them that their contributions to the Fund should be paid before 30 April 2001 so that they could be recorded at the twentieth session of the Board. 7. In accordance with past practice of the Bureau of the Commission on Human Rights, whereby the Chairman or a member of the Board of Trustees present in Geneva is invited to present the report of the Secretary-General to the Commission, a member of the Board, Ivan Tosevski, will address the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session, under the relevant agenda item, to give interested Governments and non-governmental organizations the latest information on the needs of the Fund. 8. At the end of its twentieth session, the Board of Trustees will hold a briefing for donors, as it does every year, on the allocation and use of contributions received. The briefing is planned for Friday, 1 June 2001, at 3 p.m. IV. HOW TO CONTRIBUTE 9.

LETTER DATED 27 MARCH 2001 FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE FUND ADDRESSED TO THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES OF REGULAR DONORS TO THE FUND TO THE UNITED NATIONS OFFICE AT GENEVA Dear Ambassador, We very much appreciate the regular and substantial contribution of your Government to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. I have the honour to bring to your attention several provisions of General Assembly resolution 55/89 of 4 December 2000 (para. 23), Commission on Human Rights resolution 2000/43 of 20 April 2000 (para. 36), the Joint Appeal of 26 June 2000 by the Board of Trustees of the Fund, the Committee against Torture, the Special Rapporteur on torture and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the appeal letter of 18 October 2000 by the High Commissioner, appealing for new contributions to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. The General Assembly, the Commission, the Board of Trustees of the Fund, the Committee against Torture, the Special Rapporteur on torture and the High Commissioner expressed gratitude and appreciation to Governments having contributed to the Fund and appealed to all Governments to respond favourably to requests for contributions to the Fund, if possible on a regular basis and annually before the session of the Board of Trustees of the Fund. To satisfy the ever-increasing demand for assistance, they recommended that Governments increase substantially the level of contributions. The next session of the Board is scheduled to take place from 18 May to 1 June 2001. Contributions should be paid before the session of the Board, since the Board, when making recommendations for grants, can only take into consideration contributions paid and duly recorded by the United Nations Treasurer. Requests for assistance for 2001 amount to some US$ 11 million. However, the Fund has so far received contributions amounting to only about US$ 1 million. I would therefore very much appreciate if you could kindly make the necessary arrangements to ensure that your regular contribution is paid before the end of April 2001 at latest, in order for the Board to be able to take into consideration the contributions duly registered by the United Nations Treasurer and to fulfil its mandate. On behalf of the Board of Trustees, and on my own behalf, I thank you in advance for your cooperation. I remain, dear Ambassador, (Signed) Jaap WALKATE Chairman, Board of Trustees, To all donors to the Fund
