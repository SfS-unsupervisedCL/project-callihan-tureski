Identical letters dated 1 December 2009 from the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council I write this letter of complaint regarding a series of attacks emanating from the Gaza Strip which is controlled by the Hamas terrorist organization. On 13 November 2009, a rocket was launched from the Gaza Strip, and between 18 November 2009 and 24 November 2009 four additional rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip. Furthermore, on 16 November 2009, two mortar shells were fired from Gaza. All of these rockets and mortars landed in the Western Negev region of Israel adjacent to many small cities. While such attacks intentionally target Israeli civilians, no serious casualties or damage was sustained. I wish to reiterate that in response to these armed attacks, and in exercise of its inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, Israel will take all necessary measures to protect its citizens from the threat of terrorism. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter distributed as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Gabriela Shalev Ambassador Permanent Representative
