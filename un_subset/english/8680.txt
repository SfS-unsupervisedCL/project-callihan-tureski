The Arab Lawyers Union (ALU) is a pan-Arab confederation of Arab bar associations and law societies established in 1944. ALU has now achieved the affiliation of 27 member organizations with a total individual membership of over 300,000 lawyers. ALU targets pooling its member bar associations’ efforts and orchestrates their activities to enhance the independence of the legal profession, rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms and popular participation in the Arab world and internationally, by forging an Arab public consensus based on internationally recognized norms and principles enshrined in the United Nations human rights instruments spelling out the duties and obligations undertaken by each State party. Nowadays ALU exerts efforts to survive financial difficulties owing to the deteriorating financial situation of the member bar associations and law societies caused by sanctions imposed on Iraq and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the deadlock of the peace process in the Middle East and other international crises. Nonetheless, by virtue of ALU’s membership in the Board and Bureau of the Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council and its main special committees ALU has been a co-partner in all the initiatives embarked upon by CONGO members during this period.

(Special consultative status granted 1978) Catholic Relief Services (CRS) is the official overseas relief and development agency of the United States Catholic Conference (USCC). CRS was founded in 1943 to assist refugees and displaced peoples in Europe after the Second World War. The Mission of CRS is to alleviate human suffering, aid the development of peoples, and foster charity and justice in the world. CRS assists people on the basis of need, not creed, race, nationality, sex, or political views. After the Second World War, CRS identified global needs and expanded rapidly throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. During the period 1994–1997, in response to needs and world events, CRS expanded its operations in Eastern Europe (Bosnia, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, and Albania), Asia (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea owing to famine and also in Indonesia), Africa (the Great Lakes region and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (former Zaire), and Latin American and the Caribbean (disaster relief in Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Today, CRS provides assistance in 82 countries and territories worldwide. CRS receives funding from public and private donors in the United States of America and overseas. Annual programme value averages from US$ 220–US$ 300 million. Working with local counterpart organizations, CRS promotes justice through the provision of refugee aid and disaster relief, and long-term sustainable development assistance programmes in various sectors: health, agriculture, education, village banking (with women’s village solidarity groups) and general welfare aid to the destitute and the marginalized. Cross-cutting themes in all CRS programmes include promotion of civil society, peace and reconciliation, and gender equity. In many countries, CRS has cooperative relationships with United Nations agencies, such as the World Food Programme (WFP), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). As requested, CRS field offices share information with United Nations agencies and participate actively in United Nations forums, meetings and seminars, especially at the country level. From 1994 to 1997, CRS increasingly diversified its funding base to a global network of public and private donors that share a common world vision and values. CRS actively collaborates with the United Nations agencies and other international donors. CRS is also an active member of international Catholic development and relief consortia, including Caritas Internationalis (CI) and the Northern Hemisphere Catholic development agency consortium, known as CIDSE (International Cooperation for Development and Solidarity). Participation in United Nations forums CRS participated periodically in non-governmental organization-Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat disaster meetings in New York. CRS attended the “Rio Plus 5” Conference in New York in 1997. CRS Viet Nam staff represented CRS at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in 1995. The CRS Department of Governmental Relations Director and Food Security Advisor both represented CRS at the World Food Summit in Rome in 1996. Catholic development agency consortia (CIDSE and Caritas Internationalis) submitted a paper to the World Summit for Social Development in March 1995. Cooperation with United Nations programmes and agencies The major operational relationships of CRS are with WFP and UNHCR on famine and disaster relief, and aid to refugees. In June 1995, the Executive Director of CRS signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the WFP Director, primarily regarding emergency relief. In March 1996, the Memorandum of Understanding was expanded to include non-emergency development and to put a higher priority on improving the situation of women. CRS participated in non-governmental organization operational partnership agreement negotiations with UNHCR. CRS has engaged in partnerships with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UNDP and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). UNICEF provides in-kind support such as high-energy biscuits, powdered milk, vitamin A and deworming medicine. Cumulatively, United Nations agency cash grants alone to CRS in 1997 totalled $4,774,171. Through different channels and using different approaches, the United Nations and CRS often engage in complementary efforts to transform conflict, promote peace and reconciliation, support the development of civil society and buttress human rights and democracy. These common aims are most often pursued jointly in the context of disaster relief and long-term development programmes. Consultations and cooperation with the United Nations The United Nations provided funding and engaged in partnership with CRS, primarily at the field level, from 1994 to 1997 in several regions of the world: (a) Africa: In Southern Africa, the International Organization for Migration/Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat funded CRS in Angola in 1996–1997 to manage quartering areas for demobilization of ex-combatants, to raise mine awareness and to aid the internally displaced. In the Great Lakes region, from 1994 on, WFP, UNICEF and FAO supported CRS disaster relief and reconciliation among internally displaced and host populations in Burundi; in East Africa, UNICEF funded CRS Child Survival in north-east Kenya. In West Africa, WFP and FAO supported CRS disaster relief and aid to refugees and internally displaced peoples in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and in 1995–1996, UNHCR/WFP funded CRS food aid to Tuareg refugees in Burkina Faso; (b) Asia: In the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in 1997, CRS and four other United States non-governmental organizations began a joint operation with WFP to provide famine relief. In the Philippines, UNICEF, along with CRS and other non-governmental organizations, produced a training manual entitled “A Culture of Peace” for use in Mindanao; (c) Europe, Middle East, North Africa: UNHCR supported CRS Bosnia programmes of rehabilitation and reintegration, minority refugee return, and aid to internally displaced peoples; UNDP in Croatia supported CRS micro-loans to refugees returning to homes of origin; in Kosovo and Albania, UNHCR funded CRS aid to refugees and the internally displaced; in the Middle East, CRS worked in coordination with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) (provision of aid to Palestinian refugees) in Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; (d) Latin America and the Caribbean: In 1995–1996, CRS cooperated with WFP on drought relief in north-east Brazil. CRS has distributed food aid provided by the United Nations in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Honduras. A CRS report stated that in the past year, 10 field offices participated in United Nations food assisted development and relief programmes totalling 4,200 metric tons, valued at $1,345,000. In 1997, CRS was pleased to note, as a sign of growing partnership, that cash funding from United Nations agencies had risen 97 per cent from 1996, to $2,347,743. UNHCR funding alone was up $1,850,744 from 1996. Based on shared visions and values, CRS seeks to continue expanding its collaboration with the United Nations and its member agencies on behalf of the poor, both centrally and through field-based development and relief operations. CRS, as a member of international Catholic development and relief consortia, also hopes to expand its advocacy within the United Nations system regarding global issues such as debt relief, conflict resolution and the promotion of civil society and basic human rights. (Special consultative status granted 1985) Introductory statement Established in 1938 and based in Richmond, Virginia, Christian Children’s Fund (CCF) is one of the world’s oldest and largest child development agencies. For 60 years, the organization has been committed to the survival, protection and development of children through one-on-one child sponsorship. At the present time, CCF’s programmes in health and education touch the lives of over 2.5 million needy children in 31 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the United States of America. In addition, eight “international affiliate” organizations in Australia, Denmark, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden and Taiwan Province of China help to promote CCF’s programmes and enlist sponsors in Europe and Asia. Affiliates in France and New Zealand became independent autonomous organizations during this period, and BARNfonden/Sweden joined the membership in 1997. The main source of CCF’s funding continues to be individual sponsors who contributed over $96 million (US) to CCF programmes by the end of fiscal year 1997, representing an increase of $30 million in sponsorship revenue since 1994. CCF is committed to ensuring that at least 80 per cent of the sponsor’s donation goes to benefit programme services for children and their families. During this period, CCF has also expanded its funding base in the area of grants and contracts, mainly through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. Grant funding had increased since 1994 from approximately $980,000 to over $3 million (US) by the end of 1997. An Endowment fund, named in honour of an early Executive Director, Dr. Verent Mills, was also established during this period in support of health and education programmes to benefit children in CCF’s worldwide projects. A pivotal development during the past four years has been CCF’s establishment of a new evaluation system called AIMES (Annual Impact Monitoring and Evaluation System), which has provided an unprecedented level of accountability across all of the organization’s field programmes. Based on detailed indicators in health and education compiled at the field level, this new system allows CCF to measure the impact of our assistance on each sponsored child, then prioritize and target service delivery accordingly. The system emphasizes the linkage and accountability between CCF, the sponsor and the child and seeks to promote and replicate “best practices” in CCF’s field programming for children and families. To further enhance CCF’s overall accountability, CCF introduced in 1996 a new “Network Auditing” system, designed to ensure that its 1,200 projects are audited on a regular basis through a combination of local auditors, Coopers and Lybrand, or CCF’s Internal Audit Unit. It also seeks to provide complementarity between the aforementioned AIMES data, as well as other key indicators in sponsorship and financial management. In addition, CCF has maintained its affiliations with other international non-governmental organizations in consultative status with ECOSOC such as World Vision International, the International Save the Children Alliance, Plan International and others working on behalf of children’s rights and development. In particular, these four agencies have collaborated at the global level with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in support of the goals of the World Summit for Children in launching a joint initiative to promote girl’s education in six different countries. This ongoing initiative was recognized by the Director of UNICEF’s Programme Division, Mr. Sadiq Rasheed, in his annual statement to the Executive Board of UNICEF in June 1998. In that same statement, Mr. Rasheed acknowledged the specific cooperation between CCF and UNICEF in Angola by “training over 1,500 community members to give psychosocial support to over 17,000 war-traumatized children, including underage soldiers”. CCF’s programme in Angola was also acknowledged in UNICEF’s annual report, The State of the World’s Children, 1996 (New York, Oxford University Press, 1996) (p. 24, figure 1 entitled “Angolan children in war”) focusing on child victims of armed conflict and the measures required for rehabilitation and reintegration into their societies. In support of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Culture of Peace Programme and the General Assembly’s proclamation, in its resolution 52/15 of 20 November 1997, of the year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace, the Psychologists for Social Responsibility awarded CCF its “Distinguished Contribution to the Culture of Peace” Award in August 1998 for its programme in Angola. Participation in the Economic and Social Council and/or other cooperation with United Nations programmes, bodies and specialized agencies During the past four years, CCF has maintained close relations with UNICEF through its expanding role on the NGO Committee on UNICEF, which itself enjoys consultative status with the Executive Board of UNICEF. The former President of CCF, Dr. Paul McCleary, concluded his term as the President of the NGO Committee on UNICEF in 1994 prior to his retirement. From 1995 to 1997, CCF representatives Mr. Arthur Simon (CCF-Washington Director) and Dr. Michelle Poulton (CCF-Geneva Director) continued CCF’s representation on the Board of the NGO Committee in New York and Geneva, respectively. In June 1997, Dr. Poulton was elected Deputy President of the NGO Committee on UNICEF. In this capacity, CCF has regularly attended scheduled meetings of the Committee Board in Geneva in addition to key New York meetings and that of UNICEF. As further evidence of this cooperative trend, CCF collaborated with the Belarusian Children’s Fund and UNICEF in November 1994 to host a conference in Minsk focusing on the rights of the child. In addition, UNICEF and CCF also collaborated to provide social work education to Belorussian University professors through an exchange programme between Belorussian, American and European social work experts. A regional seminar, with UNICEF support, was also convened by CCF in Estonia in 1995, which focused on support for the family in the Baltic States. CCF-Geneva has also strengthened its contacts with other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations in Geneva during this time and has played a leadership role with other non-governmental organization committee members in the ongoing dialogue on making the committee more decentralized and issue-oriented. In view of CCF’s rehabilitative, psychosocial programming in Angola and Sierra Leone, CCF has also supported events surrounding the release of the United Nations–sponsored study by Graca Machel relating to the impact of armed conflict on children. CCF has also been active in promoting the importance of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, has followed the activities of the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and has also become a signatory to non-governmental organization-led initiatives urging the United States Congress to ratify the Convention. CCF National Offices also promote the United Nations Convention in the overall context of children’s rights and development in their own countries, and some are active in National Councils/Committees on the Rights of the Child. At the same time, CCF National Offices interact directly with UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Bank and other agencies at the field level in support of organizational priorities relating to child development. In summary, CCF remains committed to and supportive of the short- and long-term goals of the United Nations system, and subscribes to the belief that the programme interventions of international non-governmental organizations as well as of their local and national counterparts can serve to complement the programmes of the United Nations system as we continue to work together in partnership. The Consultative Council of Jewish Organizations (CCJO) was founded in 1947 by Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, René Cassin, first President of the European Court of Human Rights, principal author of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and President of the Alliance Israélite Universelle. Since its establishment, CCJO and its constituent organizations, the Alliance Israélite Universelle, the American Friends of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, the Anglo-Jewish Association and the Canadian Friends of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, have been actively participating with the United Nations and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in organizing programmes and developing projects on issues related to human rights, international law and education. From 1947 through the late 1980s CCJO focused its activities in New York, Where it sponsored conferences on such topics as the Abuse of human rights in the Soviet Union, and Strategies to implement the International Covenants on Human Rights. In the early 1990s, a decision was made to shift CCJO’s focus and resources by expanding its presence in Europe, through its participation with the United Nations and UNESCO in Geneva and Paris and to increase its exposure to the community through the sponsorship of programmes and academic conferences. The CCJO’s European offices has been based in Paris under the direction of Gérard Israël, author and expert on international law and political affairs. After serving for over 25 years, Mr. Israël retired and a Search Committee has been formed and is in the process of finding a replacement. In addition, CCJO is represented in London by Clemens N. Nathan, a Jewish communal leader and in Montreal by Gary Waxman and Edmond Elbaz, two communal leaders. Currently, an Italian branch of CCJO is being established in Milan. During the period 1994–1997, CCJO’s activities have included: (a) Participating in the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva: representatives of CCJO’s European offices have attended and actively participated in the Commission on Human Rights convened annually in Geneva. Their involvement included: Presentation of reports on the right of restitution, compensation and rehabilitation for victims of gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/8), the administration of justice and the human rights of detainees (E/CN.4/Sub.2/ 1995/NGO/38) and protection des minorités: examen global de sujets précis relatifs au racisme, à la xénophobie, aux minorités et aux travailleurs migrants (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2/1995/NGO/40) on 9 August 1995; (b) United Nations and UNESCO activities: CCJO’s offices participated in United Nations and UNESCO projects in Paris and Geneva, which included: (i) Serving as a member of the Liaison Committee of French non-governmental organizations to the United Nations Office in Paris; (ii) Serving as a consultant to the Executive Committee and General Conference of UNESCO in Paris and Geneva in matters related to human rights, law and education; (iii) Sending a delegation to participate in the Sub-commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, held in Geneva in August 1997; (c) Carrying on the work of René Cassin in the field of human rights, as follows: (i) The Canadian Friends of the Alliance Israélite Universelle have sponsored an annual René Cassin Symposium at McGill University in Montreal. Keynote speakers have included Professor Thomas S. Kuttner and Professor Irwin Cottler, experts on human rights, Judge Jules Deschênes, Chairman of a government commission investigating Nazi war criminals in Canada, and Dr. Bernard Kouchner, a researcher who spoke on racism and xenophobia; (ii) Working with the Association pour la Fidelité à la Pensée du Président René Cassin, which promotes the efforts of the late Nobel Prize Laureate in the area of international law; (iii) Collaborating with the International Institute of Human Rights to promote the development of educational material on the subject, as well as to distribute academic prizes and student scholarships; (d) Miscellaneous activities: (i) Served as a consultant to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, in matters pertaining to human rights; (ii) Co-sponsored a colloquium on “The Struggle Against Racism and Xenophobia” in Strasbourg in November 1994; (iii) Assisted the French National Commission on Human Rights by addressing such issues as educational approaches to teaching about human rights, educational reform, nationality and minority rights, and drug and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) education; (iv) Participated in the United Nations Caucus of Jewish non-governmental organizations sponsored by B’nai B’rith International’s United Nations Affairs Department in New York; (v) Sent a delegation to participate in the Yitzhak Rabin Annual Conference on the United Nations sponsored by the B’nai B’rith Centre for Public Policy in September 1997; (e) Activities of CCJO’s constituent organizations: (i) CCJO’s constituent organizations have supported the goals of CCJO by planning programmes on various aspects of human rights and interfaith relations, a symposium on the Middle East peace process sponsored by the Alliance Israélite Universelle in Paris in November 1995; (ii) They disseminate information about the goals, programmes, projects and activities of CCJO through the publications of its constituent organizations. These journals include The Alliance Review (New York), The AJA Review (London), Les Cahiers de l’Alliance Israélite Universelle and Les Cahiers du Judaïsme (Paris) and Bita’ on KYACH (Jerusalem). It is the hope of CCJO and its constituent organizations to continue its mission of assisting the United Nations in eliminating racial and religious intolerance, violations of human rights and promoting the cause of freedom. We look forward in the coming months to joining our sister organizations in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights co-authored by our organization’s founder, the late René Cassin. The European Federation of Conference Towns (EFCT) was founded in 1963 as a professional association for those special towns in Europe which are dedicated to the development of modern, efficient conference destinations, complete with the infrastructure, facilities and services that make this possible. Since then, while retaining these essential aims and objectives, EFCT has moved ahead and enlarged its horizons. Thanks in a significant part to EFCT’s leadership and communication programme, it has become more widely recognized that conferences and congresses are a vital component of the communication processes which all countries have to depend on, if social and economic progress and development are to be maintained. Assistance to the European Union More than any other body, EFCT has assisted the European Community to understand the importance of a strong European conference industry, and the value of attracting international congresses that play a major role in professional and social interchange and development. For many years EFCT maintained a Liaison Office in Brussels in continuing contact with the Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg headquarters of the European Union (EU), concerning the many matters relating to conferences that can crop up in legislation. Three years ago, EFCT offered participation to other professional groups and set up a new office called EMILG, (the European Meetings Industry Liaison Group), also in Brussels. The first to join EFCT in this were IAPCO (International Association of Professional Congress Organisers), ICCA (the International Congress and Convention Association) and MPI (Meeting Professionals International). Others have followed. EFCT retains the Chair of this cooperative group. EMILG is an accepted voice of the industry, and works on all aspects of EU activity and legislation. It attends relevant EU meetings, and an instance recently was the Conference on Quality in Tourism, organized by the current Austrian EU Presidency, in which the EMILG Chairman was a featured speaker. EFCT was awarded consultative status with the Economic and Social Council in 1978; we have ever since regarded this distinction with pride, and done all we can to justify it. Setting up EMILG has increased our ability to fulfil the Council’s role. We try to keep EFCT members (a hundred of Europe’s top destination cities) and the other cooperating groups advised about developments that might involve the Economic and Social Council. These include, for instance, the convention against torture, child rights, elimination of racial discrimination, protection of minorities, freedom of movement, intellectual protection, research cooperation, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), protection of the environment and cooperation between developed and emerging countries. We campaign always to emphasize the role of meetings and conferences as a key instrument for peace, well-being, international cooperation, professional interchange, the exchange of scientific activity and technology and the improvement of skills in almost every discipline. This was the second year of the European Union, and the new European Economic Area (EEA) was established, including Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland; for several it was a halfway house towards full membership. Surveys indicated that conference delegates were spending more — an increase of 52 per cent — between 1985 and 1993. During this year EFCT took its annual conference to Helsinki where the Federation’s thirtieth birthday was celebrated. A survey of those years was published in EFCT at 30. We reminded the European Union that although tourism was Europe’s biggest industry, with 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and also the biggest employer, it had been omitted from the Treaty of Rome and as a result there was no EU policy or activity on the subject. We suggested this was a situation that should be rectified, and there was widespread support throughout the tourism industry for this attitude. Our aim was that when the Treaty was to be reassessed in Maastricht in 1996, tourism would at last be recognized by the Community. The EC’s own Economic and Social Council shared our concern. We were active in lobbying on the proposed distance selling draft legislation, which included several aspects detrimental to business tourism. Our sixth Report on Europe was published in the spring; it showed some optimism that the market situation was improving. EFCT’s eighth Summer School took place this year in Brussels. EFCT stressed its support for the European environmental programme by joining Green Globe, an agency established by the World Travel and Tourism Council. The European Parliament voted to include tourism in the EU programme and called for a Tourism Agency to work alongside the European Environmental Agency. But this was not supported by the Governments of several influential EU nations, and little progress was made. A big step was the enlargement of the European Union to include Austria, Finland and Sweden, making a total of 15 countries. We noted that the newcomers were all prominent conference countries, with leading cities that were EFCT members. A number of new convention bureaux were established, including in Stockholm and Tampere. New EFCT members included Bratislava (Slovakia), Istanbul (Turkey), Le Mans (France), Limassol (Cyprus), Montlucon (France) and Reykjavik (Iceland). Our Summer School went to Innsbruck; our annual Report on Europe emphasized the importance of the Single Market and indicated a continuing improvement in the market situation across Europe. This year EFCT was one of the first in the meetings world to adopt the Internet, and has been prominent ever since. The Commissioner for the European Union’s Twenty-third Directorate-General, Christos Papoutsis, wrote to congratulate EFCT on its role in Europe, saying it had succeeded for Europe in winning 60 per cent of all the international congresses. Its role in Europe, he added, had provided a great service and substantial investment to the host communities, all stemming from the establishment of EFCT in Brussels 30 years earlier. This year EFCT started a two-year term as Chair and Secretariat of JMIC, the Joint Meetings Industry Group, which involves 15 of the leading professional organizations worldwide. There was wide concern when EU refused to vote a tourism budget for the coming year. The First International Congress for Children on the Environment took place in Eastbourne, an EFCT member city, this year. A United Nations survey of 30,000 children formed part of the agenda, and heads of State and politicians worldwide gave support. Eight hundred children from 85 countries participated, and the wide range of projects around the world captured the imagination of the media. The delegates made 25 resolutions, and the United Nations circulated these widely from New York. The Twenty-third Directorate-General of the European Commission issued a Green Paper on the future of tourism within the Common Market; EFCT was a major contributor thereto and to the discussion that followed. High hopes were raised, but after months of delay and opposition from major member States it was shelved. A working lunch for politicians from European countries was held at the annual EIBTM trade show in Geneva, setting a pattern for an annual event where they could discuss the conference market informally with other politicians and with the representatives of EFCT and other professional bodies. EFCT’s ninth Report on Europe showed how conference activity in Eastern European cities was increasing, and acknowledged the Federation’s programme of assistance to emerging destinations. This year EFCT celebrated the hundredth anniversary of the world’s first convention bureau, in Detroit, Michigan; at an anniversary conference in that city we presented a paper on the European conference scene. This year our annual conference was in Warsaw, and the Summer School went to Nice. EFCT gave strong support to a project from the Twenty-third Directorate-General called Philoxenia, which stemmed from the Green Paper the previous year. This provided modest support for congress promotion on behalf of Europe and had other features welcomed by the industry. Sadly it was opposed by major member States, and never really started. This and other hopeful proposals from the EU Commissioner for the Twenty-third Directorate-General were also due for discussion at the Inter-government Conference which moved from Florence to Dublin this year, but they never came to the floor. Meetings on tourism were cancelled. Tampere was nominated by EFCT for this year’s Green Globe Award, and was voted the winner. EFCT supported ETAG, the European Tourism Action Group, in calling for improvement in value-added tax (VAT) restrictions and freedom from other taxes such as the airport departure tax. We asked for better statistics and closer cooperation between the Government and private sectors. We supported the strong EU stance against the commercial exploitation of children, and a call for practical action by the travel trade. This year, the EFCT Summer School was held in Barcelona and the annual conference went to Reykjavik. EFCT presented a paper on business travel at a regional conference in Porto, which was widely distributed. The EU Presidency moved from Ireland to Luxembourg, and a conference there on tourism and employment emphasized the role played by tourism in general and business tourism in particular in combating the major Community problem of finding new jobs; but there was little progress in the attempt to have tourism and conferences included in the official business of the European Union. The annual meeting with representative politicians was successful and our educational programme, including parliamentarians, hotel schools and many professional people, continued. EFCT this year endorsed Istanbul Convention Bureau and the Turkish Soil Erosion Control Association jointly for the Green Globe Award, and this partnership was successful. EFCT nominations have now won this environmental accolade for two successive years. Summary During the four years under review, EFCT has been more active than ever and has continued to accept the responsibilities of consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. We plan to continue this pattern and do all we can to further the activities of the Council and draw attention to its achievements and programme. 8. World Jewish Congress (WJC) (Special consultative status granted 1941) Brief introductory statement The period covered by this quadrennial report 1994–1997 has been marked by significant changes on the international scene, not least of which is the evolving character of the former Soviet Union. As a result of the affiliation of several Jewish communities in the former Soviet Union with the World Jewish Congress (WJC), there are almost 90 Jewish communities that are WJC national members. WJC continues to maintain links with the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies through, inter alia, the two principal human rights organs, the Commission on Human Rights and the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. WJC’s active participation in all sessions of these bodies is detailed below, as is the evidence of our ongoing engagement with the treaty body process. WJC continues to follow with great interest the work of the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Committee Against Torture, and the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The organization has also had a special interest over the past four years in pursuing redress for wrongs suffered by former victims of the Nazi regime during the Second World War, pursuant to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Representations have been made to authorities of neutral Second World War countries on behalf of persons, or their successors, entitled to restitution for assets entrusted to banks, or other institutions, such as insurance companies, fiduciaries and so on, in addition to requests that appropriate measures be taken for property of heirless victims to be applied for other surviving victims of the Holocaust who are in need. Activities WJC participated in the fiftieth, fifty-first, fifty-second, fifty-third and fifty-fourth sessions of the Commission on Human Rights. Oral statements were made on the following subjects: (a) At the fifty-fourth session, on 24 March 1998, on agenda item 14: Effective functioning of bodies established pursuant to United Nations human rights instruments; (b) Also at the fifty-fourth session, on 23 March 1998, on agenda item 12: Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; (c) At the fifty-third session, on 24 March 1997, on agenda item 19: Implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief; (d) Also at the fifty-third session, on 11 March 1997, on the mandate of a Special Rapporteur; (e) At the fifty-second session, on 9 April 1996, on the topic of agenda reform; (f) Also at the fifty-second, on 21 March 1996, on agenda item 4: Situation of human rights in the Occupied Territories; (g) At the fifty-first session, under agenda item 11, on terrorism. WJC took part in the forty-sixth, forty-seventh and forty-ninth sessions of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. WJC attended the last four sessions of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. WJC has closely followed the question of liberal asylum policies and the increasing phenomenon of refoulement. A statement was made by the representative of WJC on the occasion of Human Rights Day on 10 December 1997. WJC attended, and made a statement at, the Meeting of Government Experts on the Use of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Emblems, held on 13 and 14 February 1997. At the Webster University Conference on “War Crimes in Yugoslavia: Peace or Justice”, a WJC representative delivered a speech on the topic “Geneva and the Challenge of Humanitarian Action in the 1990s”, on 15 February 1996. A speech entitled “The United Nations and Israel” was delivered to the Tenth International Conference of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, held on 29 December 1995. As part of WJC’s ongoing involvement in reform of the Red Cross movement, a representative attended the Twenty-sixth International Conference of the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and made a statement on 5 December 1995. WJC participated in the Economic and Social Council Forum on Non-Governmental Organizations and Development, held on 3 July 1995, and made a statement on that occasion. A WJC representative presented a paper entitled “The Treatment of Israel and the Rise of Economic ‘Rights’ in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights” to the American Society of International Law 1995 Annual Meeting held from 5 to 8 April 1995. A speech was delivered by a WJC representative to the Fourteenth Regional Conference of European United Nations Associations on 7 November 1994. WJC continues to maintain a high level of interest in United Nations treaty bodies. Sessions of the following treaty bodies were attended by WJC representatives, and informal representation to Chairmen and/or Committee members was made with respect to issues arising in particular country reports on several occasions: (a) Human Rights Committee (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights); (b) Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination); (c) Committee Against Torture (Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment); (d) Committee on the Rights of the Child (Convention on the Rights of the Child). Representation has been made by WJC representatives to both the Special Rapporteur on Torture and the Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination and Xenophobia. WJC has met with a number of United Nations officials, including the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. At these meetings, WJC representatives engaged in a dialogue to explain WJC’s areas of activity, and opportunities to assist in the work of various United Nations bodies and agencies. Throughout the period under review, WJC has been pleased to serve as Treasurer of the Conference of Non-Governmental Organizations in Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council (CONGO). WJC continues its involvement with the Special Committee of Non-Governmental Organizations on Human Rights (formerly Special Committee of International Non-Governmental Organizations on Human Rights (Geneva)) and has held the position of Treasurer for the duration of the period covered by the present quadrennial report.
