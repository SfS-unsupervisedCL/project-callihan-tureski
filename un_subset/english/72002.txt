Letter dated 25 April 2014 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to refer to the United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa in Libreville, established following an exchange of letters between the President of the Security Council and myself in 2009 and 2010 (S/2009/697 and S/2010/457) and the mandate of which was renewed and amended by an exchange of letters between the President of the Security Council and myself in 2012 (S/2012/656 and S/2012/657) and 2014 (S/2014/103 and S/2014/104). I would like to inform you of my intention to appoint Abdoulaye Bathily (Senegal) as my new Special Representative for Central Africa and Head of the United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa. He will succeed Abou Moussa (Chad), who has served as my Special Representative since May 2011. I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to Mr. Moussa for his dedication in establishing the Regional Office, as well as for his leadership and the important achievements of the Regional Office during his tenure. Mr. Bathily, who currently serves as my Deputy Special Representative for Mali, United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, brings to the position many years of political, diplomatic and academic experience with his Government, academic institutions and, most recently, the United Nations system. I am confident that he will be an asset to the Regional Office and that he will contribute greatly to efforts in the Central Africa subregion to promote peace and security. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) BAN Ki-moon
