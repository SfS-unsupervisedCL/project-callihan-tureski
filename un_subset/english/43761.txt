Sixty-second session Request for the inclusion of an additional item in the agenda of the sixty-second session Extension of the terms of the judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994 Note by the Secretary-General 1. By his letters to the General Assembly and the Security Council dated 13 June 2008, the Secretary-General requested both the Assembly and the Council to authorize the extension of the terms of the permanent and ad litem judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. 2. The current terms of the permanent and ad litem judges come to an end on 31 December 2008. The Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda does not provide for extending the terms of office of these judges. In the absence of such a provision, the approval of the Security Council, as the parent organ of the Tribunal, and of the General Assembly, as the organ that elects its judges, would be needed in order to extend the terms of office of the judges of the Trial Chambers until 31 December 2009, and of the judges of the Appeals Chambers until 31 December 2010. 3. In order for the General Assembly to consider the above-mentioned matter, the Secretary-General has the honour, pursuant to rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, to request the inclusion, in the agenda of the sixty-second session, of an additional item of an important and urgent character entitled "Extension of the term of the judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994". The Secretary-General requests that the item be considered directly in plenary meeting.
