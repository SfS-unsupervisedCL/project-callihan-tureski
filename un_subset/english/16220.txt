General Assembly, "Reaffirming its objectives, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, "Reaffirming also its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and unconditionally racism in all its forms and racial discrimination and its conviction that racism and racial discrimination constitute a total negation of the purposes and principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, "Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention against Discrimination in Education adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on 14 December 1960, "Noting the efforts of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination since its establishment in 1970 to promote the implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, "Welcoming the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance on 8 September 2001 in Durban, South Africa, "Recalling the outcome of the two World Conferences to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held at Geneva in 1978 and in 1983, "Welcoming

attained and that millions of human beings continue to the present day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination, "Noting with great concern that, despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase in many parts of the world and that the number of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters is increasing, as reflected in the report of the Special Rapporteur, "Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against, inter alia, Africans, people of African descent, Arabs, Muslims, Jews and Christians persist or are even growing in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, "Noting with grave concern that, as the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination draws to a close, most of its principal objectives have not been achieved, largely owing to lack of political will and commitment, including lack of adequate funding, "Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, marginalization and social exclusion, "Recognizing that the promotion of tolerance and respect for cultural diversity is an important factor, among others, in eliminating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, "Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications, including the Internet, continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world, "Noting that the use of such technologies can also contribute to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, "Having considered the report submitted by the Secretary-General within the framework of the implementation of the Programme of Action, "Recalling its resolution 54/154 of 17 December 1999, in which it requested the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session concrete proposals on how to ensure the financial and personnel resources required for the implementation of the Programme of Action, "Recognizing the importance of strengthening national legislation and institutions for the promotion of racial harmony and for the effective enforcement of such legislation, "Remaining firmly convinced of the need to take more effective and sustained measures at the national and international levels for the elimination of all forms of racism and racial discrimination, "Deeply concerned that the phenomenon of racism and racial discrimination against migrant workers continues to increase, despite the efforts made by the international community to improve the protection of the human rights of migrant workers and members of their families, "Recalling the adoption at its forty-fifth session of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, "Acknowledging that indigenous people are at times victims of particular forms of racism and racial discrimination, "Noting with concern the existence of multiple discrimination, in particular against women, "Stressing the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, "I "Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and

2001, and taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001/5 of 18 April 2001, "Stressing that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action provides a solid basis for combating the contemporary manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, "Stressing that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 attaches importance to the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, "Dedicating ourselves to combating the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance fully and effectively as a matter of priority, while drawing lessons from manifestations and past experiences of racism in all parts of the world with a view to avoiding their recurrence, "Joining together in a spirit of renewed political will and commitment to universal equality, justice and dignity, "Convinced that racism, as one of the exclusionist phenomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, "Having examined the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including its conclusions and recommendations, "Deeply concerned that, despite continued efforts, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and acts of violence persist and even grow in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, "Particularly alarmed at the increase in racist violence in many parts of the world, inter alia, as a result of resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, as reflected in the report of the Special Rapporteur, and at the persisting use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies, "Emphasizing that remembering the crimes and wrongs of the past, wherever and whenever they occurred, unequivocally condemning its racist tragedies and telling the truth about history are essential elements for international reconciliation and the creation of societies based on justice, equality and solidarity, "Deeply concerned that those advocating racism and racial discrimination misuse new communication technologies, including the Internet, to disseminate their repugnant views, "Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance that are increasingly visible in segments of many societies and are perpetrated by individuals or groups, some of which manifestations are directed against migrant workers and members of their families, "Reaffirming, in this regard, the responsibility of Governments for safeguarding and protecting the rights of individuals within their jurisdiction against crimes perpetrated by racist or xenophobic individuals or groups, "Recognizing both the challenges and the opportunities in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in an increasingly globalized world, "Deeply concerned that racism and racial discrimination against migrant workers continue to increase despite the efforts undertaken by the international community to protect the human rights of migrant workers and members of their families, "Noting that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its general recommendation XV (42) of 17 March 1993 concerning article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, holds that the prohibition of the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or racial hatred is compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and expression as outlined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in article 5 of the Convention, "Noting also that the reports that the States parties submit under the Convention contain, inter alia, information about the causes of, as well as measures to combat, contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, "Particularly alarmed at the rise of racist and xenophobic ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, "Noting with appreciation that the Special Rapporteur will continue to pay attention to the rise of racist and xenophobic ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, "Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, "Recognizing that failure to combat racial discrimination and xenophobia, especially by public authorities and politicians, is a factor encouraging their perpetuation in society, "Emphasizing the importance of creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance within societies, "1. Reaffirms the proclamation of 2001 as the International Year of Mobilization against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance; "2. Calls upon the relevant United Nations bodies, Member States and intergovernmental organizations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations to continue carrying out, promoting and disseminating activities and action within the framework of the commemorative year in order to strengthen its impact and ensure its success, in particular the outcome of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance; "3.

Requests the Special Rapporteur to continue his exchange of views with Member States, United Nations organs and the specialized agencies, other relevant mechanisms and non-governmental organizations in order to further their effectiveness and mutual cooperation; "5. Commends the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination for its role in the effective implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which contributes to the fight against contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; "6. Invites States to consider non-discriminatory measures to provide a safe and healthy environment for individuals and members of groups victims of or subject to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular: "(a) To improve access to public information on health and environment issues; "(b) To ensure that relevant concerns are taken into account in the public process of decision-making on the environment; "(c) To share technology and successful practices to improve human health and environment in all areas; "(d) To take appropriate remedial measures, as possible to clean, re-use and redevelop contaminated sites and, where appropriate, relocate those affected on a voluntary basis after consultations; "6bis.

Reaffirms that acts of violence against others stemming from racism do not constitute expressions of opinion but rather offences; "8bis. Calls upon States to consider the following, taking fully into account existing international and regional standards on freedom of expression, while taking all necessary measures to guarantee the right to freedom of opinion and expression: "(a) To encourage Internet service providers to establish and disseminate specific voluntary codes of conduct and self-regulatory measures against the dissemination of racist messages and those that result in racial discrimination, xenophobia or any form of intolerance and discrimination; to that end, Internet providers are encouraged to set up mediating bodies at national and international levels, involving relevant civil society institutions; "(b) To adopt and apply, to the extent possible, appropriate legislation for prosecuting those responsible for incitement to racial hatred or violence on the new information and communications technologies, including the Internet; "(c) To address the problem of dissemination of racist material through the new information and communications technologies, including the Internet, inter alia by imparting training to law enforcement authorities; "(d) To denounce and actively discourage the transmission of racist and xenophobic messages through all communications media, including new information and communications technologies, such as the Internet; "(e) To consider a prompt and coordinated international response to the rapidly evolving phenomenon of the dissemination of hate speech and racist material on new information and communications technologies, including the Internet; and in this context to strengthen international cooperation; "(f) To encourage access and use by all people of the Internet as an international and equal forum, aware that there are disparities in use of and access to the Internet; "(g) To examine ways in which the positive contribution made by the new information and communications technologies, such as the Internet, can be enhanced through replication of good practices in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; "(h) To encourage the reflection of the diversity of societies among the personnel of media organizations and the new information and communications technologies, such as the Internet, by promoting adequate representation of different segments within societies at all levels of their organizational structure; "9. Declares that racism and racial discrimination are among the most serious violations of human rights in the contemporary world and must be combated by all available means; "9bis.

Also expresses its profound concern about and unequivocal condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination, including propaganda, activities and organizations based on doctrines of superiority of one race or group of persons that attempt to justify or promote racism and racial discrimination in any form; "11bis. Expresses its concern that, beyond the fact that racism is gaining ground, contemporary forms and manifestations of racism and xenophobia are striving to regain political, moral and even legal recognition in many ways, including through the platforms of some political parties and organizations and the dissemination through modern communication technologies of ideas based on the notion of racial superiority; "11ter. Notes that article 4 (b) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination places an obligation upon States to be vigilant and to proceed against organizations that disseminate ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, acts of violence or incitement to such acts; those organizations shall be condemned and discouraged; "12.

Notes with great concern that, despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related forms of intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase in many parts of the world, and that the number of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic charters is increasing, as reflected in the report of the Special Rapporteur; "13bis.

Encourages Governments to take appropriate measures to eradicate all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; "16bis. Underscores the need to design, promote and implement at the national, regional and international levels strategies, programmes and policies, and adequate legislation, which may include special and positive measures, for furthering equal social development and the realization of the civil and political, economic, social and cultural rights of all victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including through more effective access to the political, judicial and administrative institutions, as well as to guarantee that the benefits of development, science and technology contribute effectively to the improvement of the quality of life for all, without discrimination; "16ter.

Xenophobia and Related Intolerance addressed a wide range of practical issues, including measures to combat contemporary manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Stressing that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 attaches importance to the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, Reaffirming the spirit of renewed political will and commitment to combat the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, from which no country is free, Convinced that racism, as one of the exclusionist phenomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Deeply concerned that, despite continued efforts, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and acts of violence persist and even grow in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, Particularly alarmed at the increase in racist violence in many parts of the world, inter alia, as a result of the resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies, Emphasizing that remembering the crimes and wrongs of the past, wherever and whenever they occurred, unequivocally condemning its racist tragedies and telling the truth about history are essential elements for international reconciliation and the creation of societies based on justice, equality and solidarity, Deeply concerned that those advocating racism and racial discrimination misuse new communication technologies, including the Internet, to disseminate their repugnant views, Noting that the use of such technologies can also contribute to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance that are increasingly visible in segments of many societies and are perpetrated by individuals or groups, some of which manifestations are directed against migrant workers and members of

Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, holds that the prohibition of the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or racial hatred is compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and expression as outlined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in article 5 of the Convention, Affirming that universal adherence to and full implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination are of paramount importance for promoting equality and non-discrimination in the world, Noting

law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Recognizing that failure to combat racial discrimination and xenophobia, especially by public authorities and politicians, is a factor encouraging their perpetuation in society, Emphasizing the importance of creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance within societies, 1.
