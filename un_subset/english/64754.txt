respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and programmes to fight extreme poverty, Recognizing that

Emphasizes that poverty eradication policies should tackle poverty by addressing its root and structural causes and manifestations, and that equity and the reduction of inequalities need to be incorporated into those policies; 9. Stresses that poverty eradication policies should, inter alia, ensure, for people living in poverty, access to education, health, social protection, water and sanitation and other public and social services, as well as to productive resources, including credit, land, training, technology, knowledge and information, and ensure that citizens and local communities participate in decision-making on social development policies and programmes in this regard; 10.

Notes with concern the continuing high levels of unemployment and underemployment, particularly among young people, recognizes that decent work remains one of the best routes out of poverty, and in this regard invites donor countries, multilateral organizations and other development partners to continue to support Member States, in particular developing countries, in their efforts to promote full and productive employment and decent work for all, taking into account the resolution entitled "Recovering from the crisis: a Global Jobs Pact", adopted on 19 June 2009 by the International Labour Conference at its ninety-eighth session; 17.

Recalls the commitment, undertaken at the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, held in 2010, to redouble efforts to reduce maternal and child mortality and improve the health of women and children, including through strengthened national health systems, efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, improved nutrition and access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation, making use of enhanced global partnerships; 20. Notes with grave concern the vicious cycle whereby non-communicable diseases and their risk factors worsen poverty, while poverty contributes to rising rates of non-communicable diseases, posing a threat to public health and economic and social development, and in this regard stresses the importance of the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, including through multisectoral actions, and encourages the continued inclusion of non-communicable diseases in development cooperation agendas and initiatives; 21. Stresses that the benefits of economic growth should be distributed more equitably, and in that regard calls upon States to promote more equitable participation in and access to economic growth gains through, inter alia, policies that ensure inclusive labour markets and by implementing socially responsive macroeconomic policies in which employment has a key role and social inclusion strategies that promote social integration, including through social protection floors, including for those who are in vulnerable or marginalized situations; 22.

Calls upon Member States to continue their ambitious efforts to strive for more inclusive, equitable, balanced, stable and development-oriented sustainable socioeconomic approaches to overcoming poverty and inequality; 27.
