Sixty-fifth session Agenda item 129 Programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 Estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions I. Introduction 1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on estimates in respect of special political missions, good offices and other political initiatives authorized by the General Assembly and/or the Security Council (A/65/328/Add.7). The report contains the proposed resource requirements for two special political missions, namely the Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for the period from 1 April to 31 December 2011 and the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions for the period from 1 May to 31 December 2011 in the amount of $3,595,800 net ($3,747,500 gross). During its consideration of the proposal, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification. 2. The Secretary-General's proposals regarding the Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions are contained in paragraph 23 of his report (A/65/328/Add.7). The comments of the Advisory Committee relating to the requirements for the two special political missions are set out below. II. Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 3. By its resolution 1973 (2011), the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to create, for an initial period of one year, in consultation with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011), a group of up to eight experts, under the direction of the Committee. The tasks of the Panel of Experts are contained in paragraph 24 of Council resolution 1973 (2011) (see also A/65/328/Add.7, para. 1). The Secretary-General states that the Panel will carry out its mandated activities, in particular, by monitoring the implementation of the relevant measures specified in resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011). The Secretary-General further states that, if feasible and subject to the security situation, the Panel is expected to conduct extensive fieldwork and carry out on-site investigation of reported violations. 4. The Secretary-General indicates that the Panel would be "home-based" and would be supported by a Political Affairs Officer (P-3), who would provide analysis, assist in the preparation of reports and organize and administer the electronic database in support of the Panel's operations, and a Research Assistant (General Service (Other level)). Both these staff would be based in New York (A/65/328/Add.7, para. 4). 5. The requirements for the Panel for the period from 1 April to 31 December 2011 are estimated in the report of the Secretary-General to amount to $2,126,800 net ($2,156,900 gross). These resources would provide for the costs of the two general temporary assistance-funded positions (1 P-3 and 1 General Service (Other level)) ($179,200), fees ($763,500) and travel ($915,600) of the eight experts of the Panel, official travel of United Nations staff ($138,300) and other operational and logistical support requirements ($130,200) (ibid., para. 7). 6. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the Secretary-General had authorized commitments of up to $2,235,500 for the Panel of Experts under unforeseen and extraordinary expenses based on preliminary estimates for the period from 1 April to 31 December 2011. The Committee was also informed, however, that no expenditures had been incurred to date. It was further stated that although the Panel had been expected to be operational in April 2011, it was now envisaged that the seven experts appointed to date would report for duty on 1 June 2011, while the eighth was still under recruitment. In this regard, the Committee was informed that the estimated requirements for the seven-month period from 1 June 2011 to 31 December 2011 amount to $1,670,400 net ($1,693,500 gross). The breakdown of the revised requirements is outlined in the table below. (Thousands of United States dollars) Requirements for 2011 Total requirements Net requirements Non-recurrent requirements Category of expenditure I. Civilian personnel costs 1. International staff Total category I II. Operational costs 1. Consultants and experts 2. Official travel 3. Facilities and infrastructure 4. Ground transportation 5. Communications 6. Information technology 7. Other supplies, services and equipment Total category II Total net requirements 7. The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the two positions (1 P-3 and 1 General Service (Other level)) requested to support the work of the Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The Committee also recommends approval of the revised operational cost requirements for the Panel of Experts for the period from 1 June to 31 December 2011, as outlined in the table above. III. United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions 8. In its resolution 1866 (2009), the Security Council took note of the discussions that commenced in Geneva on 15 October 2008 on security and stability and the return of internally displaced persons and refugees and requested the Secretary-General, through his Special Representative, to continue to fully support the process. 9. Further to the "Proposals for joint incident prevention and response mechanisms" agreed to in Geneva in February 2009, the Secretary-General addressed a letter to the President of the Security Council on 28 September 2009 in which he updated the Council on the progress of the Geneva international discussions and the convening of the Joint Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism (IPRM) under the United Nations auspices in Gali. The Secretary-General further stated that following consultations with stakeholders, the United Nations would continue to support the discussions and IPRM through a limited number of personnel. He stated that these personnel would be based in Geneva but would spend as much time as required on the ground (see A/65/328/Add.7, para. 10). 10. The Secretary-General indicates that the Geneva international discussions and IPRM are expected to convene regularly, requiring United Nations substantive and technical support. It is stated that the discussions are expected to convene on average once every two or two and a half months, and that the United Nations Representative would take part in preparatory visits prior to those meetings. IPRM is expected to meet once every three weeks on average. The Secretary-General also states that international staff are required to support the United Nations Representative, liaise with all relevant actors and manage the day-to-day activities related to IPRM (ibid., para. 18). 11. Resource requirements for the period from 1 May to 31 December 2011 are estimated by the Secretary-General at $1,469,000 net ($1,590,600 gross). This would provide for the establishment of seven positions ($958,000), travel of staff ($343,400), facilities and infrastructure ($67,200), ground transportation ($7,700), communications and information technology ($32,600) and other services, supplies and equipment ($59,200). 12. As outlined in paragraph 22 of the report of the Secretary-General, it is proposed that the Office of the United Nations Representative comprise seven positions as follows: (a) United Nations Representative (Assistant Secretary-General); (b) Political Affairs Officers (2 P-4 and 1 P-3); (c) Police Advisers (P-4 and P-3); (d) Administrative Assistant (General Service (Other level)). 13. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the United Nations support for the Geneva discussions had been financed under unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for the period from 1 November 2009 through 30 April 2011, with a total of $2,713,700 being authorized for that purpose. 14. The Advisory Committee was further informed that presently, two of the seven positions, a Political Affairs Officer (P-4) and the Police Adviser (P-3), were vacant. While noting that no vacancy factor had been applied to the proposed resource requirements, the Committee was informed that it was anticipated that both positions would be filled in the near future. 15. The Advisory Committee recommends acceptance of the seven positions for the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions and the related operational costs as proposed by the Secretary-General. IV. Observations and recommendations 16. As indicated above, the Advisory Committee notes that for both proposed special political missions, the Secretary-General had initially authorized commitments under unforeseen and extraordinary expenses. The Committee was further informed that to continue to fund them through that mechanism until the end of the biennium would reduce the capacity of the Secretary-General to respond to critical and urgent peace and security and good offices issues that may arise during the remainder of 2011. 17. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that commitments to date in 2011 under unforeseen and extraordinary expenses totalled $2,869,800, excluding commitments authorized for the Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions for the periods for which resources are now proposed in the report of the Secretary-General. The Committee notes that if this mechanism had been used to fund the Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, a new activity, through the end of the biennium, approximately $3.5 million would have remained available to the Secretary-General for unforeseen and extraordinary expenses without requiring its prior concurrence. The Committee questions why the Secretary-General did not exercise this authority, particularly given that, under General Assembly resolution 64/246, he has recourse to additional commitments, with the prior concurrence of the Committee, should the $8 million authorized be exhausted. 18. With regard to the Secretary-General's proposals for action to be taken by the General Assembly, as set out in paragraph 23 of his report (A/65/328/Add.7), the Advisory Committee recommends as follows: (a) Taking into account the revised estimates provided by the Secretary-General, as detailed in paragraph 6 above, that the General Assembly approve the budget for the Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for the period from 1 June to 31 December 2011 in the amount of $1,670,400 net ($1,693,500 gross); (b) That the General Assembly approve the budget of the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions for the period from 1 May to 31 December 2011 in the amount of $1,469,000 net ($1,590,600 gross); (c) That the resources for the activities of the Panel of Experts on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the United Nations Representative to the Geneva International Discussions be absorbed within the overall appropriation approved for special political missions for the 2010-2011 biennium and to report thereon in the context of the second performance report.
