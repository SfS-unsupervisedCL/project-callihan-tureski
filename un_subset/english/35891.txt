Through a continuous dialogue, the status quo in the functioning of the Organization will continue to be challenged, client priorities identified and management policies developed or improved to ensure that the work of the Organization is conducted in a more efficient, effective and transparent manner. 24.4 The Department of Management will aim to ensure that all new or revised management policies, procedures and internal controls meet or exceed international "best practice" standards. The capacity of managers to deliver mandated programmes will be strengthened through improved management training, more focused programme planning, as well as regular and systematic monitoring and evaluation practices. The Department will also closely monitor oversight body recommendations, identify material weaknesses and ensure that remediation plans are developed. 24.5 Taking into account the decisions of the General Assembly on investing in information technology, the Department will ensure a global information and communication technology system is in place to support the full range of management functions and to promote transparency by enabling managers to incorporate programme objectives, knowledge assets and budgetary and financial data into one integrated technology-assisted process. Such a system will play a critical role in the implementation of International Public Sector Accounting Standards, once adopted by the Assembly. 24.6 Human resources management reform will continue to reflect the multicultural environment of the Organization and will be implemented to empower staff, increase their flexibility and mobility in adapting to the priorities of the Organization and enhance their ability to carry out their work more effectively.
