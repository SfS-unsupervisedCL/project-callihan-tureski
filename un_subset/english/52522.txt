Sixty-fourth session Agenda item 112 (j) Appointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and other appointments: appointment of the three ad litem judges of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal Report of the Internal Justice Council I. Introduction 1. By its resolution 63/253, the General Assembly decided that three ad litem judges should be appointed to the United Nations Dispute Tribunal for a period of one year with effect from 1 July 2009. 2. In its decision 64/418 of 29 March 2010, the General Assembly decided to extend the tenure of the three ad litem judges, namely, Michael Adams, Jean-François Cousin and Nkemdilim Amelia Izuako, for one additional year beginning on 1 July 2010. 3. On 5 April 2010, Judge Michael Adams informed the President of the General Assembly that, for personal reasons, he would be unable to accept the extension of his appointment as ad litem judge of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal in New York. Accordingly, the Internal Justice Council, mandated by General Assembly resolution 62/228 (para. 37) to provide its views and recommendations to the General Assembly on two or three candidates for each judicial vacancy, met to consider how best to identify appropriate candidates for the position of ad litem judge in New York. 4. Due to the urgent need to appoint an ad litem judge to begin work on 1 July 2010, the Internal Justice Council determined that it would first consider those persons put forward in its report to the General Assembly for appointment as a judge on the United Nations Dispute Tribunal or United Nations Appeals Tribunal (A/63/489). All persons put forward but not ultimately selected, excepting those from countries currently represented on the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, were contacted by the Internal Justice Council to determine whether they would be willing to be considered as candidates for appointment as ad litem judge. 5. The Council herewith presents the names of two candidates for appointment as ad litem judge. The candidates are the only two from the list previously submitted to the General Assembly who are not from countries currently represented on the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and who are available for appointment as ad litem judge for one year from 1 July 2010. The two candidates were subjected to an examination and interview process in September 2008 and recommended for appointment as judges of the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, as described in the report of the Council (A/63/489). 6. The Council considers that, given the exigent circumstances and the need for the General Assembly to appoint the ad litem judge prior to 1 July 2010, it would not be desirable to delay the process by advertising for additional suitable candidates for the position. Accordingly, the Council based its recommendations for the position of ad litem judge on the candidates already identified in its report. Should the General Assembly require additional candidates to be identified, the Council will take the necessary steps to do so. II. Profiles of recommended candidates 7. The two candidates recommended by the Council for appointment to the position of ad litem judge are listed alphabetically by last name.
