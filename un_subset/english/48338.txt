General Assembly Security Council Sixty-third session Sixty-fourth year Agenda item 10 Report of the Peacebuilding Commission Letter dated 6 January 2009 from the President of the Security Council to the Secretary-General I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1646 (2005), adopted on 20 December 2005, in which the Council, in keeping with its resolution 1645 (2005), adopted on the same date, decided that the permanent members listed in Article 23, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations should be members of the Organizational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission and that, in addition, the Council should annually select two of its elected members to participate in the Organizational Committee. I therefore have the honour to inform you that, following informal consultations on 6 January 2009, the members of the Security Council agreed on the selection of Burkina Faso and Mexico as the two elected members of the Council to participate in the Organizational Committee for a term of one year, until the end of 2009.
