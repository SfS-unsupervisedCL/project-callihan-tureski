Fourth session Vienna, 8-17 October 2008 Items 3 and 5 of the provisional agenda* * CTOC/COP/2008/1. Technical assistance Financial and budgetary matters Note by the Secretariat I. Introduction Pursuant to article 30, paragraph 2 (c), of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, States parties to the Convention shall make concrete efforts to provide technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition to assist them in meeting their needs for the implementation of the Convention and, to that end, to endeavour to make adequate and regular voluntary contributions to an account specifically designated for that purpose in a United Nations funding mechanism. By its resolution 55/25 of 15 November 2000 the General Assembly adopted the Convention and decided that, until the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime decided otherwise, that account would be operated within the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund for the provision to developing countries and countries with economies in transition of the technical assistance that they might require for implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto, including for the preparatory measures needed for that implementation. In order to comply with General Assembly resolution 55/25, an account was opened within the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund for the provision of the above-mentioned activities. In its decision 2/6, the Conference decided to establish an open-ended interim working group to advise and assist it in the implementation of its mandate on technical assistance. The Open-ended Interim Working Group of Government Experts on Technical Assistance met during the third session of the Conference, on which occasion it identified priority areas and adopted recommendations for technical assistance activities. Those recommendations were endorsed by the Conference in its decision 3/4. The Working Group met again in Vienna from 3 to 5 October 2007. On the basis of the identified priority areas, the Conference set out a number of proposals for technical assistance activities (see the working paper prepared by the Secretariat CTOC/COP/2008/16). Once endorsed by the Conference, those proposals could be implemented during the period 2009-2011. The present note describes the budgetary requirements for the proposed technical assistance activities. To date, contributions for the technical assistance activities required to implement the Convention and the Protocols thereto have been made to various accounts and projects, not solely to the account opened within the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund for the provision of the above-mentioned activities. Recalling article 30 of the Convention and General Assembly resolution 55/25, the Secretariat invites Member States to contribute directly to the account specifically created to assist in the implementation of the Convention, with a view to enhancing transparency and reporting. Information on the current status of the account is given in the annex to the present note. II.

F. Ensuring the provision of integrated legal assistance In addition to the budgetary requirements presented above, broken down by priority area and specific activities, the overarching funding needed by UNODC to provide integrated legal assistance must be taken into account. Although the specifics of a programme for providing legal assistance activities, currently being designed by UNODC, are not available yet, sufficient funds to support such an endeavour will be essential to ensure the provision of coherent technical assistance during the period 2009-2011. Essentially, it is proposed that an adequate number of legal experts capable of holistically addressing various aspects of the legal mandate of UNODC and of substantively coordinating various assistance activities arising from those legal mandates be well integrated into the field office network of UNODC. A stronger presence of decentralized experts would enable UNODC to respond to requests for integrated technical assistance, including those outlined in the working paper prepared by the Secretariat (CTOC/COP/2008/16, paras. 36 and 49). At present, it is estimated that $5 million will be required by the above-mentioned legal assistance programme during the first two years of its implementation. Further, it is expected that that amount will be split equally into the two priority areas of strengthening criminal justice responses to organized crime based on the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto and international cooperation and establishment or strengthening of central authorities for mutual legal assistance and extradition, as these are the main areas that the programme will focus on, as reflected in the table below. III. Summary The total estimated budget required to undertake the activities described in the working paper prepared by the Secretariat (CTOC/COP/2008/16) amounts to $10,590,900. A breakdown, by priority area, of the total estimated budgetary requirements is set out in the table below.
