Letter dated 30 December 2005 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1132 (1997) concerning Sierra Leone addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to transmit herewith the report of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1132 (1997) concerning Sierra Leone containing an account of the Committee's activities for 2005 (see annex). The report is being submitted in accordance with the note by the President of the Security Council dated 29 March 1995 (S/1995/234). (Signed) Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg Chairman Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1132 (1997) concerning Sierra Leone Annex Report of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1132 (1997) concerning Sierra Leone I. Introduction 1. The present report of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1132 (1997) concerning Sierra Leone covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2005. 2. A report of the Committee covering its activities from 1 January to 31 December 2004 was submitted to the Security Council on 25 January 2005 (S/2005/44). 3. For 2005, the Bureau consisted of Ambassador Ronaldo Mota Sardenberg (Brazil) as Chairman, with the delegations of Algeria and Argentina providing the Vice-Chairmen (see S/2005/3). 4. The Committee did not meet during the reporting period. However, the members were able to take all necessary decisions through the no-objection procedure. II. Background information and summary of the work of the Committee A. Background information 5. By its resolution 1132 (1997) of 8 October 1997, the Security Council, determining that the situation in Sierra Leone, following the military coup of 25 May 1997, constituted a threat to international peace and security in the region, imposed a mandatory ban on the sale or supply by States to Sierra Leone of arms and related materiel as well as petroleum and petroleum products. The Security Council, by paragraph 5 of the resolution, also imposed travel restrictions on members of the military junta and adult members of their families. Subsequently, by its resolution 1156 (1998) of 15 March 1998, the Council lifted the oil embargo and, by its resolution 1171 (1998) of 5 June 1998, confirmed the removal of sanctions on the Government and reimposed the embargo on the sale or supply of arms to Sierra Leone other than to the Government, as well as the travel ban on leading members of the Revolutionary United Front and of the former military junta. 6. On 5 July 2000, the Security Council adopted resolution 1306 (2000), in which it decided, inter alia, that all States should, for an initial period of 18 months, prohibit the direct or indirect import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to their territory. In the same resolution, the Council also decided that diamonds controlled by the Government of Sierra Leone through the certificate of origin regime would be exempt from those measures. 7. The Council's prohibitions on the import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone not controlled by the certificate of origin regime were extended for an additional period of 11 months by its resolution 1385 (2001), and for another period of 6 months by its resolution 1446 (2002). 8. On 5 June 2003, the President of the Security Council read out a statement to the press (SC/7778) in which he noted, inter alia, that in the light of the increased efforts of the Government of Sierra Leone to control and manage its diamond industry and ensure proper control over diamond-mining areas and its full participation in the Kimberley Process, members of the Council had agreed not to renew the prohibition against the import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone not controlled by the certificate of origin regime. 9. With the expiration of the Council's measures concerning diamonds from Sierra Leone, the mandate of the Committee is once again wholly contained in paragraph 6 of resolution 1171 (1998), which stipulates that the Committee should undertake the tasks referred to in paragraph 10 (a), (b), (c), (d), (f) and (h) of resolution 1132 (1997) in connection with the arms embargo on non-State actors and the travel ban imposed by resolution 1171 (1998), both of which are still in force. 10. As at the date of the present report, the travel ban list includes the names of 30 individuals designated as leading members of the former military junta in Sierra Leone, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), or as leading members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The travel ban list was last revised on 20 September 2004, when 16 names were removed on the basis of information provided by the Government of Sierra Leone. In a letter dated 30 September 2004, the Chairman informed the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone that the Committee would welcome any further information or recommendations from the Government in connection with the travel ban list or the individuals whose names are inscribed therein. However, in the course of 2005 no further information was received from the Government of Sierra Leone. B. Summary of the activities of the Committee 11. The Committee received a letter dated 2 August 2005 from the Charg√© d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations informing the Committee of the proposed export of a diesel electric generator from Greece to Sierra Leone by a South African power company. In a reply dated 11 August 2005, the Chairman conveyed the view of the members of the Committee that such equipment did not constitute arms or related materiel as referred to in paragraph 4 of resolution 1171 (1998) and was therefore not subject to the Committee's consideration. 12. In a letter dated 22 August 2005, the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified the Committee of the export of blank ammunition and demolition stores to Sierra Leone, in accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 1171 (1998). In accordance with the same paragraph, the Chairman informed the President of the Security Council about the notification received from the United Kingdom in a letter dated 29 August 2005 (S/2005/561). 13. In a letter dated 3 November 2005, the Permanent Mission of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified the Committee of its intention to grant a licence to a United Kingdom company for the export of armoured cars for use by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, in accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 1171 (1998). In accordance with the same paragraph, the Chairman informed the President of the Security Council about the notification received from the United Kingdom in a letter dated 10 November 2005 (S/2005/724). C. Violations and alleged violations of the sanctions regime 14. During the reporting period, no violations or alleged violations of the sanctions regime were brought to the attention of the Committee. III. Observations 15. In his twenty-seventh report on the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) (S/2005/777), the Secretary-General noted that the overall security situation in the country had remained stable, and that the national security agencies had continued to acquit themselves satisfactorily since UNAMSIL transferred security primacy to them in 2004. 16. During his two-year term, the Chairman has consulted with members of the Committee on the appropriate time to streamline the legal basis for sanctions in Sierra Leone, while avoiding any disturbance to stability and safeguarding the work of the Special Court. 17. It is the view of the Chairman that following the completion of the drawdown of UNAMSIL the time will be ripe for the Security Council to revisit the legal basis of its measures concerning Sierra Leone. In that regard, he trusts that consultations within the Committee and with the Government of Sierra Leone, as well as with the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone, soon to be implemented in accordance with resolution 1620 (2005), will be of use to the Security Council.
