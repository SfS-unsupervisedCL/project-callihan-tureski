The Geosciences Directorate of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) has been working on the IBGE Geographical Names Programme since late 2004. Since then, a multidisciplinary team based in the Cartography Department has been focusing on research, proposals and project implementation, pooling efforts to provide Brazil with the necessary infrastructure for geographical names and strengthening citizen participation in this area in response to the challenges of globalization. Recently, IBGE has launched other similar initiatives, including projects supported by the Pan-American Institute of Geography and History (PAIGH) and cooperation with national and international institutions which use geographical names in some way and are interested in participating in national and international standardization efforts as a way of reducing costs and improving the quality of the information that is produced and disseminated.
