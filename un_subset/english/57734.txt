It provided for 860 military contingent personnel, 69 United Nations police officers, 40 international staff (including 1 temporary position), 113 national staff and 1 United Nations Volunteer. 2. In paragraph 35 of its related report of 25 March 2010 (A/64/660/Add.5), the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions recommended that the General Assembly appropriate the amount of $56,894,600 gross for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. 3. The General Assembly, by its resolution 64/274, appropriated the amount of $56,325,700 gross ($53,770,000 net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. The appropriated amount included voluntary contributions from the Government of Cyprus, in the amount of $18,954,592, equivalent to one third of the net appropriation, and $6.5 million from the Government of Greece. The amount of $34,304,608 gross ($31,466,108 net) has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance A. Overall 4. The mandate of UNFICYP was established by the Security Council in its resolution 186 (1964) and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions. The mandate for the reporting period was provided by the Council in its resolutions 1930 (2010), 1953 (2010) and 1986 (2011). 5. The Force is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to ensure peace and security in Cyprus and the return to normal conditions. 6. Within this overall objective, UNFICYP has contributed to a number of accomplishments during the reporting period by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below, which are grouped by political and civil affairs, military, United Nations police and support components. 7. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based-budgeting frameworks set out in the 2010/11 budget. In particular, the report compares the actual indicators of achievement, that is, the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement, and the actual completed outputs with the planned outputs. B. Budget implementation 8. In fulfilling its mandate, UNFICYP continued to apply an integrated approach in carrying out its tasks, which was based on close cooperation between the civil affairs, military and police components of the Force. Efforts were focused on maintaining the stability of the buffer zone, in particular on managing civilian activities, which continued to intensify. To that end, coordination arrangements were implemented with the relevant authorities to address unauthorized construction activities in the buffer zone. 9. In addition to fulfilling its peacekeeping mandate, UNFICYP provided substantive, administrative and logistical support to the political process. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Chief of Mission of UNFICYP, in her capacity as the Deputy Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus, coordinated the provision of assistance by the Force to the Secretary-General's good offices mission. The Chief of Mission chaired meetings between the two Cypriot leaders and their representatives in the absence of the Special Adviser from the island. Staff of UNFICYP continued to act as facilitators of meetings at the level of working groups and technical committees to discuss substantive and day-to-day issues affecting both communities. 10. As in the previous period, UNFICYP utilized regularly scheduled commercial flights for the rotation of military contingent personnel, which had proven to be more cost-effective than charter flights. C. Mission support initiatives 11. During the reporting period, UNFICYP implemented various service improvements in the areas of asset management, facilities and infrastructure, ground transportation, personnel and communications and information technology. A reduction in the percentage of the value of spare parts holdings to the total value of information technology assets from 5 per cent to 1 per cent was achieved as a result of the implementation of regional communications and information technology services and the acquisition of spare parts through the use of just-in-time contracts. The duration of the selection process for national staff decreased from 94 days to 74 days. In addition, there was an increase in the frequency of the provision of reports on the movement of assets to concerned organizational units from a quarterly basis to a monthly basis and a decrease in the interval related to the identification and recording of "assets not found" on the Galileo asset management system from a maximum of nine months to a maximum of three months. However, the target of reducing the number of traffic accidents/incidents involving UNFICYP vehicles was not achieved as the actual number was slightly higher than expected (actual 5 per cent compared to the planned 4 per cent). D. Regional mission cooperation 12. UNFICYP continued its cooperation with the United Nations entities in the region, including the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). The Force also continued to exchange technical expertise in the field of communications and information technology and sharing the communications hub at Camp Ziouani with UNDOF, UNIFIL and UNTSO. In addition, the Regional Conduct and Discipline Team and the Regional Oversight Office, which are based in UNIFIL, provided their full support to UNFICYP. 13. UNFICYP continued its close cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union in the framework of demining and other activities, including bicommunal and humanitarian activities, civil society group events and joint infrastructure projects on the island. In addition, UNFICYP continued to provide support to the Committee on Missing Persons. 14. The Force is the focal point for administrative place of assignment in respect of international staff and their dependants serving United Nations entities in Yemen. Furthermore, UNFICYP is the designated primary "safe haven" for staff and dependants of United Nations peacekeeping missions, agencies, funds and programmes in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Gaza. In this connection, on 3 February 2011, UNFICYP was involved in the evacuation and relocation of 325 United Nations staff and their dependants from Egypt to Cyprus. E. Results-based-budgeting frameworks Component 1: political and civil affairs 15. Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1898 (2009), the activities of the Force focused on creating conditions conducive to the ongoing political negotiations for a Cyprus settlement. In this regard, the Force continued to facilitate the resolution of conflicts in various fields between the two communities, promoted the increase of mutual dialogue and cooperation through bicommunal activities and supported the opening of an additional crossing point and other confidence-building measures, such as demining and military "de-confrontation". While UNFICYP strived to achieve progress towards normal living conditions in the buffer zone, it continued to take effective measures against unauthorized use of the area and to provide humanitarian assistance to members of both communities, as and when required. In addition, the Force assisted the good offices efforts through the Special Representative of the Secretary-General/Chief of Mission, as the principal adviser and deputy to the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on Cyprus, focusing on the full-fledged negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders. Furthermore, UNFICYP provided substantive and logistical assistance to the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General, including the facilitation of meetings of the technical committees, working groups and other expert groups, which continued to hold bicommunal discussions on matters of common concern and core issues that affect both communities. To that end, the Force continued to designate political and civil affairs staff to act as facilitators and to extend the assistance of its public information personnel. In addition, UNFICYP also participated in contingency planning in relation to the settlement of the Cyprus issue, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1898 (2009).

In accordance with the mandate of UNFICYP, the military component focused its activities on the development and delivery of the operational capabilities and requirements needed to support and enhance its mandate of ensuring continued stability, thus creating the conditions necessary for meaningful and lasting political discussions to take place. In conjunction with the other components, the military component continued to carry out its tasks related to the maintenance of the ceasefire and the integrity of the United Nations buffer zone through the mobile-patrolling concept, the provision of support on confidence-building measures, the reduction in tension between the opposing forces and the equitable application of the rules governing access to and use of the buffer zone. In addition, the military component supported, wherever feasible, the good offices mission of the Secretary-General and other United Nations entities involved in the peace process. Expected accomplishment 2.1: Maintenance of the ceasefire and the integrity of the United Nations buffer zone Reduction in the number of ceasefire violations (2008/09: 778; 2009/10: 946; 2010/11: 720) Achieved;

In line with the mandate of the Force, the police component continued to enhance the development of policing strategies that promoted trust between the two communities within the UNFICYP framework on the civilian use of the buffer zone. In support of this endeavour, the police component strengthened their support to the other components by enhancing their patrol capabilities through strategies based on contemporary policing methodologies. The Force continued to build on its existing relationships with police authorities from both sides, various entities dealing with environmental issues, game wardens from Cyprus and representatives of nongovernmental organizations from both sides to develop anti-crime strategies and, where necessary, facilitate the investigation of crimes committed in the buffer zone. United Nations police continued to explore ways to promote cooperation between police authorities from both sides regarding the criminal activities that affect the two communities.

Financial resources Military observers Formed police units Subtotal United Nations Volunteers General temporary assistance Government-provided personnel Civilian electoral observers Consultants Official travel Naval transportation Special equipment Other supplies, services and equipment Quick-impact projects Voluntary contributions in kind (budgeted)a a Includes $1,562,100 from the Government of Cyprus for maintenance/repair services, maintenance supplies for UNFICYP facilities and rations for United Nations police. B. Summary information on redeployments across groups (Thousands of United States dollars) Appropriation Group Original distribution Redeployment Revised I. Military and police personnel II. Civilian personnel III. Operational costs Total Percentage of redeployment to total appropriation 19. The redeployment of funds was primarily attributable to additional requirements for international staff, higher common staff costs for national staff under civilian personnel, increased requirements under operational costs resulting from higher costs for the rental of vehicles, higher fuel costs and higher costs for utilities and maintenance services. Reduced requirements under military and police personnel resulted from lower costs for the rotation of contingent personnel through commercial flights and the lower unit cost of rations. C. Monthly expenditure pattern 20. Higher expenditures in July and September 2010 and in April and June 2011 were attributable to obligations raised for reimbursements to troop-contributing Governments for standard troop costs, contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment. D. Other income and adjustments Interest income Other/miscellaneous income Cancellation of prior-period obligations E. Expenditure for contingent-owned equipment: major equipment and self-sustainment Major equipment Self-sustainment Mission factors Effective date Last review A. Applicable to Mission area B. Applicable to home country Incremental transportation factor F. Value of non-budgeted contributions Actual value Status-of-forces agreementa Voluntary contributions in kind (non-budgeted) a Inclusive of market value, as estimated by UNFICYP, of the cost of United Nations observation posts, office and accommodation facilities provided by the Government of Cyprus to the Force for military contingents and United Nations police. IV. Analysis of variances 21. The unutilized balance was attributable primarily to: (a) lower actual costs of commercial and charter flights for the rotation of contingent personnel; (b) lower actual unit cost for rations ($7.58 per person-day) than the budgeted cost ($8.51 per person-day); and (c) reduced requirements for mission subsistence allowances resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the United States dollar (average rate of Euro0.741 per United States dollar against the budgeted rate of Euro0.700 per United States dollar). The variance was offset in part by additional requirements for standard troop cost reimbursements as a result of the lower actual vacancy rate of 0.5 per cent compared with the delayed deployment factor of 1 per cent applied in the budget. 22. The unutilized balance was primarily attributable to reduced requirements for mission subsistence allowances and for the rotation travel of police officers owing to the higher vacancy rate of 4 per cent, compared with the delayed deployment of 1 per cent applied in the budget and the above-mentioned fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the United States dollar. 23. The unutilized balance was primarily attributable to reduced requirements for national staff salaries, owing to the above-mentioned fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the United States dollar. 24. The additional requirements were attributable to higher actual requirements for the employment of temporary personnel (individual contractors) as replacements for staff on maternity or extended sick leave. 25. The unspent balance was primarily attributable to the cancellation of some planned non-training travel related to annual conferences and workshops owing to cost-saving measures. 26. The additional requirements were primarily attributable to: (a) higher actual costs for electricity at an average cost of $176,600 per month compared to the budgeted cost of $156,700 per month; (b) higher actual monthly cost of $279,700 compared to the budgeted cost of $205,300 for the new contract for consolidated camp services effective 1 March 2011; and (c) higher actual consumption of kerosene (223,800 litres) compared to the budgeted estimate (190,000 litres) and the higher unit cost of kerosene at $0.93 per litre compared to the budgeted $0.48 per litre. The variance was partly offset by reduced requirements for alteration and renovation services owing to the Force's reduced share of the renovation costs of sites in the United Nations Protected Area in which water and electrical distribution systems are located. 27. The additional requirements were attributable to higher costs for the rental of vehicles in connection with the renewal of the rental contract and higher unit costs for petrol (actual cost of $0.87 per litre compared to $0.61 per litre budgeted) and diesel fuel (actual cost of $0.91 per litre compared to $0.65 per litre budgeted). The variance was partly offset by reduced requirements for the acquisition of vehicles owing to the non-acquisition of a medium-sized bus and the lower actual cost of one material-handling vehicle and maintenance services owing to lower actual costs of repairs to damaged vehicles. 28. The unspent balance was primarily attributable to reduced requirements for the rental and operation of three helicopters, related fuel requirements and number of flight hours (actual of 1,048 flight hours compared to 1,320 planned flight hours) owing to the unavailability of one Bell 212 helicopter from March 2011 as a result of technical problems. 29. The unspent balance was primarily attributable to the delay in the establishment of a leased line to the United Nations Support Base in Valencia, Spain. The variance was partly offset by additional requirements for the replacement of UHF equipment. 30. The unspent balance was mainly attributable to reduced requirements for medical supplies. 31. The unspent balance was primarily attributable to reduced requirements for: (a) other services resulting from the discontinuation of grooming services for contingent personnel and lower requirements for advertisements on vacancy announcements and procurement in local newspapers; and (b) lower actual requirements for other freight and related costs. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 32. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNFICYP are: (a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $581,300 with respect to the period from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011; (b) To decide on the treatment of other income for the period ended 30 June 2011 amounting to $1,224,000 from interest income ($138,200), other/miscellaneous income ($599,600) and cancellation of prior-period obligations ($486,200).
