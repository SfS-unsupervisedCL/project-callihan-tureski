This aggression illustrates the bellicose attitude being maintained by the United States of America and the United Kingdom against Iraq. Since 1992, it has become a fixed policy aimed at undermining the country's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and at the systematic and concerted destruction of Iraqi lives, infrastructure and civilian installations. The Government of Iraq categorically rejects the two so-called no-flight zones, which were imposed by unilateral decision of the United States of America and the United Kingdom and lack any legal basis. Iraq rejects all the consequences of this illegal decision and, in particular, the flimsy excuses and pretexts used by these countries in an attempt to justify their military aggression against our country. The logistic support provided by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey to the Americans and the British makes these countries key partners in the aggression being committed against Iraq, so that they bear international responsibility for actions that are deleterious to the people of Iraq. The Government of Iraq, condemning these wanton acts of aggression, urges you to intervene with the governments of the countries in question with a view to inducing them to halt their attacks and to respect the norms of international law and the sovereignty of Iraq.
