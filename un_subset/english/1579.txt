OPENING OF THE SESSION The fifth session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (hereinafter referred to as "the SBI") was held at the Stadthalle Bad Godesberg, Koblenzer Strasse 80, Bonn, from 25 February to 7 March 1997. The Chairman of the SBI, Mr. Mohamed M. Ould El Ghaouth, opened the session at the 1st meeting, on 25 February 1997. In welcoming the participants, he recalled that the fourth session had been brief and focused on a single item, but the fifth session had many items to address. He noted that the fifth session of the SBI would have to take definitive decisions on some issues if the SBI were to complete its workload by the October session. He expressed the hope that delegates would assist him in bringing the session to a successful conclusion. The Executive Secretary welcomed all participants to the session. He noted that the agenda for the session illustrated the diversity of tasks the SBI had to handle. On the review of the financial mechanism, he stated that the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was about to start its replenishment process and it was important that the Parties give a clear and timely signal to the GEF as to their future intentions. On budgetary contributions, he stated that delays in contributions might warrant consideration by the SBI later in the year and, if the status of contributions remained unsatisfactory, by the Conference of the Parties (COP). Concerning support for non-Annex I Parties' initial communications, the Executive Secretary stated that Convention bodies were not well informed about the prospects for receipt of the national communications and that several non-Annex I Parties had announced delays in their completion. He further stated that the secretariat was convinced that there was an urgent need for a modest, lightweight and responsive support arrangement for non-Annex I communications consisting of these elements: a concerted "marketing" effort to ensure that non-Annex I Parties have access to the financial resources they require to prepare their national communications; a central point for collecting information on the progress of communications projects, providing a help-desk function and mobilizing rapid expert assistance; and a programme to enable groups of similar countries to exchange experiences as they prepare their initial communications.

It also noted with appreciation that one Annex I Party had already submitted its second national communication to the secretariat; The SBI welcomed the convening of the informal workshop and took note of the oral report of its Chairmen. It concluded that the workshop served a useful purpose in allowing Parties and observers to exchange information and views on the implementation aspects of specific policies and measures taken by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention. It also requested the secretariat to explore possibilities of exchanging experiences on the implementation of the Convention, including, by further convening workshops on specific topics, when and where necessary in conjunction with future sessions of the SBI. B. Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (Agenda item 3 (b)) At its 4th meeting, on 27 February, the SBI addressed the sub-item on national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention.

Conclusion At its 6th meeting on 28 February, having considered a proposal by the Vice-Chairman, the SBI adopted the following conclusion: The SBI took note of the activities undertaken by the secretariat to facilitate the provision of support to non-Annex I Parties for the preparation of their initial national communications described in document FCCC/SB/1997/INF.1, and requested the secretariat, keeping in view decision 10/CP.2 and Articles 4.3 and 12.5, to continue to report to the SBI at future sessions on further progress achieved. IV. FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION A. Financial mechanism: review process referred to in decision 9/CP.1 (Agenda item 4 (a)) At its 2nd and 7th meetings, on 26 February and 6 March respectively, the SBI addressed the sub-item on the Financial Mechanism: review process referred to in decision 9/CP.1.

Statements were made by the representatives of 11 Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. At its 7th meeting, on 6 March, having considered a proposal from the The SBI noted that in accordance with Article 11.4 of the Convention, the COP by its Decision 9/CP.1 agreed to review the Financial Mechanism within four years of the first COP, and take appropriate measures, including a determination of the definitive status of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in the context of the Convention; The SBI further noted that decision 11/CP.2 mandates the SBI at its fifth session to undertake the review process referred to in decision 9/CP.1 and report on the outcome to the COP at its third session. The SBI, in considering the matter, noted that: The new information at the disposal of this session of the SBI comprised the report prepared by the GEF (see FCCC/SBI/1997/2), discussions at two workshops conducted by the GEF and a question and answer session between the GEF and the SBI. This information was welcomed. In this regard, the Parties would need additional time for the review of the content of the documents; In order to facilitate a fully-informed review, information from other sources, including Parties, would be particularly important; The report of the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly reviewing the implementation of Agenda 21 would be of interest to the SBI in its review of the financial mechanism. Accordingly, the SBI agreed that it would begin the review process on the basis of the guidelines attached in annex II to this document. The SBI invited Parties to submit views on their experience regarding the financial mechanism by May 15, 1997 and requested the secretariat to prepare a compilation of the submissions. The SBI also requested the secretariat, on the basis of the submissions received, and other information as enumerated in the guidelines, to prepare a synthesis report for consideration by the Parties at the sixth session of the SBI. The need for a full replenishment was highlighted during the meeting. B. Information on relevant action by the Council of the Global Environment Facility (Agenda item 4 (b)) At its 2nd meeting, on 26 February, the SBI addressed the sub-item on information on relevant action by the Council of the GEF. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat (FCCC/SBI/1997/MISC. 1).

The SBI deferred consideration of this item until the SBSTA had finished its own consideration of the aspects allotted to it. The SBI took note of the workshop on technology transfer held during this session, and further noted that the SBSTA intended to have a comprehensive debate on technology and technology transfer. The SBI decided to defer the consideration of item 5 and requested the SBSTA to refer to it, as necessary, any items that might require the attention of the SBI. VI. ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS A. Programme budget for 1998 - 1999: perspectives on financial requirements (Agenda item 6 (a)) At its 1st and 3rd meetings, on 25 and 27 February respectively, the SBI addressed the sub-item on the programme budget for 1998-1999: perspectives on financial requirements (FCCC/SBI/1997/3). It had before it a note prepared by the Executive Secretary. Statements were made by the representatives of 12 Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. The SBI endorsed the following timetable and process for the review and adoption of the programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999: A comprehensive programme budget will be proposed in a timely manner by the Executive Secretary for consideration by the SBI at its sixth session in July 1997, which will complete its review of the budget at that session and recommend a budget decision to the COP for adoption; The recommended decision will follow the precedent of that adopted in decision 17/CP.1 at COP 1 (see FCCC/CP/1995/7/Add.1) providing a total budget with allocations by programme, a secretariat-wide staffing table broken down by level, and a provision enabling the Executive Secretary to switch resources among programmes within limits; On account of prevailing uncertainties, some elements of the programme budget may have to be recommended by the SBI as contingencies, depending on decisions of COP 3 or the United Nations General Assembly at its fifty-second session; On the basis of its recommended budget decision, the SBI will authorize the Executive Secretary to notify the Parties by 1 October, 1997 of their indicative contributions due to the core budget by 1 January, 1998; The decision on the programme budget will be adopted by COP 3 as recommended by the SBI, except for any modifications that may result from other decisions of COP 3; Information on financial performance in 1996-1997 will be provided to COP 3, in accordance with paragraph 14 of decision 16/CP.2, (see FCCC/CP/1996/15/Add.1). The SBI requested the Executive Secretary to propose a detailed programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999, specifying the outputs of each programme, for consideration and discussion by the SBI at its sixth session, taking full account of the views expressed by delegations at the fifth session of the SBI; The SBI requested its Chairman to consider convening broadly representative informal intersessional consultations, if feasible, to facilitate possible agreement on the programme budget at its sixth session. B. Volume of documentation (Agenda item 6 (b)) At its 1st and 3rd meetings, on 25 and 27 February, respectively, the SBI addressed the sub-item on the volume of documentation. Statements were made by the representatives of two Parties. At its 6th meeting, on 28 February, having considered a proposal by its The SBI recalled decision 17/CP.2 of the COP at its second session, whereby it requested the Executive Secretary to submit to the SBI, at its fifth session, further options for reducing the cost of documentation for the meetings of the COP and its subsidiary bodies. The SBI took note that the Executive Secretary required more time to prepare recommendations on this matter and would submit them to the SBI at its sixth session; The SBI noted the concern of developing country Parties that the distribution of documents by conventional means be maintained, since many delegates of those Parties did not yet have access to electronic communication media. It requested the secretariat to make provision for the adequate and timely distribution of documents to Parties in paper form; In this connection, the SBI also took note of the policy being applied by the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG), in accordance with General Assembly resolution 36/117B, of 10 December, 1981, not to distribute official documents until all language versions are ready for simultaneous distribution. In the light of this policy, the SBI recommended that the agendas of the Convention bodies should, as far as possible, include only items for which the documents were expected to be available in advance in all the official languages. The SBI considered that there were some types of documents whose consideration could not be scheduled this way, for example the annotated agendas and the reports of sessions of Convention bodies, and the documentation of the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM); In the light of these considerations, the SBI requested the Executive Secretary to explore with the UNOG the possibility that, when justified by exceptional circumstances, as indicated above, each language version of a document may be distributed by UNOG as it became available. VII. LEGAL MATTERS A. Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement (Agenda item 7 (a)) At its 3rd meeting, on 27 February, the SBI addressed the sub-item on the implementation of the Headquarters Agreement. The SBI took note of the actions by the United Nations and the Government of Germany to complete the formal requirements for the entry into force of the Agreement among the United Nations, the Government of Germany and the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) concerning the headquarters of the Convention secretariat, and requested the secretariat to provide to the SBI, relevant information at its next session. B. Action by the Depositary of the Convention (Agenda item 7 (b)) At its 3rd meeting, on 27 February, the SBI addressed the sub-item on action by the Depositary of the Convention. The SBI took note of the opinion provided by the Treaty Office of the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs on the request of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic that the name of Czechoslovakia be deleted from Annex I to the Convention, and that the names of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic be included in Annex I and decided to recommend to the COP to take up the request from the Czech and Slovak Republics when it comes to review the lists in Annexes I and II to the Convention. VIII. MATTERS ARISING FROM THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY A. Special session on Agenda 21: inputs from the UNFCCC (Agenda item 8 (a)) At its 2nd and 3rd meetings, on 26 and 27 February, respectively, the SBI addressed the sub-item on the Special session on Agenda 21: inputs from the UNFCCC.

The SBI took note of the action taken by the United Nations General Assembly, at its fifty-first session, on matters related to the UNFCCC and requested the Executive Secretary to report on the review of administrative arrangements at its sixth session. IX. ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS A. The third session of the Conference of the Parties (Agenda item 9 (a)) At its 1st meeting, on 25 February, the SBI addressed the sub-item on the third session of the Conference of the Parties. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat (FCCC/SBI/1997/5). Statements were made by representatives of 11 Parties, including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The SBI took note with satisfaction of the arrangements that were being made by the Government of Japan as the host Party of COP 3 and it looked forward to additional information concerning these arrangements, in particular on the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding between the Government of Japan and the secretariat of the UNFCCC related to the hosting of the session at Kyoto, Japan; The SBI requested the Executive Secretary to provide a note at its sixth session, containing a list of possible elements for the provisional agenda for COP 3 focused on the completion of the work of the Berlin Mandate and its adoption and taking account of views expressed at its current session; Regarding the organization of work of COP 3, the SBI recommended that: COP 3 would be held from Monday, 1 to Wednesday, 10 December 1997; After dealing with the opening and organizational matters, COP 3 would immediately allocate the completion of decisions on the Berlin Mandate process to a sessional committee of the whole, open to all delegations; In order to finalize the political negotiations on the outcome of the Berlin Mandate, a ministerial segment would take place from Monday, 8 December to Wednesday, 10 December, when the final text of a protocol or another legal instrument would be adopted; Any new substantive proposals, including proposals affecting the purpose and organization of the ministerial segment, should be communicated to all Parties well in advance of the Conference, in accordance with the normal United Nations practice. The SBI requested the secretariat to propose, at its sixth session a cost effective and innovative way of organizing the ministerial segment, and providing ministers with adequate opportunities to exchange views on policy matters; It also requested the secretariat to propose arrangements for the communication of views by heads of United Nations programmes and agencies, IGOs and NGOs.

X. REPORT ON THE SESSION The SBI requested the Rapporteur, with the assistance of the secretariat, to complete the report of the session taking into account the discussions during the session and the need for editorial adjustments. The Vice-Chairman, on behalf of the Chairman, after thanking all participants for their cooperation throughout the meeting, declared the fifth session of the SBI closed.

Annex III SPECIAL SESSION ON AGENDA 21: CONCLUSIONS The SBI endorsed the elements contained in document FCCC/SBI/1997/4 as revised and reproduced below and requested the Executive Secretary to forward them to the special session on Agenda 21 of the United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was adopted in 1992, has received 165 instruments of ratification or accession assuring almost universal membership of States. The Convention was one of the key outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), and its objectives have a close relationship to the goals of sustainable development. It has linkages to the framework of Agenda 21, with relation to energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forests, water and waste management. An important element in the global effort to address climate change and its impacts is the open exchange of information on the implementation of commitments of Parties under the Convention. This also contributes to developing international debate on longer-term trends in consumption and production patterns, in accordance with Agenda 21. National communications are submitted so that Parties inform each other of how they are meeting their commitments under the Convention and describe their climate change programmes and how these programmes will affect greenhouse gas emissions and sinks by the year 2000. In addition, the UNFCCC secretariat is mandated by the Parties to the Convention to prepare a compilation and synthesis of the national communications for consideration by them. A second such compilation and synthesis was submitted to the second session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in which it considered the national communications of 33 Annex I Parties. The document provides an overview of the implementation of the Convention by reporting Parties, noting trends and patterns, areas of convergence and divergence, data gaps and other appropriate conclusions, including the overall effects of policies and measures. It demonstrated that while Annex I Parties are fulfilling their commitments to the implementation of national policies and measures on the mitigation of climate change, they need to make additional efforts to overcome difficulties that they face in achieving the aim of returning their emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Another link to furthering the goals of sustainable development is the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose Second Assessment Report is considered to be the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment now available of the scientific and technical information regarding global climate change. The IPCC has now initiated steps towards preparation of its Third Assessment Report to develop a better objective scientific understanding of issues related to climate change, its impacts and possible response options. This report is expected to enhance the formulation of climate change policies in the context of sustainable development. New initiatives for cooperative implementation, including technology transfer and diffusion, between all Parties to the Convention and with the major groups in civil society are also being explored by the Parties to the Convention. Through these linkages the key themes of Agenda 21 pertaining to integrated policy development, citizen participation in decision-making, institutional and human capacity building and global partnerships involving many stakeholders, are being addressed by the UNFCCC. The UNFCCC has also taken first steps to deal with the continued rise of emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases. The Berlin Mandate agreed by the first Conference of the Parties is the basis for considerable efforts under way in the Ad hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM). The COP, at its second session, called, inter alia, for acceleration of negotiations of the text of a protocol, or another legal instrument which would fully encompass the remit of the Berlin Mandate. The General Assembly, at its special session, may wish to encourage member States to agree on a satisfactory result of these negotiations at the third session of the COP, scheduled to be held in Kyoto in December 1997. Steps are being taken by developing country Parties to prepare their initial communication of information related to implementation. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), as the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention, is supporting developing country Parties in implementing their commitments by funding enabling activities such as planning and endogenous capacity building. The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) called on the GEF to provide expeditious and timely support to these Parties and initiate work towards a full replenishment in 1997. Further international action in the implementation of Agenda 21 will help to involve the whole international community in promoting the effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Noting the relevant provisions of Agenda 21 relating to the transfer of environmentally sound technology, cooperation and capacity building, the COP at its first and second sessions took decisions related to these issues. The General Assembly may also wish to pay special attention to the transfer of technology.
