General Assembly Sixtieth session Agenda item 14 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Sixty-first year Letter dated 5 June 2006 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General On instructions from my Government, I transmit to you herewith a detailed statistical table showing the violations of Lebanese sovereignty committed by Israel during the month of May 2006. A total of 139 violations were committed (see annex). These violations are in contravention of the relevant Security Council resolutions, the latest of which is resolution 1655 (2006), and in defiance of your repeated calls for their cessation, most recently in your report S/2006/26 of 18 January 2006. Lebanon counts on the United Nations to compel Israel to desist from such violations, which constitute a threat to international peace and security, and holds Israel responsible for any consequences to which its actions may give rise. I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annex circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 14, "The situation in the Middle East", and of the Security Council.
