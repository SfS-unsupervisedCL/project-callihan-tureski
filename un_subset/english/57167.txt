The Cuban people, which has suffered the consequences of terrorism for more than 50 years, condemns this scourge in all its forms and manifestations. The Cuban Government and people extend their condolences to the Norwegian Government and people, particularly the families of the victims, for the loss of life and the damage caused by these criminal actions, while expressing their solidarity and support.
