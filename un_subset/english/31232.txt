national staff in 2004/05 owing to the downsizing of the Mission 3.1.2 The percentage of total inventory value awaiting write-off and disposal will be reduced from 1.9 per cent as at 30 June 2003 to 0.8 per cent as at 30 June 2005 and surplus stock holdings are to be reduced in value from 12.47 per cent of monthly holdings in 2003/04 to 8.1 per cent in 2004/05 The value of inventory awaiting write-off and disposal increased to 5.4 per cent of total inventory value as at 30 June 2005 owing to the ageing of the assets and to a delay in the planned sale of assets to the PISG attributable to PISG budgetary process Surplus stock holdings stood at 12.54 per cent of total inventory value as at 30 June 2005 owing to increasing number of items returned to inventory following the downsizing of the staffing level of the Mission 3.1.3 A 15 per cent increase in utilization rates for UNMIK vehicles, from the current rate of 1,915 kms per vehicle per month for standard vehicles and 1,041 kms per vehicle per month for heavy trucks to 2,202 kms per vehicle per month for standard vehicles and 1,197 kms per vehicle per month for heavy trucks in 2004/05 Utilization rates decreased to 1,680 kms per vehicle per month for standard vehicles and 740 kms per vehicle per month for heavy vehicles, owing to the drawdown of the Mission's activities, in particular the handing over of the civilian police patrolling duties to the Kosovo Police Service and the repatriation of special police units 3.1.4 Reduced rates of traffic accidents involving UNMIK personnel The rate of traffic accidents has reduced from an average of 14 accidents per month in 2003/04 to an average of 12.8 accidents per month during 2004/05 3.1.5 Outsourcing of 6 management and maintenance services to local contractors, including

police units Civilian police 3,055 civilian police serviced, including rotations, payments and transport support Average civilian police monthly strength Civilian personnel An average of 3,695 international and national staff per month administered, including in respect of career development and payment of mission subsistence allowance and other entitlements Total average numbers of 718 international staff, 2,692 national staff and 207 United Nations Volunteers Outsourcing of 6 management and maintenance services to local contractors, resulting in a reduction of operational costs by some $1.3 million and a reduction of 5 international and 35 national-level posts in supply and engineering fields during the period from October 2004 to April 2005 Requirements for maintenance services were further reduced by $358,800, resulting from a revision of the Mission's plan of alteration, renovation and construction projects with a view to achieving savings, and from the handover of a higher than planned number of premises to the local government The UNMIK 2004-05 downsizing plan, including a reduction of 135 international posts and 134 national-level posts from June 2004 to June 2005, implemented without interruption of support services International staff posts reduced National staff posts reduced Official travel 2,402 personnel trained in the areas of communications, information technology, transport, security, air safety, finance, supplies, engineering and language skills Personnel trained. The lower number was due to a revision of the Mission's training requirements with a view to achieving savings and to the cancellation of administrative training for security reasons Facilities and infrastructure 120 premises Kosovo-wide maintained, including Mission and administrative headquarters, 3 regional headquarters, 5 premises in municipalities, 5 logistics bases and 4 clinics Premises maintained. The reduced number resulted from the handover of 55 premises to the local government Ground transportation 1,871 vehicles managed, including distribution, control, repair and maintenance, for civilian police and international and local staff Vehicles managed In addition, repaired and maintained 53 non-United Nations-owned vehicles (contingent-owned vehicles, vehicles from United Nations agencies, the European Union and the Council of Europe) and 41 items of workshop equipment Air transportation 1 fixed-wing aircraft and 1 helicopter operated with 30 monthly block hours each, utilized in police operations, including witness protection and reconnaissance and VIP and liaison flights; 3,800 passengers and 3 tons of cargo delivered, and 156 shuttle flights to Belgrade completed Helicopter (30 monthly block hours until 30 November 2004, 20 flight hours per month thereafter) Fixed-wing aircraft, terminated on 10 May 2005 owing to high operational cost Passengers Ton of cargo delivered Shuttle flights to Belgrade Communications 3 information programmes dedicated to core policy goals of UNMIK aired at prime time in Kosovo Programmes aired (Danas i Sutra, UN Report and Ekonomia e Re) Information technology An average of 3,500 communications and information technology users, excluding civilian police and members of formed police units, supported monthly by access to telephone, fax, e-mail and the Internet, where applicable Extensions for telephone and fax Network users E-mail accounts Integrated inventory management fully operational Galileo operational since 17 June 2005 Medical UNMIK 12-bed health-care centre and regional clinics with a total capacity of 20,000 patients per year operated Patients served in 12-bed health-care facility and 4 regional clinics.

The reduced requirements were due mainly to lower expenditures for mission subsistence allowance, which resulted from a lower average euro/United States dollar exchange rate during the period than estimated for calculating costs and from a vacancy rate of 2.9 per cent whereas the cost estimates assumed no vacancies. 8. Final expenditures were in line with projected expenditures for 2004/05 as contained in the note by the Secretary-General (A/59/692) on financing arrangements for UNMIK for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The increased requirements resulted from additional mission subsistence allowance requirements, as stated in the note. The Mission reprioritized funds and deferred some planned expenditures under operational costs in order to absorb these additional requirements within the total amount appropriated for the Mission for 2004/05. 9. The increased requirements were attributable mainly to the fact that estimates for cost for reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment were based on seven formed police units deployed from July 2004 to March 2005, whereas eight units were actually deployed during this period. 10. Final expenditures were in line with projected expenditures for 2004/05 as contained in the note by the Secretary-General (A/59/692) on financing arrangements for UNMIK for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The additional requirements were attributable to a higher actual ratio of common staff costs to net salaries than originally estimated in the 2004/05 budget, as set out in the note. The Mission reprioritized funds and deferred some planned expenditures under operational costs in order to absorb these additional requirements within the total amount appropriated for the Mission for 2004/05. 11. Final expenditures were in line with projected expenditures for 2004/05 as contained in the note by the Secretary-General (A/59/692) on financing arrangements for UNMIK for the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005. The additional requirements were due to revised salary scales, as set out in the note. The Mission reprioritized funds and deferred some planned expenditures under operational costs in order to absorb these additional requirements within the total amount appropriated for the Mission for 2004/05. 12. The lower requirements were mainly attributable to the actual vacancy rate of 17.3 per cent over the financial period, whereas no vacancy rate was assumed in the budget. 13. The additional requirements resulted from the need, identified after the March 2004 riots, to hire on a short-term basis seven individual contractors to address issues of public awareness, missing persons and forensics, law enforcement and field integration. 14. The expenditure related to the short-term hiring of five consultants, following the March 2004 riots, to assess the political implications of the riots, to oversee the Mission's security operations, to assist in the formulation and implementation of policies addressing the concerns of minority communities and to increase trust between majority and minority communities, and to create an archaeological inventory. 15. The reduced requirements resulted mainly from the fact that the Mission revised its travel plan, particularly in the areas of civil administration, police assessment and administrative support, as well as its training plan, particularly in the areas of communications, information technology and air operations, with a view to achieving savings. 16. The lower requirements were attributable mainly to the implementation of economy measures, which included a revision of the Mission's plan for alteration, renovation and construction projects resulting in cancellation of or reduction in the scope of some projects, the introduction of e-requests for supplies and services, enhanced utilization of spare parts salvaged from damaged and obsolete equipment, preventive maintenance work on equipment and better utilization of existing spare parts stocks. 17. The lower requirements were due mainly to the fact that the Mission received at no cost (except for freight cost) 72 4x4 vehicles from the surplus stock of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire. 18. The lower requirements resulted primarily from reduced flying hours of the helicopter as well as the fixed-wing aircraft, which contract was terminated in May 2005. 19. The lower requirements were due to the fact that the Mission had to postpone the procurement of some of its communications equipment as well as of some of its spare parts in order to accommodate the additional requirements under military and police personnel and under civilian personnel. 20. The lower requirements were due to the fact that the Mission had to postpone the procurement of some of its information technology equipment as well as of some of its software packages in order to accommodate the additional requirements under military and police personnel and under civilian personnel. 21. The lower requirements were due mainly to lower than estimated needs for medical services as well as for the replacement of medical equipment. 22. The increased requirements were attributable to higher self-sustainment cost than estimated, as cost estimates were based on average reimbursement rates since the specific formed police units which would be repatriated in 2004/05 were not known at the time of budget preparation. 23. The reduced requirements were attributable mainly to the signing of a new contract with more favourable terms for the high performance photocopying needs of the Mission. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 24. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNMIK are: (a) To decide that Member States shall waive their respective shares in other income for the period ended 30 June 2005 amounting to $10,295,400, and their respective shares in the amount of $31,000 from the unencumbered balance of $128,200 for the period ended 30 June 2005, to be applied to meeting the current and future after-service health insurance liabilities of the United Nations; (b) To decide on the treatment of the remaining unencumbered balance of $97,200 for the period ended 30 June 2005.
