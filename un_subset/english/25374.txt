Japan will newly organize a program to receive 30 responsible officials annually from FY2003 to FY2007 (for a total of 150 officials in 5 years), in order to improve capacity for risk management in combating terrorism. Japan will also organize a seminar to encourage accession to counter-terrorism related international conventions. The purpose of this seminar is to promote terrorism-related international conventions among officials of those countries that have not yet acceded to some recent counter-terrorism conventions. The information on other measures is presented on pages 5, 6 and 7 of S/2001/1306. 25. Areas of incomplete implementation of the sanctions regime 26. Additional information
