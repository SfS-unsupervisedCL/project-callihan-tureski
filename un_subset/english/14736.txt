Resolution adopted by the General Assembly [on the report of the Third Committee (A/55/600)] 55/83. Measures to combat contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 54/153 of 17 December 1999, and taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2000/14 of 17 April 2000, Stressing that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 attaches importance to the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, Convinced that racism, as one of the exclusionist phenomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Having examined the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including its conclusions and recommendations, Deeply concerned that, despite continued efforts, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and acts of violence persist and even grow in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, Particularly alarmed at the increase in racist violence in many parts of the world, inter alia, as a result of resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, as reflected in the report of the Special Rapporteur, and at the persisting use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies, Deeply concerned that those advocating racism and racial discrimination misuse new communication technologies, including the Internet, to disseminate their repugnant views, Noting that the use of such technologies can also contribute to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance that are increasingly visible in segments of many societies and are perpetrated by individuals or groups, some of which manifestations are directed against migrant workers and members of their families, Reaffirming, in this regard, the responsibility of Governments for safeguarding and protecting the rights of individuals within their jurisdiction against crimes perpetrated by racist or xenophobic individuals or groups, Recognizing both the challenges and the opportunities in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in an increasingly globalized world, Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, marginalization and social exclusion, Deeply concerned that racism and racial discrimination against migrant workers continue to increase despite the efforts undertaken by the international community to protect the human rights of migrant workers and members of their families, Noting that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its general recommendation XV (42) of 17 March 1993 concerning article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, holds that the prohibition of the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or racial hatred is compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and expression as outlined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in article 5 of the Convention, Noting also that the reports that the States parties submit under the Convention contain, inter alia, information about the causes of, as well as measures to combat, contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Noting with concern the existence of multiple discrimination, in particular against women, Particularly alarmed at the rise of racist and xenophobic ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, Noting with appreciation that the Special Rapporteur will continue to pay attention to the rise of racist and xenophobic ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Recognizing that failure to combat racial discrimination and xenophobia, especially by public authorities and politicians, is a factor encouraging their perpetuation in society, Emphasizing the importance of creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance within societies, 1. Reaffirms the proclamation of 2001 as the International Year of Mobilization against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance; 2. Calls upon the relevant United Nations bodies, Member States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to carry out, promote and disseminate activities and action within the framework of the commemorative year in order to strengthen its impact and ensure its success, in particular the outcome of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance; 3.

Commends the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination for its role in the effective implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,5 which contributes to the fight against contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 8.

Declares that racism and racial discrimination are among the most serious violations of human rights in the contemporary world and must be combated by all available means; 10. Expresses its profound concern about and unequivocal condemnation of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in particular all racist violence, including related acts of random and indiscriminate violence; 11. Also expresses its profound concern about and unequivocal condemnation of all forms of racism and racial discrimination, including propaganda, activities and organizations based on doctrines of superiority of one race or group of persons that attempt to justify or promote racism and racial discrimination in any form; 12. Further expresses its profound concern about and condemnation of manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against, and stereotyping of, migrant workers and members of their families, persons belonging to minorities and members of vulnerable groups in many societies; 13. Notes with great concern that, despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related forms of intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase in many parts of the world, and that the number of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic charters is increasing, as reflected in the report of the Special Rapporteur; 14. Encourages all States to include in their educational curricula and social programmes at all levels, as appropriate, knowledge of and tolerance and respect for foreign cultures, peoples and countries; 15.

Condemns the misuse of print, audio-visual and electronic media and new communication technologies, including the Internet, to incite violence motivated by racial hatred; 19. Recognizes that Governments should implement and enforce appropriate and effective legislation to prevent acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights violations; 20.
