Introduction 1. At its 44th meeting, on 16 November 2004, the Third Committee adopted a draft resolution entitled "International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families" (A/C.3/59/L.31, as orally revised). At the time of adoption of the draft resolution, the Third Committee was provided with a statement of programme budget implications (A/C.3/59/L.63). 2. Under the terms of operative paragraph 3 of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.31, the General Assembly would welcome the establishment of the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, as well as the report of its first session,1 which took place from 1 to 5 March 2004, and takes note of the rules of procedure adopted by the Committee. 3. Paragraph 8 of the report of the Committee states that the Committee decided to request the Secretary-General to arrange two sessions for the Committee in 2005, one in July and one in October. Each session would be of one week's duration. This arrangement would replace a three-week session, which had been initially programmed in the budgetary estimates prepared before the establishment of the Committee, only for 2005. The sessions of the Committee will be held at the United Nations Office at Geneva. II. Relationship of the proposed request to the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 and the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 4. The activities to be carried out would relate to programme 19, Human rights, of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 and section 24, Human rights, of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005. III. Modification of the approved programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 5. In order to reflect the provisions of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.31, in the narrative of subprogramme 2, Supporting human rights bodies and organs, of section 24 of the programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005, the first subparagraph of paragraph 24.43 (a) (x), on the Committee on the Protection of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, would be modified to read as follows: "a. Substantive servicing of meetings: plenary meetings (50)". IV. Estimates of resource requirements 6. The full cost of the activities envisaged under the terms of this decision would amount to $891,300 in the biennium 2004-2005. The total cost of the three-week session in 2005 as currently approved by the General Assembly would amount to $1,120,400. The arrangement of two one-week sessions would result in the following: (a) Additional requirements for travel of the Committee members in the amount of $12,200, which is anticipated to be absorbed within overall resources included in the programme budget for the biennium under section 24, Human rights; (b) Estimated savings of $238,100 and $3,200 under section 2, General Assembly affairs and conference services, and section 29E, Administration, Geneva, respectively, of the programme budget for the biennium. 7. The actual savings resulting from the reduction of conference-servicing requirements will be reported to the General Assembly in the context of the second performance report for the biennium 2004-2005 under section 2 and section 29E, respectively. 8. The adoption of draft resolution A/C.3/59/L.31, as orally revised, would not give rise to any additional requirements under the programme budget for 2004-2005. The actual savings resulting from the reduction of conference-servicing requirements will be reported to the General Assembly in the context of the second performance report for the biennium 2004-2005.
