Third session New York, 26 April-7 May 2004 Working paper on the Middle East nuclear issue submitted by China The Chinese Delegation hereby requests that the following elements be incorporated in the recommendations to the 2005 Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Regional security and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are closely interrelated. Therefore the parties concerned should find a solution to the Middle East issue in a spirit of reconciliation. The United Nations, the Security Council in particular, should be supported to play a more active role in this process. The parties concerned should strictly implement their agreements and common understanding on the basis of the relevant UN resolutions and the principle of "land for peace". The proposition and efforts by Middle East countries to establish a zone free of nuclear weapons and other WMDs in the Middle East should be supported. Efforts should be made to promote the establishment of such a zone in accordance with the UN General Assembly resolutions and the provisions of the resolution on the Middle East adopted at the 1995 Review Conference. Libya decided to abandon its WMD programs and accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran decided to continue its cooperation with the IAEA for an early clarification of unresolved questions. These are all significant and positive for establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons or other WMDs in the Middle East. Israel's accession to the NPT and placement of all its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards is essential for strengthening the international non-proliferation regime and establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons or other WMDs in the Middle East.
