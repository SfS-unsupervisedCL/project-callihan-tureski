Commission on Sustainable Development Fourteenth session 1-12 May 2006 Item 3 of the provisional agenda* Thematic cluster for the implementation cycle 2006-2007 -- review session Major groups discussion papers on energy for sustainable development, industrial development, air pollution/atmosphere and climate change Note by the Secretariat 1. In the decisions adopted at its eleventh session, the Commission on Sustainable Development called for strengthened involvement and enhanced participation of major groups in the activities of the Commission, as well as in the implementation of Agenda 21, the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. 2. In response, the Bureau of the fourteenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, building on the participatory practices of the Commission, the World Summit on Sustainable Development and, in particular, the Commission's first implementation cycle, decided that participation of major groups would be integrated throughout the review session, including panel discussions, expert presentations and multi-stakeholder discussions, including at the ministerial level. Major group experts and practitioners active in the thematic areas of energy for sustainable development, industrial development, air pollution/atmosphere and climate change would be invited to share their experiences and lessons learned and to exchange practical approaches in implementation. 3. The organization of the input and contributions of major groups to the fourteenth session has been inspired by practices used at past sessions of the Commission through a multi-stakeholder "steering group" composed of organizing partners from network organizations representing the nine major groups. These organizing partners are: the Women's Environment and Development Organization and ENERGIA, an international network on women and sustainable energy for women; the Youth Caucus of the Commission on Sustainable Development for youth and children; the Indigenous Peoples' Caucus of the Commission on Sustainable Development, Tebtebba -- the Indigenous Peoples' International Centre for Policy Research and Education, the Centre for Organization Research and Education (CORE) and the Indigenous Environmental Network for indigenous people; the Sustainable Development Issues Network (through the Northern Alliance for Sustainability, the Third World Network and the Environment Liaison Centre International) for non-governmental organizations; the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives for local authorities; the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (through the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) for workers and trade unions; the Business Action for Energy, the International Chamber of Commerce and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development for business and industry; the International Council for Science and the World Federation of Engineering Organizations for scientific and technological communities; and the International Federation of Agricultural Producers for farmers. The organizing partners facilitated the preparation of discussion papers, which will appear as addenda to the present note. 4. The discussion papers reflect the overall views of the major groups on the status of implementation of commitments made related to energy for sustainable development, industrial development, air pollution/atmosphere and climate change and include references to cross-sectoral themes, successes and challenges of implementation and practical contributions. These discussion papers will provide a basis for the review input of major groups and will serve as a starting point for their participation in the activities of the fourteenth session. 5. Views and proposed solutions of the major groups to meet challenges and overcome problems related to the topics being reviewed should inform decisions of the Commission at its fifteenth session (policy session) as Governments make use of or endorse them at the negotiation stage and thus allow for meaningful and direct contributions by stakeholder groups to the decisions and work of the Commission.
