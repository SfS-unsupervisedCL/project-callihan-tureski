Letter dated 2 May 2002 from the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to refer to my letter dated 4 March 2002 (S/2002/235), in which I informed the President of the Security Council of the new mandate of the Monitoring Group established pursuant to resolution 1363 (2001), as stipulated in resolution 1390 (2002). I also referred to the composition of the Monitoring Group: Michael Chandler (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), Philippe Graver (France), Michael D. Langan (United States of America), Hassan H. Ali Abaza (Jordan) and Surendra Bahadur Shah (Nepal). I was subsequently informed that Mr. Langan had resigned from the Group for personal reasons. Accordingly, in consultation with the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 (1999), and taking into account the requirements stated in the above-mentioned resolutions, I wish to inform you that I have appointed Victor D. Comras (United States of America) to replace Mr. Langan. (Signed) Kofi A. Annan
