Letter dated 11 April 2011 from the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to present my compliments and to refer to Security Council resolution 1973 (2011) adopted on 17 March 2011. In accordance with paragraphs 4 and 8 of that resolution, I hereby notify you that the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan will take measures under the authorizations conferred in those paragraphs which are necessary to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack in Libya, including assisting in securing humanitarian aid and enforcing compliance with the ban on flights in Libyan airspace imposed by paragraph 6 of that resolution. I can confirm the intention of my Government to inform you immediately of any measures taken in the exercise of these authorizations. I would be grateful if you would circulate the present letter as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein Ambassador Permanent Representative
