From 1998 to the end of 2009 I was a member of the Council of Europe's CPT, elected in respect of Slovenia. I was re-elected twice. As a CPT member I participated in visits to many State Parties and was often the head of the visiting delegation. I have more than 15 years of experience in monitoring of places of deprivation of liberty in Slovenia and in many other countries. I am also closely involved in dealing with police complaints procedures (impunity issues) and anti-torture issues. Since the adoption of the OPCAT my work has been closely related to the promotion of NPMs in Europe and Asia. I was involved in the drafting of the Slovenian Act on the ratification of the OPCAT. It was my idea to designate the Ombudsman as the NPM in Slovenia and to invite NGOs and civil society to closely cooperate in the NPM in the way that is perhaps so far a unique experience. List of most recent publications in the field: I wrote numerous articles on various legal subjects and participated at various conferences, seminars, workshops and forums at home and abroad. Some of my recent publications/presentations: External monitoring of prisons: ECPT and OPCAT, some basic standards to prevent ill-treatment (EC; Workshop on Recognition of Torture in Detention, Skopje, FYROM May 2011) The role of judges and prosecutors in preventing torture and their response to allegations of torture (APT, Nepal, June 2010 and OSCE, FYROM, June 2011) "Will police be investigating themselves again?" Pravna Praksa, September 2010) ECPT and OPCAT, the standards and parts of the reports on Turkey (The Council of Europe/EU joint programme on dissemination of model prison practices and promotion of the prison reform in Turkey - Izmir, April 2010) Implementation of OPCAT - the Slovenian experience (Twinning-Light project "Support for setting up an efficient NPM for increased promotion and protection of human rights in the places of detention" Bucharest, Romania, June 2010) "Quo vadis, ombudsman", Pravna Praksa, Ljubljana, 2009 Hate crime in Slovenia (8th European Conference, International Association of Prosecutors, The Hague, 2008) Domah, Satyabhooshun Gupt Date and place of birth: 30 September 1946 Working languages: English, French, Hindi and Creole Judge of Appeal of the Republic of Seychelles Judge of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Mauritius Lecturer at Associate Professor Level in Constitutional and Administrative Law at the University of Mauritius Lecturer at Associate Professor Level in Constitutional and Administrative Law at the University of Technology, Mauritius A major portion of my work on the Bench comprises application of the fundamental freedoms and liberties of the individual in a democratic system of Government. For the purpose, I use legal and judicial materials from national, regional, European and United Nations sources. The hierarchical level of my functions is the highest national legal system of the two jurisdictions, except that for Mauritius it is just one level short of the Privy Council. My daily work consists of, inter alia, determining the legitimacy and legality of State action, whether through police, prisons or otherwise, judged from international human right norms. Likewise, a major portion of the Law Module which I teach at the two Universities concerns the day-to-day application of, and adherence to, the civil and political rights as well as the economic and social rights of the individual in a constitutional democracy with an entrenched Bill of Rights under the Rule of Law. One whole chapter is dedicated to the judicious use as opposed to the arbitrary/despotic use of power of State and State agencies. The supporting materials come from jurisprudence from national courts as seen by Human Rights Committee decisions as propagated by, inter alia, relevant UN agencies. Doctorate in Comparative Law, University of Aix-Marseilles D.E.S. in Comparative Law, University of Aix-Marseilles Masters in International Law, University of London Bachelor in Laws, University of London Bar at Law, Member of Middle Temple Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, University of London Other main activities in the field of human rights relevant to the mandate of the Committee against Torture: I was Parliamentary Counsel in the State Law Office when I actively involved my then Office to formulate and draft the article of our Criminal Code which would specifically criminalize torture in Mauritius. That was prompted by a comment in the report of the UN Committee against Torture. The text was duly passed by our Parliament soon after I was elevated to the Bench. I lectured on the Human Rights in the BSC Degree Course in Police Studies at the University of Mauritius. This module includes criminal prosecutions against torture and the materials include the UN materials on the subject, including the United Nations Convention against Torture 1984 and the related Optional Protocols. I am often called upon to give Key-Note Addresses to Conferences and Workshops, at national and international forums, on issues touching Human Rights in society and in the law such as Law of Organized Crime, Mutual Legal Assistance, Terrorism etc. Many of my materials are on Power-Points and are distributed to participants on CD's and hard copies. Some of the judgments I have given on human rights in Mauritius have made landmarks in our jurisprudence. List of most recent publications in this field: I have a number of publications since early age which include human rights issues then broadcast in the World Service of the BBC. However, the ones relevant to the field of our present concern and which are recent are: Constitutionae Africae, University of Antwerp Publications, Germany, 1994 The Mauritian Constitution and Civil and Political Rights, Encyclopaedia of World Constitutions, USA, 2006 University Study Materials on Constitutional and Administrative Law (Civil and Political Rights and Social and Economic Rights) (on-going) Monograph on Law of Terrorism, International Security Studies (ISS), 2003 Monograph on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal and Related Matters, International Security Studies, Cape Town, 2004 Monograph on the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime in the SADC region, (ISS) 2006 Monograph on Prevention of Corruption in the SADC region, (ISS) 2007 Gaer, Felice Date and place of birth: 16 June 1946, Englewood, New Jersey, USA Working languages: English and Russian Member, Committee against Torture (Vice-Chair 2004 - 6, 2009 - present; Rapporteur on follow-up), 2000 - present Director, Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, American Jewish Committee, 1993 - present Regents Professor, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), 2010 Main Professional activities: Developing programs for the promotion and protection of human rights, with particular attention to international and regional human rights institutions Author of articles, chapters in books and reports on compliance with human rights standards, particularly efforts of international institutions in setting and reviewing those standards, e.g. United Nations, African Commission on Human Rights, etc. Research and participation in programs to advance reform and functioning of UN human rights bodies.
