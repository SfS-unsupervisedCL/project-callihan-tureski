Fifty-eighth session Fifth Committee Agenda items 110 and 121 Advancement of women Programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 Future operations of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women Programme budget implications of draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36 Statement submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly Summary By draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36, the General Assembly would decide to continue providing its full support to the current efforts to revitalize the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), and in this regard to provide complementary funds, if needed, to ensure that the Institute will have adequate resources to function for a period of one year and to prepare the report requested in resolution 57/311, in the light of the delay in appointing a Director to implement a feasible work programme and fund-raising activities. The period of one year indicated in paragraph 5 of draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36 would be from 1 January to 31 December 2004. It is estimated that with the recent appointment of the Director, the estimated balance in the INSTRAW Trust Fund would enable the Institute to continue its operations through September 2004. It is not possible at this stage to determine whether the Institute would have adequate resources to operate to 31 December 2004 without complementary funds. Contingent upon the availability or otherwise of additional voluntary contributions prior to September 2004, an additional amount of $234,700 may be required from the regular budget of the United Nations to maintain the Institute in 2004. 1. At its 57th meeting, on 26 November 2003, the Third Committee adopted draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36 by a recorded vote of 126 to 5, with 33 abstentions. A statement of the programme budget implications of the draft resolution was before the Committee in document A/C.3/58/L.86, the content of which is reproduced below for consideration by the Fifth Committee. I. Requests contained in the draft resolution 2. Under the terms of operative paragraph 5 of draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36, the General Assembly would decide to continue providing its full support to the current efforts to revitalize the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), and in this regard to provide complementary funds, if needed, to ensure that the Institute will have adequate resources to function for a period of one year and to prepare the report requested in resolution 57/311 of 18 June 2003, in the light of the delay in appointing a Director to implement a feasible work programme and fund-raising activities. II. Procedures for administrative and budgetary matters 3. As paragraph 5 of draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36 deals with administrative and budgetary matters, the attention of the Committee is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed also the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. Under the circumstances, the consideration by the Third Committee of paragraph 5 of draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36 may be considered to be in contravention of resolution 45/248 B. III. Background 4. In paragraph 7 of General Assembly resolution 57/311, the Institute was requested to report to the Assembly, one year after the appointment of a Director, on its programme of work and on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (see A/56/907). 5. The General Assembly, in its decision 57/580 of 20 December 2002 and resolution 57/311, approved a total amount of $500,000, as a charge against the contingency fund, to finance the core activities of the Institute in 2003. 6. It is recalled that the recommendations of the Working Group on the future operations of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women were submitted to the General Assembly on 16 August and 3 October 2002 (A/57/330 and Add.1). In its resolution 57/175 of 18 December 2002, the Assembly endorsed the recommendations of the Working Group and requested the Secretary-General to implement the measures recommended by the Working Group in this regard. A related statement of programme budget implications, submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly (A/C.3/57/L.82), indicated, inter alia, that in order to implement all the provisions contained in paragraph 57 of the report of the Working Group, the amount of $1,309,500 per year, in addition to the recommended provision of $500,000 from the regular budget, would be needed. 7. The report of the Working Group to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session (A/58/540) elaborates on the implementation of its recommendations contained in A/57/330 and Add.1. It is noted, in this connection, that due to the financial situation of the Institute, some of these recommendations, especially those on creating the post of Deputy Director and establishing a liaison for INSTRAW in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, cannot be implemented. The Working Group has been provided, upon its request, with additional written information on the financial situation of the Institute. Most recently, information was provided immediately after the meeting of the Working Group in May 2003. IV. Current financial situation 8. In 2003, the financial situation of the Institute remained precarious. As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the financial situation of the Institute (A/58/426), requested in resolution 57/311, in addition to the United Nations regular budget grant of $500,000, only $149,370, including $130,924 in voluntary contributions and $18,446 in miscellaneous income, had been received in the INSTRAW Trust Fund as at 30 September 2003. It was estimated in that report that the balance of the INSTRAW Trust Fund as at 31 December 2003 would be approximately $453,551. 9. In October 2003, additional contributions of $191,825 were received in the INSTRAW Trust Fund. Taking into account these contributions, the balance of the Trust Fund as at 31 December 2003 is currently projected at $735,600. However, only $4,788 was pledged to the Trust Fund at the United Nations pledging conference for development activities, and it is therefore not possible to provide a reliable estimate of 2004 income at this time. V. Activities by which proposals would be implemented 10. With due regard to the institutional and financial limitations placed upon the Institute, the following objectives and related activities have been formulated for 2004: (a) Establish a secure and sustainable financial base for INSTRAW and re-establish its visibility through the implementation of an intense fund-raising strategy. This would include undertaking intensive fund-raising endeavours with States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, foundations, private sources and other potential donors, forging key partnerships and undertaking collaborative activities with other organizations within and outside the United Nations system, and intensifying the INSTRAW presence at and contributions to relevant meetings and events at both the regional and international levels; (b) Increase the Institute's outreach by continuing to expand and enhance the functioning of the Gender Awareness Information and Networking System (GAINS), including further populating its global community of national focal points, regional nodes, research and training institutions and information and communication technologies specialists; (c) Build upon prior work of INSTRAW in the strategic areas of women and men building partnerships for gender equality, women and men in the information society and the impact of globalization on women. The research on emerging issues related to women's migration would be conducted and the results would be available electronically through GAINS services. VI. Administrative and financial arrangements and indication of additional requirements 11. It is assumed, on the basis of the financial period of the regular budget, that the period of one year indicated in paragraph 5 of draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36 would be from 1 January to 31 December 2004. It is also understood that the request to ensure that the Institute would have adequate resources to function for a period of one year implies the continuation of the core activities of the Institute, those resources being defined as the salaries of the four Professional and five General Service staff as well as related substantive and administrative non-post resource requirements. 12. The related requirements for 2004 are estimated at $970,300. This includes (a) $556,000 for nine current posts (1 D-2, 1 P-3, 2 P-2/1 and 5 General Service); (b) resource requirements for substantive activities, including general temporary assistance, consultancy and travel, estimated at $211,000; and (c) administrative resource requirements of $203,300, including general operating expenses, supplies and materials, equipment, etc. 13. It is anticipated that the estimated INSTRAW Trust Fund balance of $735,600 as at 31 December 2003, indicated in paragraph 9 above, would enable the Institute to continue its operations through September 2004. Accordingly, an additional amount of $234,700 would be required to maintain the Institute to the end of 2004. 14. It is not possible at this stage to determine whether the Institute would have adequate resources from voluntary contributions to function beyond September 2004. In the event that insufficient voluntary contributions are received prior to that date, the amount of up to $234,700 referred to above would have to be funded from the regular budget. 15. The programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 provides for no resources that would be made available for the support of INSTRAW operations in 2004. Any amount that the General Assembly may decide to allocate to enable the Institute to continue its operations beyond September 2004 would therefore need to be provided through an additional appropriation in the context of the operations of the contingency fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986. VII. Summary 16. Should the General Assembly adopt draft resolution A/C.3/58/L.36, the decision to continue to provide support to the Institute would, contingent upon the availability or otherwise of additional voluntary contributions to the INSTRAW Trust Fund, give rise to potential additional requirements of up to $234,700 for the biennium 2004-2005, over and above the regular budget resources proposed under section 9, Economic and social affairs, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2004-2005. The provision would represent a charge against the contingency fund and, as such, would need to be considered in the context of the review by the Fifth Committee of the consolidated statement of potential charges to the contingency fund before any increase in appropriations for the biennium 2004-2005 was approved.
