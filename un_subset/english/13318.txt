Letter dated 14 September 2000 from the Chargé d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council I have been instructed by my Government to advise that over 60,000 litres of sulphuric acid have been released into the Ibar River from a Trepca battery plant in Kosovska Mitrovica, Kosovo and Metohija, the autonomous province of the Yugoslav constituent Republic of Serbia, causing an ecological disaster of unforeseeable proportions. The disaster is illustrative of the tragic consequences of the seizure of Trepca by the Kosovo Force (KFOR) and the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) of which the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia warned the Security Council on a number of occasions. This all the more so as, in seizing Trepca, KFOR and UNMIK professed all along that they were guided exclusively by ecological reasons. However, by allowing the disaster to happen, the international presences have in fact shown utter lack of concern for the environment and for those for whose well-being they have purported to act, and demonstrated once again that, in collusion with ethnic Albanian separatists, their only concern is to destroy each and every economic establishment in Serbian territories and thus drive the remaining Serbs and other non-Albanians from Kosovo and Metohija altogether. In advising that the Yugoslav Government has requested the United Nations Environment Programme to help relieve the consequences of the disaster, I take the opportunity to reiterate the request of my Government that the Security Council enable the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its constituent Republic of Serbia to carry out their duties in the territory of Kosovo and Metohija under Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999 and to enjoin UNMIK to reinstate the Trepca management and employees, thus making it possible for the corporation to recommence normal work. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Vladislav Jovanovic Chargé d'affaires, a.i.
