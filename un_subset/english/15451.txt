Letter dated 7 February 2001 from the Permanent Representative of South Africa to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council In my capacity as Chair of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement, I have the honour to inform you that the Coordinating Bureau met on 6 February 2001 to consider the latest developments concerning the "Lockerbie" issue following the verdict by the Scottish Court sitting in the Netherlands. The Non-Aligned Movement has affirmed the positive actions and cooperation extended by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, without which the agreement among the three parties, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, with the involvement of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, would not have been possible. The Non-Aligned Movement further wishes to submit its satisfaction that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has fulfilled all of its commitments in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. Pursuant to the above, the Non-Aligned Movement has the honour, once again, to request that the Security Council urgently consider the adoption of a resolution on the immediate and complete lifting of the sanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. I should be grateful if the present letter could be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Dumisani S. Kumalo Ambassador Permanent Mission of the Republic of South Africa to the United Nations
