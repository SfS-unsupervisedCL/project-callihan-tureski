Letter dated 25 May 2006 from the Permanent Representative of Australia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council Further to my letter of 24 May 2006, I am writing to inform you that Australia has now responded positively to the formal written request of 24 May from the Timor-Leste leadership and has agreed to provide appropriate assistance to support that country's defence and security forces to re-establish and maintain public order. Given the ongoing deterioration of the security situation, particularly around Dili, Australia commenced deploying security forces on 25 May 2006. We are working closely with Timor-Leste authorities and coordinating our efforts with contributions from other invited Governments and with the United Nations, including on the ground in Timor-Leste. I have written in similar terms to the Secretary-General. I would be grateful if you would circulate the present letter as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Robert Hill
