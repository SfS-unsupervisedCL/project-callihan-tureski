Message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to the Governing Council of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme at its twentyfirst session This year marks a milestone in human history: for the first time, half of the world's people will be living in towns and cities. That percentage is projected to rise dramatically in the decades ahead, especially in the cities of the developing world. Urban poverty should be unacceptable in the new urban era. Yet this will also be the year in which the number of slum dwellers worldwide is forecast to reach 1 billion. As we continue our efforts to reform and revitalize the United Nations, one of our abiding priorities must be to alleviate poverty. More concerted international support is needed if we are to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of improving the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. Failure would risk massive social exclusion, with national and international repercussions. Another compelling reason to improve living conditions in our towns and cities is to reduce their impact on climate change. An estimated 75 per cent of global energy consumption occurs in cities, and 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions come from urban areas. It is no coincidence that climate change has become a leading concern as the world becomes predominantly urban. Moreover, the urban poor are most vulnerable to the natural disasters made more frequent by climate change patterns, since they tend to live in unsafe places that are typically prone to disaster. I saw some of this at first hand this past January, when I visited the sprawling Kibera slum in Nairobi. I witnessed the depth of urban poverty and heard about the complexities of addressing the challenges. Slum dwellers themselves have resources, but lack access to affordable credit systems. Municipalities have land, but no capital to invest. Banks have liquidity, but no mechanisms to lend to the poor. I had the clear sense that time is not on our side. I am very encouraged that the Governing Council of UN-Habitat is looking at these issues. I look forward to learning of the results of your discussions on a new Medium-term Strategic and Institutional Plan and on mechanisms such as the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation, for which new financial regulations and rules were promulgated last August. It is my hope that your efforts will strengthen UN-Habitat and enable it to work more effectively with your partners towards truly sustainable urbanization. Please accept my best wishes for the success of your important deliberations. Annex III Summaries of opening statements A. Statement by Ms. Anna Tibaijuka, Executive Director of UN-Habitat 1. Ms. Tibaijuka welcomed participants to Nairobi in her capacity as both Executive Director of UNHabitat and Director-General of the United Nations Office at Nairobi. In particular, she welcomed the presence at the meeting of Mr. Mwai Kibaki, the President of Kenya, which was testament to his continued support of the work of UNEP and UN-Habitat. She congratulated Mr. Achim Steiner on his appointment as Executive Director of UNEP, and noted with satisfaction that cooperation between UNEP and UN-Habitat had been further strengthened since his arrival. She also congratulated Ms. Inga Björk-Klevby on her appointment as Deputy Executive Director of UN-Habitat. 2. She drew attention to the collaboration between UN-Habitat and the Kenyan Government under the joint Kenya Slum Upgrading Programme, and welcomed the fact that matters of housing finance and slum upgrading were being mainstreamed into government budgets. She recalled the recent visit of Mr. Ban Ki Moon, the United Nations Secretary-General, to the Kibera slum in Nairobi, which had signalled his solidarity with the more than 750,000 people living there and his support for the work of UNHabitat. She pointed out that for the first time in history, in 2007 half of the world's population would be living in urban areas. Worryingly, the rate of slum formation was almost the same as that of urban growth, and the global number of slum-dwellers would reach one billion in 2007. 3. She drew attention also to the UN-Habitat Medium-term Strategic and Institutional Plan for the period 2008 - 2013, which had been formulated following an intensive process of consultations with member States and external partners. The Plan was designed to strengthen the role of UN-Habitat as a catalyst for the coordinated implementation of the Habitat Agenda and related Millennium Development Goals and was a package of strategic objectives and activities in support of the realization of the UNHabitat mission and vision. The Plan recognized that sustainable urbanization required a participatory process and therefore encouraged increased alliance-building with member States, other United Nations agencies, programmes and funds and international and domestic financial institutions. Another important element of the Plan was its call for the introduction of a revolving fund mechanism. 4. She congratulated Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain since 1971, on winning the 2006 Special Citation of the Habitat Scroll of Honour Award. His policies for delivering sustainable development by fighting poverty had resulted in improved living conditions for all and had been identified as an example of best practices in good urban governance. UNHabitat would be pleased to work with the Government of Bahrain in popularizing the approach and inviting others to emulate its good example. 5. Mr. Achim Steiner, Executive Director of UNEP, noted that for the first time in the history of humankind, the majority of people were living in urban environments that rose high and spread far and offered to many the often illusory hope of an escape from poverty. The theme of sustainable urbanization at the current session of the Governing Council was of great importance to UNEP. In the collaboration between the two sister organizations, UNEP and UN-Habitat had started looking carefully, in the context of the "One UN" initiative and being headquartered in the same location, at the link between the human condition and the sustainability of the planet. Fruits of their collaboration included a joint strategic framework which was under development and aimed to further institutionalize their cooperation and a Global Environment Outlook city environment report for Nairobi, the preliminary outcomes of which would be launched during the current session, providing an excellent example of collaboration between the United Nations and a local authority. 6. The link between sustainable development and the environment was, at last, being recognized although climate change was still seen as a distraction from basic needs. He stressed the importance of understanding the relationship between the environment and urbanization, noting that, for example, over 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions originated from urban centres. Choices made in the present day on issues such as urban planning, transport and social inequity would lock generations of people into the results of those choices. It was necessary, therefore, to seek to liberate future generations through appropriate choices for and effective management of urban areas in the present day. 7. He pointed to the need to revitalize the United Nations family with a sense of common purpose and stressed that the Governing Councils of UNEP and UN-Habitat should serve as the ultimate platform to address their common predicaments. He underlined the importance of realizing that decisions taken in cities affected people beyond city borders. The ecological footprints of urban areas were a challenge as well as an opportunity for planners, people and ecosystems and it was important to look at urbanization in the urban - rural context. There was a need for new and innovative technology in addressing the challenges of urbanization. He wished representatives a successful and productive session and stressed the commitment of both UNEP and UN-Habitat to their continued and future collaboration. 8. Mr. Fahmi Al Jowder, Minister of Works and Housing of Bahrain, thanked Kenya for the reception accorded to his delegation and conveyed greetings from the Prime Minister and people of the Kingdom of Bahrain. He read out a message on behalf of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa, Prime Minister of Bahrain, in which the Prime Minister expressed appreciation to UNHabitat for awarding him the 2006 Special Citation of the Habitat Scroll of Honour Award. Over 35 years of premiership, he had focused on economic and development programmes to eliminate the root causes of poverty through cooperation with the people. The UNHabitat Special Citation was a gratifying and welcome indication that those efforts had been made in the right direction. Bahrain would be an interested and active participant in the Governing Council session and had valuable experience to share on policies on shelter, social development and good urban governance, which were all essential for achieving development goals. Bahrain had considerable experience in, among other things, housing finance systems. Sheikh Khalifa believed that UNHabitat was equal to the challenge of providing equitable shelter for all and that the current session would result in solutions to the challenges which the world faced in that area. D. Statement by Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of Kenya 9. President Kibaki welcomed participants to the session, expressing pleasure that the theme was sustainable urbanization with a focus on local action and that the emphasis would be on finance and planning, which were crucial to the sustainable development of urban centres, where inadequate financing and capacity over the years were the greatest challenges to effective action. The special theme also recognized that the world was rapidly urbanizing, with urban populations growing rapidly as the young migrated to towns and cities. Given the high rate of population movement, the world's largest cities were to be found in developing countries. The challenge was to manage that growth sustainably and tackle the problems of affordable and adequate housing. Informal settlements were spreading without planning and lacked proper sanitation, basic facilities and social infrastructure such as schools and policing and had limited employment opportunities. The cumulative effect of those negative factors was that migrants from rural areas experienced even greater deprivation than they had faced before they had migrated and were more vulnerable to crime and insecurity, resulting in an enduring urban underclass with all its attendant problems. 10. Sustainable urbanization included the ability of local authorities to provide adequate services. The lack of clean water, effective solid waste management and sanitation, affordable housing schemes and efficient mass transportation systems was often attributed to weak and poorly financed local governments. Central governments were often forced to intervene, but the measures they took were only temporary and did not afford lasting solutions. City dwellers themselves must be involved in addressing those issues and ensuring that local authorities were held accountable by residents and business communities. Strong and effective partnerships must be developed between local governments, residents and the business community, and urban authorities needed to develop reliable sources of revenue and to attract and retain highly qualified staff to plan the future needs of urban centres. 11. He outlined some of the measures being taken in Kenya to address the challenges of urbanization and ensure that it was managed in a sustainable way. The Government, jointly with UNHabitat and other partners, had initiated a number of measures to ensure sustainable urbanization, notably the Kenya Slum Upgrading Programme, which envisaged an improvement in the livelihoods of 5.4 million people in urban centres throughout the country at a cost of over $12 billion over 13 years. The Government had established a Low-cost Housing and Infrastructure Fund to pool resources from the Government and the private sector. The Government had contributed $7 million annually over the past two financial years and would double that amount in the coming year. Work was under way on 600 housing units in Nairobi's slum area of Kibera, water and sanitation was being upgraded at Soweto Village in Nairobi, and similar work was going on in Mombasa and Kisumu. Kenya's slum upgrading strategy also spelled out measures to be undertaken to prevent the development of new slums, which required an urban planning strategy. A draft sessional paper on land policy was being submitted to Parliament during its current session. The Government recognized that local authorities had a central role to play and had taken measures to enable the consultation and participation of local people in setting development priorities and in budgetary processes. 12. He expressed the hope that the exchange of ideas and best practices at the current session of the Governing Council would contribute to improving responses to the rapid urbanization across the world and acknowledged the support of UNEP and UN-Habitat to that end. He thanked the United Nations for elevating the Nairobi office to the level of other United Nations offices and welcomed the SecretaryGeneral's decision to support UN-Habitat in the assistance it was giving in the upgrading of Kibera slum. Annex IV Panel discussion: financing affordable housing and infrastructure in a reformed United Nations 1. Introducing the panel, the Chair, Ms. Björk-Klevby, Deputy Executive Director of UN-Habitat, noted that financing was an important theme at the twenty-first session. The Medium-term Strategic and Institutional Plan called for ongoing and increasing alliance-building with all those partners that were committed to making a difference, including financial institutions. The General Assembly had requested the Governing Council to revitalize the Foundation, including through the involvement of domestic actors, and the organization had embarked on strategic partnerships in that regard. Finance and development partners were seeking innovative collaboration in the pursuit of poverty reduction. Panellists had been invited to speak on collaborative and innovative efforts in this area to provide input for deliberations to be held during the session. 2. Mr. Mandla Gantsho, Vice-President of the African Development Bank, noted that in the development finance fraternity it had long been established that the foundation for poverty reduction and economic growth was the development of infrastructure. Priority areas where investment was needed were shelter and housing, job creation, education, health, safety and security and cultural development. The role of financial and development institutions was threefold - in catalytic financing, partnership development and knowledge-broking. The knowledge of the African Development Bank and its partners should be used to strengthen the hand of Governments in capacity-building. Partnerships should be mobilized to improve the spread of risks among the relevant partners, to involve communities and harmonize interventions. Innovative responses were needed in the design and monitoring of solutions and in giving access to financing to the poor. It was necessary to understand the priorities of the poor, such as gainful employment, and to address them so that the poor could then solve the issue of shelter and housing for themselves. Local capital markets should be developed and partnerships promoted to create employment, and housing construction should make use of local and indigenous materials. 3. Mr. Woochong Um, Director, Asian Development Bank, said that although the Bank's areas of focus had shifted over the years, its overarching objective had always been poverty reduction. In 2002 it had developed a revised poverty reduction strategy, with the main objectives of catalysing investment for urban infrastructure development. The Bank had adopted a long-term strategic and programming approach to its activities, and innovations included local-currency financing and sub-sovereign lending. The Bank attached great importance to the formation of effective partnerships. Accordingly, the Asian Development Bank had been collaborating with UN-Habitat in a number of areas, particularly through the Water and Sanitation Trust Fund and on the Water for Asian Cities programme. The Asian Development Bank was involved with the Asia-Pacific Water Forum in the organization of the first Asia-Pacific Water Summit, to be held in Japan in December 2007. 4. Mr. Larry Hannah, Lead Economist for the Europe and Central Asia region, World Bank, focused on the history of collaboration between the World Bank and UN-Habitat, the trends affecting the agenda established for the twenty-first session and how they had influenced the work of the Bank and financing affordable housing and infrastructure. The World Bank had started work on sustainable urbanization in the early 1970s and had initiated its collaboration with UN-Habitat - a relationship based on complementarity rather than competition - in the mid-1980s, including through the Water and Sanitation Trust Fund, the Urban Management Programme, the Housing Indicators Programme and, perhaps most successfully, their joint sponsorship of the Cities Alliance. The profile of urban issues had been raised throughout the work of the World Bank. The Bank had started to examine the role of cities and local authorities in climate change. He described crucial aspects in addressing the financing of affordable housing - property rights, the financial sector, local government and housing policy - and stressed the importance of collaboration both within organizations and on the national and international levels. 5. Mr. Kibby Kirithi, Founding Director of Baraka Africa Equity Fund, Kenya, said that in his experience the main obstacle to affordable housing in Kenya was not a lack of domestic capital, but rather a shortage of housing supply. The challenge faced was to mobilize the available domestic capital markets for social investments and encourage developers to turn their attention to affordable housing. Stressing the importance of government involvement, for example through offering price incentives for the provision of affordable housing, he acknowledged the Kenyan Government's receptiveness in that regard. UN-Habitat had played a leading role in terms of facilitation and innovation and was one of the Equity Fund's key partners in that area. 6. Mr. Achim Steiner, Executive Director of UNEP, noted that much current urban development, particularly in developing countries, was taking place at a suboptimal level. The housing market, although often vibrant, was greatly lacking at the level of pro-poor affordable housing and there was a need to focus on policy and market failures to address the fact that institutional and sectoral policies had compartmentalized approaches that should rather be integrated. Despite the long-standing relationships between international financial institutions and the United Nations, their collaboration had often been inadequate. There was a need for complementary partnerships between institutions, Governments, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and private capital markets, among others, to address the issues of poverty and environmental sustainability. The way that environmental sustainability had been factored into urban development had been far from effective. Current policy advice for urban development was deficient in addressing the social and environmental dimensions. It was important to look at urban infrastructure development from the perspective of the poor. There were numerous poverty-oriented solutions, such as pedestrian paths and bicycle lanes on new dual carriageways or rainwater harvesting and energy efficiency for low-cost housing, which were simple and cheap and would greatly benefit the poor. Annex V Policy statement by Ms. Anna Tibaijuka, Executive Director of UN-Habitat, on agenda items 5, 6 and 8 1. Ms. Tibaijuka said that, in formulating the proposed programme and organization of work, efforts had been made to ensure a judicious balance between dialogue and decision-making. Three key substantive issues were on the agenda: the special theme of the current session of the Governing Council; the Mediumterm Strategic and Institutional Plan for 2008 - 2013; and the 2008 - 2009 work programme and budget. 2. The special theme - Dialogue on sustainable urbanization: local action for urban poverty reduction with an emphasis on finance and planning - was a direct outcome of the third session of the World Urban Forum, held in Vancouver, Canada in June 2006. The theme paper before the Council gave an overview of current thinking and practice in participatory planning and human settlements finance. Innovative measures were needed to involve a wide range of actors in planning and investment to create value out of urban space. 3. The Medium-term Strategic and Institutional Plan had three components: a strategic component, an institutional component and a resource mobilization strategy. The UN-Habitat vision - "Sustainable urbanization through the Habitat Agenda" - was now well articulated in the plan. Drawing particular attention to the focus on innovative human settlements finance, she said that the proposed revision of operational procedures and guidelines had the potential to bridge the undeniable gap that existed in affordable housing and basic services for the poor through a more sustainable approach to financing. The plan contributed to United Nations system-wide institutional reform and coherence through its focus on results-based management and accountability. 4. As regards the resource mobilization strategy component of the plan, she thanked the donors who had made possible the fivefold increase in funding since UN-Habitat had become a Programme in 2002, though continuing weaknesses included the imbalance between earmarked and non-earmarked contributions and the unpredictability of funding. The strategy sought to address those problems by consolidating the current funding base, working towards a voluntary scale of assessed contributions and adopting a more robust communication strategy to enhance further the visibility of UN-Habitat. 5. A key activity under focus area 3 of the plan would be a campaign to promote national- and citylevel action plans for the construction of decent affordable homes in all applicable countries. The campaign would engage partners, including the private sector, to mobilize funding to construct affordable housing at a rate that would close the gap in housing stock by 10 per cent a year between 2008 and 2013. As a first step, it was important for governments to mainstream pro-poor urban development in their national development plans and budgets. Where political will was shown, UNHabitat would bring its expertise in community organization, capacity-building and policy advice. 6. The land issue was central to the instability and slow economic growth being experienced in many cities. To help address the complex dimensions of that issue, the UN-Habitat Global Land Tool Network needed to be further mainstreamed. She called upon member States to ensure that security of tenure was not denied to women through discriminatory inheritance rules. She also highlighted the vulnerability of the urban poor to climate change, and said that UN-Habitat would work closely with UNEP to build capacity for local action in that area. In the 2008 - 2009 work programme and budget, an increase of $15 million was required to kickstart the implementation of the Medium-term Strategic and Institutional Plan. It was time for UNHabitat to invest in its systems so that it could operate with full effectiveness and efficiency. 8. She stressed, however, that the theme, plan, work programme and budget were not ends in themselves but starting points on a path towards a more focused, coherent and aligned UN-Habitat. Annex VI Summaries by the President of the Governing Council of the highlevel segment and of the dialogue on the special theme of the twentyfirst session 1. The high-level segment of the twenty-first session of the Governing Council of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme comprised four plenary meetings, held on 16, 17 and 18 April 2007. Discussions focused on the following issues: activities of UN-Habitat, including coordination matters (agenda item 5); dialogue on the special theme for the twenty-first session of the Governing Council (agenda item 6); and the Medium-term Strategic and Institutional Plan for UNHabitat for the period 20082013 (agenda item 8). 2. Many representatives expressed their deep appreciation to the Government and the people of Kenya for their hospitality in hosting the twenty-first session. Most representatives who spoke congratulated the President of the twenty-first session and the members of the Bureau on their election. Many representatives congratulated the Executive Director on her re-appointment as Executive Director of UN-Habitat and her appointment as Director-General of the United Nations Office at Nairobi and expressed their gratitude to her for her comprehensive policy statement. A number of representatives from developing countries expressed thanks for the support provided to their delegations to attend the twenty-first session of the Governing Council, and many described areas of collaboration with UNHabitat in their countries and expressed their gratitude to the Executive Director and to her organization as a whole, including for the preparatory work for the current session of the Governing Council. 3. The representative of Sri Lanka thanked the Executive Director for her personal interest in his country's post-tsunami rehabilitation. The representative of Indonesia also expressed appreciation to UNHabitat, donor countries and other international organizations for supporting the rehabilitation and reconstruction process in his country. The representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo invited the Executive Director to visit his country to experience at first hand the urgency of the need for reconstruction. He also requested the support of UNHabitat for his country's programme of demilitarization, demobilization and social reintegration currently being implemented, and for which housing would be required. 4. In that connection, a number of representatives drew attention to the need for further UNHabitat involvement in addressing the challenge of developing sustainable human settlements in conflictaffected areas. 5. A number of representatives spoke of a new urban era in which half of humanity was living in urban areas and where informal settlements constituted the fastest-growing neighbourhoods of those cities and towns; an urbanized world, they said, implied both opportunities and challenges. 6. Several representatives noted the clear central responsibility of local and national governments to tackle the challenges of urbanization and stressed the importance of local and national Governments working together to meet local needs while delivering on national priorities. In that context, a representative of United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) underlined the importance of adopting the draft guidelines on decentralization and the strengthening of local governments. 7. Several representatives emphasized the need to fulfil the commitments and targets agreed upon by the international community as a whole, including those related to adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world. In that regard, several representatives called for the strengthening of the United Nations Habitat and Human Settlements Foundation. The representative of the European Union, however, urged that any strengthening of the Foundation should correspond to the role of the organization within the international aid architecture. Several representatives expressed support for the strengthening of the United Nations Office at Nairobi as the headquarters of UN-Habitat and UNEP and the only United Nations headquarters located in a developing country. A number of representatives stressed the importance of partnership as a leading principle in the work of UNHabitat and highlighted the importance of coordination at the national, regional and international levels. They called for more effective and broader involvement of UN-Habitat partners, especially the private and public sectors, and more effective cooperation and coordination between UNHabitat and other relevant United Nations agencies, including UNEP. One representative said that his Government actively supported UN-Habitat activities on issues relating to the social development of Arctic human settlements and stressed the need to improve cooperation with other organizations in that area, particularly UNEP and the Arctic Council. Another representative welcomed the increased cooperation between UNEP and UN-Habitat but said that it should also include closer interaction between the Committees of Permanent Representatives of the two organizations. One representative noted the need to bring UN-Habitat closer to localities by strengthening its cooperation with countries. One representative of a small island developing State expressed the hope that small island developing States would be mainstreamed in UN-Habitat projects and programmes and that one of the outcomes of the current session would be a commitment to continued support for the sustainable development of human settlements in such island States so as to ensure the implementation of those elements of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States which pertained to human settlements. Many representatives welcomed the focus at the current session on the theme of sustainable urbanization: local action for urban poverty reduction, with emphasis on finance and planning. In that connection, support was expressed for the Executive Director's initiative to designate an international day for affordable housing. One representative, also expressing support for the Executive Director's initiative, announced that he would consult his Government on the possibility of holding such a day in his country. The ministers of housing of India and the Islamic Republic of Iran drew attention to the first AsiaPacific Ministerial Conference on Housing and Human Settlements, which had been held in New Delhi from 13 to 16 December 2006 in cooperation with UN-Habitat, and at which the Islamic Republic of Iran had been selected to host the second such conference, which would be held in Tehran in 2008. A number or representatives expressed their support for the work programme and budget of UNHabitat for the 2008 - 2009 biennium and also welcomed the Medium-term Strategic and Institutional Plan for 20082013 as the basis for strengthening UN-Habitat and as a significant milestone for the organization. Its specific focus areas were a positive development which would help to target the activities of the organization further. One representative welcomed in particular the strategic focus on the areas of effective advocacy, promotion of pro-poor land and housing policies and environmentally sound urban infrastructure. A number of representatives noted that a strong Medium-term Plan would be crucial to ensuring a sharpened programmatic approach and to broadening the funding base of UN-Habitat and concluded that the Governing Council at its twentyfirst session should therefore support the provision of the additional resources required for the 2008 - 2009 biennium to ensure meaningful delivery of the Medium-term Plan. In connection with the Plan, one representative stressed the importance of strengthening the pre-investment role of UN-Habitat. One speaker commended the Plan's focus on data and measurable results, which would lead to greater transparency. Another representative said, however, that the crucial role of women in local communities had not been adequately reflected in the plan. One representative, although expressing his overall support for the Plan, requested more information on, among other things, the ratio of resources to be allocated between the normative role and the operational activities of UNHabitat; whether the Executive Director planned to establish an efficiency agenda for running costs and how efficiency targets would be realized and progress measured; how and when resultsbased management would be implemented; which partners UN-Habitat proposed to work with and clear arrangements for greater operational synergies. In addition, he suggested that further analysis and consultation was required before determining the nature of the role of UNHabitat in financing. A number of representatives suggested that securing predictable and adequate funding for UNHabitat, including for the Medium-term Plan, should be based on a multi-year financing framework. One representative noted the need for mechanisms to be developed to reduce the reliance of the organization on unpredictable voluntary contributions and proposed, to that end, that States should consider maintaining or increasing their contributions and adopting multi-year pledges or contributions. In that regard, the representative of Norway said that her Government intended to increase its non-earmarked contribution for 2007 and 2008 from 15 to 25 million kroner, i.e., to the annual equivalent of over $4 million. The representative of Kenya announced that his country had pledged to increase its contribution from the current $50,000 to $60,000, starting in 2007 - 2008, for the following three years. The representative of Rwanda announced his Government's pledge to increase its annual contribution to $5,000, although its assessed contribution was only $400. The representative of the Russian Federation also announced an increase in his country's annual contribution, from $200,000 to $400,000, starting in 2007. One representative expressed concern, however, that a large percentage of the UN-Habitat budget was allocated to consultancy work and workshops, leaving little for tangible projects that reached the targeted poor communities, and urged the Executive Director to monitor spending and ensure that funds were used for the benefit of the targeted countries and end users. He also noted with concern the increasing tendency of United Nations agencies to base their decisions on the allocation of resources to member States on political criteria. With respect to the innovative funding mechanism, the Revolving Fund Account, enabled through the new rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary-General, support was expressed by the representative of the Group of 77 and China for the initiation of an experimental, phased approach for Revolving Fund Account schemes at the country level. A number of other representatives also expressed support for the Account and proposed the establishment of an African fund for slum prevention and upgrading within UNHabitat to catalyse increased official development assistance. One representative, noting that his Government had strong reservations with regard to the voluntary indicative scale of contributions, said that further clarification would be required before any decision could be made on the Revolving Fund Account. Another representative cautioned against proceeding too quickly with the launch of the revolving fund mechanism, and suggested that all alternatives should be investigated before the twenty-second session of the Governing Council, when the issue could be reconsidered. One representative supported testing the proposed experimental reimbursable seed-capital operations under the Slum Upgrading Facility and the Water and Sanitation Trust Fund. Several representatives spoke in favour of the new enhanced normative and operational framework of UNHabitat which, they said, was a necessary step forward for the attainment of UNHabitat goals. The representative of the European Union stressed, however, that any envisaged expansion should be set against a backdrop of the catalytic role played by the organization, its comparative advantages, limited resources and institutional capacity compared with other agencies and institutions. One representative stressed that the role of UNHabitat in the area of human settlements was first and foremost a normative one and that the organization was well suited to help establish best practices and to provide a forum for dialogue and expertise. He also emphasized the organization's role in serving as a catalyst for action at the local level by providing technical advice and knowledge management. Another speaker urged UN-Habitat to focus more narrowly on consolidating its core programmes rather than on too many and too varied programmes. Several representatives supported strengthening the capacity of the regional offices of UNHabitat. One representative stressed the importance of expanding the regional strategies of UNHabitat and developing both its regional and its national representation. In that connection, one representative welcomed the recent establishment of a Regional Office in his country. The representative of the European Union noted that the activities of UN-Habitat should be seen and developed against the background of ongoing United Nations system-wide reform. Another representative encouraged UN-Habitat to actively engage in the "One UN" pilot programmes to learn lessons and find synergies with local organizations, other United Nations agencies, donors and nongovernmental organizations. One representative expressed support for the recommendations of the United Nations Secretary-General's Highlevel Panel on United Nations System-wide Coherence and expressed the hope that UN-Habitat would be a strong contributor to the United Nations reform process, and another noted that the Mediumterm Strategic and Institutional Plan could assist the United Nations reform process by highlighting the importance of cross-cutting issues in the "One UN" country programmes. Several representatives commended the World Urban Forum as a constructive venue for the exchange of information and best practices. One representative noted that the World Urban Forum had made a significant contribution to mainstreaming the urban agenda and had a significant role to play in strengthening coordination of international support to implementation of the Habitat Agenda. Another representative expressed support for the establishment of a World Urban Forum Unit in the Office of the Executive Director. One representative pointed to the increasing impact of climate change, an issue of particular significance in the urban context, on the international agenda: cities were both originators and victims of climate change. Another representative stressed the importance of cities diminishing their burden on the environment by limiting energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. One representative said that closer attention should be paid to the dynamics of climate change and urbanization, particularly with regard to disaster risk management. The representative of Kenya proposed that the Governing Council at its twenty-first session should allocate a significant amount of the resources of the Foundation and/or the Slum Upgrading Facility for the provision of infrastructure in Kibera in Nairobi, reportedly the largest slum in Africa; further, it should establish a mortgage credit system and a business support system through cooperatives, microfinance institution systems and local service providers to scale up efforts to improve housing, water and sanitation in that informal settlement. Also on the question of slum upgrading, several representatives expressed their support for the proposed draft resolution to establish an Africa Fund/Finance Mechanism to address the slum target of the Millennium Development Goals in Africa. One representative expressed support for the immediate formulation and implementation of the sustainable reconstruction and recovery strategy for displaced and vulnerable populations, focusing on persons affected by earthquakes and floods, and welcomed the establishment of the Central Emergency Relief Fund. Many representatives described initiatives in their countries to address the challenge of sustainable urbanization, including local-level planning, financial and legislative reforms; implementation of slum upgrading activities and affordable housing projects; promotion of the adaptation and use of appropriate building and construction materials and technologies; and job creation initiatives, among other things. Some representatives also mentioned that experiences in their countries could inform the development of UNHabitat programmes in others. In that connection, several representatives of developing countries sought the financial and technical support of UN-Habitat and development partners to assist in implementing their housing and urban development policies, and one representative called on African countries to increase regional capacity-building and exchange of experiences. Individual representatives expressed support for the implementation of the Bali Strategic Plan on Technology Support and Capacity-building as an opportunity for enhanced cooperation between UNEP and UN-Habitat. Other individual representatives expressed the following views: that the Habitat Programme Manager system had proved positive in enhancing the coherence and integration of UNHabitat issues into national development policies and other processes at the national level; that adequate resources, training and geographical balance were crucial; that UN-Habitat should support the activities of the African Ministerial Conference on Housing and Urban Development; that increased financial and technical assistance were crucial for developing countries; and that there was a need to define the role of UN-Habitat further in promoting a global, national and local perspective on urban development, building on and strengthening its core competencies. The Governing Council took up the agenda item on Wednesday, 18 April 2007, at its 5th and 6th plenary meetings. The theme of the dialogue was sustainable urbanization: local action for urban poverty reduction, with an emphasis on finance and planning. The President of the Governing Council, Ms. Kumari Selja, opened the dialogue and handed the conduct of the first two segments of the dialogue over to the facilitator, Ms. Christine Platt, President, Commonwealth Association of Planners. The special theme was divided into three segments. The role of planning in urban poverty reduction Ms. Platt explained that the dialogue would focus on the role of planning in urban poverty reduction and financing pro-poor housing and urban development. She introduced the panellists for the first segment - Ms. Åslaug Marie Haga, Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, Norway; Mr. Lu Bing, Deputy Mayor, City of Nanjing, China; Mr. Jean-Pierre Elong Mbassi, SecretaryGeneral, United Cities and Local Governments of Africa; and Mr. Wolfgang Frosch, Manager, BASF Social Foundation, Germany - and invited them to make brief presentations. Ms. Haga stressed that sustainable urbanization could not be achieved in the absence of strong local authorities, which implied strong political and administrative structures. Local authorities must be openminded and listen to the people whom they served, particularly the most vulnerable groups. It was a challenge for all countries to ensure both that the necessary formal structures for participation were in place and that dedicated citizens were involved. She pointed out that democracy was not only about participating in elections, but also about the period between elections. She pointed to the importance of having a clear division of labour between national, regional and local authorities, and the necessary financial resources being made available so that each level of government could fulfil the duties assigned to it. In that connection, she welcomed the fact that the draft guidelines on decentralization and the strengthening of local authorities were being presented for adoption by the Governing Council at the current session. Noting that the normative work carried out by UN-Habitat was an important first step in achieving sustainable urbanization, she concluded that it was now necessary to embark on implementation. Mr. Lu gave an overview of the measures adopted in Nanjing to address the challenges of rapid urbanization, which included large-scale housing construction, the introduction of various innovative financial mechanisms and subsidy schemes. Noting that the fourth session of the World Urban Forum was to be held in Nanjing in October 2008, he said he looked forward to further in-depth discussion on new models for urban development. Mr. Frosch outlined the measures employed by BASF to ensure environmental, social and economic sustainability in its main areas of activity, which included the production of materials for housing construction and housing development. He drew attention to the company's home-ownership scheme, which allowed employees to buy affordable housing units from the company. The company then reinvested the revenue in upgrading old buildings or building new ones. He stressed the importance of stakeholder participation, public-private partnerships and the provision of incentives to the private sector by government. UN-Habitat could play an active and central role in sustainable urbanization by acting as a best-practice platform for the exchange of innovative models and success stories and by developing a management toolbox for urbanization projects. Mr. Mbassi pointed to the difficulty of planning for many cities in developing countries whose populations doubled every 10 to 15 years. Planning systems had been unsuccessful in many cities in the developing world because they were based on experiences in developed countries and were therefore not adapted to local circumstances, most notably to the poorer sections of urban areas with lower levels of resources and institutional organization. He welcomed the fact that Governments had been invited at the third World Urban Forum to renew their planning tools and drew attention to six major challenges to be taken into account in so doing: urgency, investment, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, participation and capacity-building. Emphasizing the role of participation, he quoted the phrase "every thing you do to me, without me, is against me". In the ensuing discussion, a number of participants described the planning mechanisms in place in their countries and their experiences in collaborating with UN-Habitat in the area of planning. One representative stressed the importance of taking stock of planning tools and elaborating best practices. In response to the concern expressed by one participant that decentralization should be monitored to ensure that the desired results were achieved, Mr. Mbassi said that to that end his organization, in collaboration with UNHabitat, had developed a global observatory on local democracy. Other points raised included the need for a paradigm shift in the definition of development and the importance of reconsidering the purpose of planning systems for the twenty-first century, in the light of rapid urbanization, as it was now necessary to focus on such issues as reducing vulnerability to environmental disasters and ensuring environmental sustainability, and earlier planning objectives might no longer apply. It was noted that the current planning challenges were international but applied to individual countries in different ways. A number of speakers stressed the importance of capacity-building for all stakeholders in the planning process. Referring to the importance of ensuring that the experiences of the general population were taken into account in the planning process, one panellist stressed the need to listen particularly to women and young people. One representative of a developing country said that the problem facing some countries was not a lack of planning but rather the difficulty of accessing the financial resources necessary to implement plans. Financing pro-poor housing and urban development Ms. Platt introduced the panellists for the second segment, Ms. Barbra Kohlo, Regional Housing Advisor, Swedish Cooperative Centre and Mr. James Kinobe, Minister of State for Youth, Uganda. Ms. Kohlo noted that financing pro-poor housing and urban development was an ever more critical issue in the face of the rapid and chaotic urbanization taking place in developing countries and the growing number of the urban poor living in slums. The shortcomings of Governments in particular had contributed in various ways to the current challenges facing African countries. She highlighted the diverse means by which poor urban communities had organized themselves and stressed the importance of a participatory and consultative urban planning process. There was a need for donors to move away from oneoff projects to longerterm programmes that combined capacity-building and the provision of construction finance. The engagement of the State in the provision of housing finance to boost the inadequate savings of poor people was crucial and experiences from around the world should be documented with lessons learned and best practices elaborated for scaling up. UN-Habitat had a role to play in information exchange and scaling up successful urban experiences; assisting States in mobilizing funds and capacity-building; and forming strategic alliances. She stressed the central responsibility of government in addressing the challenges of urbanization: Governments should be compelled to uphold, protect and guarantee the rights of the urban poor through the creation of facilitative environments, open spaces for dialogue and participation in planning and decision-making, and through demonstrating political will and commitment to eradicating poverty. Mr. Kinobe highlighted the importance of identifying the role of young people and including a framework for their participation in finance and planning processes. An increasing number of young people made up a significant majority of people living in urban areas in developing countries. In Uganda, 76 per cent of the population were under 30 years old and many of them were homeless, unskilled, had no specific income and depended on insalubrious activities for their very survival. Young people had immense potential to contribute to social development, but their strengths needed to be harnessed with deliberate targets. He commended the drafting of a resolution on the establishment of a youth trust fund for possible adoption by the Governing Council at the current session. Nevertheless, he emphasized the importance of building capacity rather than creating further dependence on donor aid. In the discussion that ensued, a number of representatives elaborated on experiences in their countries. One successful model for replication was cited as Shack Dwellers Federation of Namibia, a group of lowincome women that raised funds to finance the building of houses. The Government of that country allocated funds for the community-based organization in its national budget; also, the group's work had expanded from urban to rural areas and included cooperation with international nongovernmental organizations. A number of representatives pointed to the importance of the sharing of experiences and, in that regard, supported the proposal for a dialogue on microfinancing, building on experiences and lessons learned, to be held at the fourth World Urban Forum. A number of representatives called for more emphasis on communityprivate and community-public partnerships. Other issues raised by representatives included the central responsibility of national Governments in financing pro-poor housing; the importance of focusing on what the people could contribute to the process; the need to address all sections of the population in budgeting, planning and development without marginalizing the poor; that one of the biggest obstacles to financing propoor housing was the lack of municipal finance for basic infrastructures and services; the need for more information on ways of mobilizing private-sector involvement; the importance of involving decisionmakers in planning and exploiting synergies between ministries and levels of government; and the contradictions that could arise as a result of the proliferation of planning policies. Summarizing the discussion, the facilitator stressed the interdependence of all people and elaborated on the challenges highlighted at the third World Urban Forum, noting the need for sustainable planning system tools and frameworks with clear roles for implementing agencies; linkages between planning and investment for improved local action; public-private partnerships using appropriate models; adequate funding of planning mandates; integrated planning, including gender, youth and urban poor issues and participatory approaches focused on achievable outcomes; effective planning for sustainable urbanization and sustainable development; and partnerships for capacitybuilding for planning and local administration, including financial management. In that connection, she reminded participants in the dialogue that a dialogue session on housing finance was to be held at the fourth World Urban Forum. Towards an agenda for local action for poverty reduction The Vice-President of the Governing Council, Mr. Michael Werikhe, introduced the facilitator, Mr. Willem van Vliet - of the University of Colorado and invited the panellists, Mr. Luiz Carlos Fabbri, Ministry of Cities (Housing and Urban Development), Brazil; Mr. José Cuervo, Vice-Mayor of Barcelona, Spain; Mr. Smangaliso Mkhatshwa (UCLG) former Mayor of Tshwane, South Africa; Mr. Eloy Cantú Segovia, President, Global Parliamentarians on Habitat, Mexico; Ms. Maria Teresa Rodriguez, Women and Peace Network, Guatemala; Ms. Rose Molokoane, Slum Dwellers International, South Africa; Mr. Laxman Perera, Ministry of Urban Development and Water Supply, Sri Lanka; and Mr. Aduragbemi Ogunbanke, Young Entrepreneurs in Africa, to make their presentations. Mr. Fabbri pointed out that housing and urban development funding for the poor constituted a major challenge for all since the construction of sustainable cities required sizeable investments in urban infrastructure. The Government of Brazil was making efforts to address the housing shortage by undertaking major public investments and focusing on areas with the highest concentrations of urban poverty. Through its pilot investment plan, the Government had freed a number of programmes from fiscal restrictions so as to be able to address the needs of low-income households better through publicfunded actions. The pilot investment plan included resources for the improvement of slums equivalent to $4 billion and another $4 billion for public sanitation works for low-income populations. He emphasized the essential role which the State must play in granting benefits to poor populations in Brazilian cities, as an agent and inducer of investment. Mr. Cuervo said that the growth of urbanization throughout the world and the movement of populations to urban centres constituted a challenge. Cities should be spaces for all, and globalization meant that solutions must be found for different types of inequalities in cities. Barcelona had tried to open doors to people from all strata of society, but over the past few years globalization had been beneficial to some but not to others; thus, there was a need for new thinking and new concepts. In Barcelona, the local government encouraged companies to invest in the city, where there were many investment opportunities. Also, cooperation between the public and the private sectors, though desirable, was not easy: the private sector was interested in profits, stability was required for investments to yield returns, so there was resistance to change. Nevertheless, the private sector should be involved in solving the problem of exclusion. The local government also worked with citizen groups, and was working also in collaboration with UN-Habitat and UNEP on the issue of poverty reduction. Mr. Mkhatshwa said that in South Africa and elsewhere local authorities were committed to rural areas because they felt that it was necessary to maintain a balance in development between rural and urban areas. There was an implicit recognition in the theme of the current session, however, that urbanization throughout the world was inexorable and that it often led to the development of slums. The lesson for political leaders was that there was a need for more investment in early-warning systems for migration to urban areas. With regard to localizing Agenda 21, there was a need to decentralize to local governments and to involve local communities in issues. There was also a need to include civil society and target participation on the part of groups such as women and youth. For local action, it was important to empower local authorities. Mr. Segovia pointed out that it was the task of parliamentarians to translate the proposals made by UN-Habitat into action. Parliamentarians were the ones that could pass legislation that favoured the poor. At the international level, they developed and reviewed treaties. They participated in forums discussing themes relating to the work of UN-Habitat. Global Parliamentarians on Habitat had held meetings in many countries, which had given them experience that could be applied to any country on a case-by-case basis. He stressed that cities needed not just housing but quality housing, and lamented the fact that Governments normally did not allocate adequate financial resources to local governments: cities should be in a position to provide quality services to their residents. The Global Parliamentarians were therefore advocating the decentralization of planning, and were also committed to competitiveness, which promoted economic growth. Ms. Rodriguez said that the Women and Peace Network was working on the reconstruction of countries emerging from armed conflict, but even elsewhere there was a need to address extreme poverty. Through discrimination, women, for example, were impoverished even if they were wealthy. There was a need to empower women socially, economically and politically. International organizations must give assistance to grassroots women so that they could participate in decision-making and they must facilitate genuine participation of women in economic development. However, for there to be economic growth there must be security: women must have the right to own land with security of tenure, the right to live in cities without violence, and the right to participate in decision-making processes. Ms. Molokoane said that Slum Dwellers International already had a poverty reduction agenda and that land, housing and collaboration were issues that were being addressed. Slum Dwellers International had realized that small savings could attract more resources if used creatively. The organization was calling on Governments, international organizations and the United Nations for assistance. It had already built a university for slum dwellers in India. It was convinced that eviction was not a solution to the problems of slums, and so it had created partnership with Governments and was trying to convince them that slum dwellers might be poor but they were not hopeless. Slum Dwellers International had an exchange programme that enabled the exchange of views and experiences between countries, and she had come to the conclusion that there was a need to extend public-private partnership to include communities. Slum dwellers and communities needed the political will of leaders and they wanted to be considered as partners for, after all, grassroots input into national policies was a necessity. Mr. Perera said that there was a need to determine what changes were required at the city and country level to support local action. Because most local authorities were not able to work with communities, there was a need to develop partnerships. Mr. Ogunbanke pointed out that young people, who constituted 70 per cent of the population in some developing countries, were the most affected by poverty, unemployment and unsustainable urban development. With the current mass urbanization, urgent action was necessary, and young people possessed immense potential to contribute to social development if given the right opportunities. He appealed to the private sector to give young people opportunities by creating employment, investing in slums and investing in slum upgrading in a profitable manner. Governments should support youth initiatives and the international community, particularly United Nations agencies, should recognize that young people constituted a strong force that could be harnessed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. He commended UNHabitat on its activities as they related to young people, including the Global Partnership Initiative, which had included the creation of "One Stop Youth Centres". Following the presentations of the panellists, the facilitator requested discussion points from participants on the main theme, "An agenda for local action for poverty reduction". During the first round of the discussion, several participants spoke of the need for increased decentralization of decision-making, while noting that it implied capacity-building, training and finance to raise the capabilities of local actors. One participant said that decentralization did not run counter to the affairs of the State but rather had the potential to reinforce the State by promoting democratic ideals. A main theme raised in the discussion was the need for increased promotion of private-public partnerships while accommodating other diverse stakeholders within local communities. One participant said that the market-centred ideology was increasingly taken for granted in intergovernmental discourse and that a more social, people-centred perspective, including community-private and community-public partnerships, was required in order to achieve social justice and well-being for the marginalized. The facilitator asked the panellists to respond particularly to the issue of how to ensure that decentralization was inclusive. Mr. Cuervo pointed to the need to find a compromise between the various stakeholders at the local level. The community, government and the private sector all had their roles to play, requiring a balance between local opinion, social welfare and profit when formulating urban projects. It was important to work productively with non-governmental organizations. Quoting the example of South Africa, Mr. Mkhatshwa spoke of the need for a national governance structure that allowed federal, provincial and local spheres to participate equally in decision-making processes. Ms. Rodriguez said it was important to ensure that appropriate mechanisms were in place whereby women had equal rights to land tenure and ownership; the current disempowerment of women left them vulnerable to the adverse effects of corruption, violence and other social ills. Ms. Molokoane said that effective programmes for change required recognition and support at all levels if they were to be properly integrated into development planning. Mr. Fabbri observed that it was difficult for local governments to set up public-private partnerships, and decentralization was therefore not just an administrative process but one that involved improved efficiency and a broadening of political participation. During the second round of the discussion, a number of further themes were raised. Several participants spoke of the negative effects of terrorism, war and violence, including forced migration and pressure on the resources of urban centres, causing particular hardship for vulnerable sectors of society, including the young and the elderly. One participant said that, in designing actionable ideas, the issue of HIV/AIDS should be given due attention. Others highlighted the need to facilitate the movement of finance to those areas where it was most needed, with some drawing attention to the value of fund creation for particular projects at local level while warning of the susceptibility of such funds to "leakage" because of corruption and spending on marginal activities such as workshops, weakening their impact on the ground. Corruption was seen as a threat to the decentralization of financial responsibilities, and improved systems for ensuring transparency were needed. The facilitator asked for responses from the panellists, focusing particularly on the issues of security and accountability. Mr. Fabbri said that it was important to develop local security systems that enabled citizens to benefit from their right to enjoy the positive dimensions of city dwelling. Ms. Molokoane said there was a link between personal security and security of tenure: ownership of land encouraged more settled occupation, a demand for education and other basic facilities, employment opportunities and a spirit of citizenship, while discouraging urban violence, vandalism and corruption. Mr. Segovia said that, in South America as elsewhere, much urban violence stemmed from organized crime, which required international cooperation and law enforcement training if it was to be combated. The facilitator pointed out that the upcoming UN-Habitat Global Report on Human Settlements 2007 dealt with many of the issues raised in the discussion. 56. The panellists were invited to make concluding remarks. Ms. Rodriguez, noting that the mid term of the schedule for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals was approaching, said that radical political decisions and innovative solutions were required if they were to be achieved. Mr. Cuervo reaffirmed his confidence that cities could be public spheres that were accommodating and inclusive while offering opportunities for personal advancement. Ms. Molokoane re-emphasized the importance of extending public-private partnership to embrace community representatives and of Governments providing local communities with the resources to construct their own houses. Mr. Perera said that alleviation of local poverty required the mobilization of local resources and the inclusion of the local community in all actions. Continuing the theme, Mr. Fabbri said that, in order to be effective, local action to combat poverty required integration of political, social and economic spheres and their representatives. Mr. Mkhatshwa noted that while forums such as the current dialogue were useful for generating guidelines and principles, there was a need for more effective action on the ground. Mr. Segovia observed that politics was the art of making the desired possible and that strong legislative frameworks were a basis for achieving that result. Mr. Ogunbanke said that the energy of young people, too often wasted by exploitative practices, had great potential as a force for poverty reduction. Closing the dialogue, the facilitator pointed to the importance of knowledge as a guide to action: research and informationgathering were effective tools in formulating plans of action and advocating change as a means of achieving the larger goals of social justice and social inclusion.
