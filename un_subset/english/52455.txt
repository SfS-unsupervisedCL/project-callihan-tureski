Sixty-fourth session Agenda items 23 and 62 Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) Advancement of women Letter dated 15 March 2010 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General In accordance with instructions received from the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, I have the honour to refer to the letter dated 12 January 2010 from the Permanent Representative of Argentina addressed to you, on the extension of the territorial application of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The Government of the United Kingdom has no doubt about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and their surrounding maritime areas. The Government of the United Kingdom rejects the claims by the Government of Argentina to sovereignty over any of these territories and maritime areas. In reference to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the United Kingdom has no doubt about its right to extend the application of these treaties to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The principle of self-determination, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, underlies our position on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. There can be no negotiation on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until such time as the Falkland Islanders so wish. I should be grateful if you would circulate the text of the present letter as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda items 23 and 62. (Signed) Mark Lyall Grant
