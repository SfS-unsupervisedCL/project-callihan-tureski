General Assembly Sixty-first session Agenda item 90 (bb) General and complete disarmament: establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia Security Council Sixty-first year Letter dated 8 September 2006 from the Permanent Representatives of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General We have the honour to transmit the text of the statement by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan (see annex), which was adopted at the ceremony of the signing of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia in Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan, on 8 September 2006. The new nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia will be unique in many ways. First, this zone will include a State that used to possess nuclear weapons. Second, for the first time ever, a nuclear-weapon-free zone will be established in the Northern Hemisphere. Third, the Treaty is the first multilateral agreement in the area of security that covers all five Central Asian States. Finally, for the first time ever, a nuclear-weapon-free zone is being established in a region that has an extensive common border with two nuclear-weapon States. We wish to emphasize the fact that for the first time, a process of drafting and agreeing on a new nuclear-weapon-free zone was conducted with the direct involvement and under the auspices of the United Nations. The Treaty not only will promote the security of the States parties but also will become an important confidence-building measure and an instrument of cooperation at the regional level.
