Sixty-first session Agenda items 7 and 121 Organization of work, adoption of the agenda and allocation of items: reports of the General Committee Pattern of conferences Letter dated 19 October 2006 from the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences addressed to the President of the General Assembly I am writing in connection with the provisions of paragraph 7 of section I of General Assembly resolution 40/243, according to which no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly may meet at United Nations Headquarters during a regular session of the Assembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly. Subsidiary organs that wish to meet during a regular session of the Assembly must submit their requests through the Committee on Conferences. I wish to inform you that the Committee on Conferences has received a request from the Executive Board of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) to hold one meeting in New York during the main part of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. The Committee on Conferences, having carefully considered this request and the reasons for it, does not object, on the strict understanding that the meeting would have to be accommodated when facilities and services can be made available without adversely affecting the activities of the General Assembly and its Main Committees. Accordingly, I should be grateful if the General Assembly would explicitly authorize the Executive Board of INSTRAW to meet in accordance with its request, subject to the conditions referred to above. (Signed) Nonye Udo Chairman Committee on Conferences
