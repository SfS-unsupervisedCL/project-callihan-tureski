GENERAL S/1998/1142 4 December 1998 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: FRENCH LETTER DATED 24 NOVEMBER 1998 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF MAURITANIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL I have the honour and the pleasure to inform you that on Friday, 20 November 1998 I proceeded, on behalf of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, to sign the agreement on the status of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), together with Mr. Bernard Miyet, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations.
