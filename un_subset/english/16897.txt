The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed donation of assets from the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (A/57/449). During its consideration of the report, the Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information. 2. UNMIBH was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1035 (1995) of 21 December 1995. The Mission's mandate has been extended several times by the Council, the most recently in its resolution 1423 (2002) of 12 July 2002, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission to 31 December 2002. 3. The Advisory Committee notes from the report that the Mission has formulated a preliminary asset disposal plan based on the principles and policies approved by the General Assembly in section VII of its resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994 and resolution 52/1 B of 26 June 1998 (ibid., para. 2). The Committee also notes that, as at 22 July 2002, the assets of UNMIBH were established at approximately $58.8 million ($58,727,500), at their inventory value, to be disposed as follows: $7.1 million to be donated to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina; $32.6 million to be transferred to the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi; $127,500 to be sold to United Nations agencies; and $18.9 million to be written off or disposed of commercially. 4. The assets proposed to be donated to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina include ablution and accommodation units, light vehicles, communication and office equipment, data-processing equipment, generators and medical accommodation and equipment (ibid., para. 6). 5. The action to be taken by the General Assembly is indicated in paragraph 7 of the report. The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee approve the proposed donation of assets with an inventory value of $7,103,200 to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
