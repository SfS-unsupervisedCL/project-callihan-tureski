Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict Conclusions on children and armed conflict in Yemen 1. At its 39th meeting, on 26 July 2013, the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict considered the first report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict in Yemen (S/2013/383), which was introduced by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. The Permanent Representative of Yemen participated in the subsequent discussion. 2. The members of the Working Group welcomed the presentation of the report of the Secretary-General, submitted in accordance with Security Council resolution 1612 (2005) and relevant subsequent resolutions, and took note of the analysis and recommendations contained therein. 3. The members of the Working Group welcomed the recent efforts deployed by the Government of Yemen to protect children from the effects of armed conflict. They expressed appreciation with regard to the adoption by the Cabinet of the action plan designed to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children under the age of 18, and expressed hope that the Government would sign the aforementioned action plan with the United Nations by the end of the year. The members of the Working Group stressed with concern that, despite positive developments, the situation of children affected by armed conflict remained a serious one and that children in Yemen continued to be victims of serious violations and abuses. 4. The Permanent Representative of Yemen noted that the political unrest in 2011 had led to widespread violations and abuses against children, but stressed that the peaceful transfer of power had since led to an improvement of the situation of the children in his country. He mentioned, in this respect, the Presidential decree banning the recruitment and use of children and the April 2013 order from the Minister for the Interior to all branches of the Ministry to fully implement Police Commission Law No.15 of 2000, which stipulates a minimum age of 18 for all new recruits and the immediate release of those under 18 years of age. He stressed that cooperation between his country and the United Nations had contributed to significant progress in the field of child protection. He confirmed that the proposed action plan had been endorsed by the interministerial committee and concluded his statement by reiterating his Government's commitment to pursue its efforts to ensure respect for children's rights. 5. Further to the meeting, subject to and consistent with applicable international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, including resolutions 1612 (2005), 1882 (2009), 1998 (2011) and 2068 (2012), the Working Group agreed to the following direct action: Public statement issued by the Chair of the Working Group 6.
