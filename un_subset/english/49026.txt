The actions to be taken by the General Assembly are set out in section V of the present report. 1. The budget for the maintenance of United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) for the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009 was set out in the report of the Secretary-General of 17 March 2008 (A/62/750) and amounted to $477,058,000 gross ($467,307,900 net). It provided for 200 military observers, 7,915 military contingents, 1,200 police personnel, including 750 in formed units, 498 international staff, 709 national staff inclusive of 66 national officers, 301 United Nations Volunteers and 12 staff on temporary positions. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in paragraph 34 of its report (A/62/781/Add.13), recommended that the General Assembly appropriate $476,959,900 gross for the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. 2. The General Assembly, by its resolution 62/254, appropriated an amount of $475,402,600 gross ($465,648,600 net) for the maintenance of the mission for the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. The total amount has been assessed on Member States. II. Mandate performance A. Overall 3. The mandate of the Operation was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1528 (2004) and has been extended in subsequent resolutions of the Council. The mandate for the performance period was provided by the Council in its resolutions 1795 (2008), 1826 (2008) and 1865 (2009). 4. The Operation is mandated to help the Security Council achieve an overall objective, namely, to re-establish peace, security and long-term stability in Côte d'Ivoire. 5. Within this overall objective, the Operation has, during the performance report period, contributed to a number of accomplishments by delivering related key outputs, shown in the frameworks below. These frameworks are grouped by components established by the Security Council in paragraph 2 of its resolution 1739 (2007): ceasefire; disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement; humanitarian and human rights; peace process; law and order; and support. 6. The present report assesses actual performance against the planned results-based-budgeting frameworks set out in the 2008/09 budget. In particular, the performance report compares the actual indicators of achievement, that is, the extent to which actual progress has been made during the period against the expected accomplishments, with the planned indicators of achievement, and the actually completed outputs with the planned outputs. 7. The Security Council, in its resolution 1865 (2009) endorsed the reduction of military personnel in UNOCI from 8,115 to 7,450 in the light of the progress achieved in the implementation of the key steps of the peace process and of the progress of the electoral process. The drawdown was completed in July 2009. In April 2009, France withdrew its engineering company deployed in UNOCI. 8. UNOCI, in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and with resources from the Peacebuilding Fund, continued to support the reintegration process through the implementation of microprojects benefiting a total of 2,768 ex-combatants, militias, women, and youths-at-risk. The 1,000 microprojects initiative remained the main ongoing opportunity for the reinsertion of ex-combatants and has largely contributed to a peaceful and secure environment in the area where demobilization has taken place. 9. The Operation continued to address justice-related challenges throughout the country. Partially owing to the advocacy efforts of UNOCI, the tenth European Development Fund approved by the European Commission on 2 April 2008 earmarked $23 million for support to judicial and penitentiary system reform in Côte d'Ivoire. 10. The identification and voter registration processes were officially completed by 30 June 2009 with 6,552,694 people, or 75 per cent of the projected number of people registered. UNOCI provided substantial logistical airlift capacity and transportation of identification agents and materials through the deployment of Operation Transport. UNOCI implemented quick-impact projects during the lead-up to the elections and to facilitate subsequent normalization of the situation in Côte d'Ivoire. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General remained in contact with all Ivorian parties involved in the electoral process and engaged the diplomatic corps and bilateral donors to provide support to the electoral process within the framework of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement in the form of financial support to the Elections Basket Fund administered by UNDP. 11. Efforts by the United Nations and the international community to mobilize funds to support the implementation of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement continued. The two basket funds established and administered by UNDP to support the electoral process and post-crisis peace consolidation activities were fully operational, and continued to receive external funding. To date, UNDP has raised over $95 million for both funds, including $11 million raised during the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. 12. The rate of prosecution of perpetrators of serious human rights violations brought to the attention of national authorities by UNOCI remained low, mainly because justice institutions in the Forces nouvelles zone did not resume work as had been anticipated. To enhance human rights awareness in the general population, on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, on 10 December 2008, UNOCI produced 28 special programmes on the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which were broadcast on Radio ONUCI-FM and on several community radio networks in the country. C. Regional mission cooperation 13. UNOCI, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and the United Nations Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) (United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) beginning 1 October 2008) continued to cooperate and coordinate their activities in the West African region. The heads of the missions met on a quarterly basis at the United Nations West Africa Administrative Conferences in order to identify areas of mutual cooperation, increase effectiveness of operations in the region by coordinating the efforts of the missions, identify best practices and address common deficiencies, improve the quality of services provided to the beneficiaries in the region, and create a forum for discussion and resolution of common issues within an integrated environment. As part of the strategy to enhance communications and information technology effectiveness and achieve efficiencies, UNOCI maintained a satellite link with UNMIL as a backup to the communications link located at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and provided the United Nations Office for West Africa (UNOWA) with communications equipment and technical assistance. The UNMIL-UNOCI microwave corridor project was completed, resulting in migration from satellite-based networks to a terrestrial network. Regional mission cooperation also continued in air operations, including the use of UNMIL aircraft in place of commercial flights for the rotation, emplacement and repatriation of troops from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Morocco and Jordan. 14. During the reporting period, the Operation also coordinated with the United Nations missions in Sierra Leone and Liberia on the implementation of a voluntary repatriation and resettlement programme for foreign ex-combatants. D. Partnerships and country team coordination 15. UNOCI and the United Nations country team continued preparatory work on the transition from the peacekeeping to the post-conflict stage in Côte d'Ivoire. In view of facilitating the transition from humanitarian emergency support towards early recovery and development interventions, the United Nations country team developed during the period, a transition strategy by focusing its efforts on three parallel agendas: (a) critical humanitarian needs, which supported the reinstallation and protection of internally displaced persons in the west, and food security in the north of Côte d'Ivoire; (b) support to the national Programme de sortie de crise through individual programmes from United Nations entities and the two basket funds administered by UNDP; and (c) the United Nations Development Assistance Framework for 2009-2013, with interventions by the United Nations system organizations in support of the implementation of the national Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 2009-2013. 16. UNOCI worked with partners from across the United Nations system to further strengthen the Organization's integrated approach in addressing peace consolidation and peacebuilding priorities in Côte d'Ivoire. In particular, during the period under review, the Office of the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General made progress in establishing joint United Nations planning and coordination structures that work around key programmatic priorities. E. Mission support initiatives 17. The Operation implemented a number of service improvements by streamlining and improving its administrative and logistical support functions, as described below. 18. The new contract for rations implemented a revised pricing structure resulting in a 15 per cent reduction in costs compared to the previous contract. However, these savings were offset by unfavourable fluctuations of the exchange rate of United States dollar to euro and an increase of 15 per cent in the Ceiling Man-day Rate from October 2008 as well as higher rental costs of a warehouse and containers. 19. As mentioned previously, the Operation used UNMIL shared aircraft in place of commercial flights for the rotation, emplacement and repatriation of troops from ECOWAS, Morocco and Jordan and formed police units from Jordan. F. Results-based-budgeting frameworks Component 1: ceasefire 20. During the reporting period, the Operation continued to support the restructuring of the armed forces of Côte d'Ivoire and the integration of former belligerent forces. This helped to stabilize the security situation in the country. UNOCI also monitored the arms embargo, and adherence of all parties to the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. The UNOCI military components assisted the Independent Electoral Commission in the identification and registration of voters for the upcoming elections. 21. As a result of the reconfiguration, fewer troops were required to perform static missions and the number of troops made available for mobile operations was maximized. All combat elements of military contingents were tasked to conduct long-range patrols, routine patrols, border patrols and escort duties, in addition to their assistance to voter identification and registration. They also provided vehicular support in the Polio Vaccination Programme 2009. stabilization of security conditions in Côte d'Ivoire Planned indicators of achievement Actual indicators of achievement No violations of the comprehensive ceasefire agreement of 3 May 2003 (2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 0; 2007/08: 0; 2008/09: 0) Achieved. There were no violations of the ceasefire agreement No reports of armed groups non-signatories to the comprehensive ceasefire agreement of 3 May 2003 threatening the civilian population (2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 0; 2007/08: 0; 2008/09: 0) Achieved. There were no reports of armed groups non-signatories threatening the civilian population Full compliance by Ivorian parties and neighbouring States with the arms embargo (2005/06: 0 incidents; 2006/07: 0 incidents; 2007/08: 0 incidents; 2008/09: 0 incidents) Of 661 planned embargo inspection visits during the reporting period, 35 could not be carried out owing to a lack of cooperation from Ivorian parties Integrated deployment of 4 United Nations police personnel within Ivorian Integrated Command Centre 3 United Nations police personnel served as technical advisers to the Integrated Command Centre Planned outputs Completed (number or yes/no) Remarks 598,600 mobile and foot troop patrol days (20 troops per patrol x 2 patrols per company x 41 companies x 365 days) Routine patrol days (26 troops per patrol x 2 patrols per company x 30 companies x 365 days) 186,150 troop security/control person days (30 troops per observation post x 17 observation posts x 365 days) Long-range patrols days (40 troops per long-range patrol x 12 long-range patrols x 365 days). In keeping with the provisions of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement, the observation posts were dismantled and UNOCI adjusted its posture and configuration. As a result, long-range mobile patrols were carried out in all required areas 1,440 air patrol hours (3 helicopters x 40 hrs/helicopter x 12 months) Air patrol hours (3 helicopters x 42.5 hrs/helicopter x 12 months) 37,230 military observers mobile patrol person days (2 military observers per patrol x 3 patrols x 17 team sites x 365 days) in Sectors East and West Military observers mobile person days (2 military observers per patrol x 3 patrols x 17 team sites x 365 days) 366 boat patrol days, including on the Abidjan Ebrié Lagoon, and emergency evacuation (2 boats x 183 days) No Boat patrolling was not carried out owing to an improved political and social situation in the country. Also, there was no emergency evacuation during the period 12 reports to the Côte d'Ivoire Sanctions Committee and the Security Council on compliance with the arms embargo Reports provided to the Côte d'Ivoire Sanctions Committee and the Security Council Organization and conduct of an average of 5 weekly inspections of the cargo on board aircraft and transport vehicles at 2 seaports, 3 airports, 4 airfields, 10 military bases and 5 border crossings Yes UNOCI conducted 6 weekly port patrols and 13 weekly airport patrols; 12 weekly Forces armées nationales de Côte d'Ivoire (FANCI)/Forces armées des forces nouvelles (FAFN) military camp inspections; monitoring of 6 vessels manifests per week; 3 spot air/sea cargo controls per month; and 33 UNMIL/UNOCI border monitoring meetings In addition, 174 United Nations police/military observers were trained on arms embargo inspection procedures, and 31 diamond mine over-flights and site visits were conducted Participation of the Force Commander in 10 meetings on regional and inter-mission cooperation, including with the ECOWAS Defence and Security Committees, UNIOSIL, UNMIL, and UNOWA, focused on containing cross-border movement of armed groups and operations against illegal movement of weapons Not all meetings on regional and inter-mission cooperation took place. However, the Force Commander attended the following two meetings: the 16th high-level meeting, held in Dakar in May 2009, and the 25th meeting of the Committee of Chiefs of Defence Staff of ECOWAS, in Ouagadougou in June 2009 Holding of monthly meetings with FANCI to advise it on monitoring borders, with particular attention to the movement of Liberian refugees, combatants and arms No regular meetings were held, but permanent contact was maintained through the FANCI liaison officer who visited the FANCI headquarters daily to provide reports. This approach was adopted to enhance mainstreaming of cross-border concerns Daily liaison with FANCI and the military elements of the Forces nouvelles to promote trust and confidence between all the Ivorian forces, including United Nations-Ivorian police/military joint patrols in Abidjan as well as in the green line zone and area of responsibility Daily liaison was undertaken 101,835 troop security person days for the close protection of ministers of the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and other major political leaders (279 troops x 365 days) Troop security person days provided as follows: static guards at 13 residences and one hotel for 24 hours per day for 365 days; escorts to 17 personalities as well as UNOCI cash convoys at various times within Abidjan and to various parts of the country; security at locations for meetings of Ivorian authorities Weekly press briefing to Ivorian population and the national and international media on understanding the role of the UNOCI forces in the context of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement The press briefing was provided weekly, and five press releases on average were provided per week Component 2: disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement 22. During the reporting period, the Operation assisted the Government in the implementation of the national disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme and coordinated with the United Nations missions in Sierra Leone and in Liberia on the implementation of a voluntary repatriation and resettlement programme for foreign ex-combatants. New modalities for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration in Côte d'Ivoire were laid out in the Fourth Supplementary Agreement to the Ouagadougou Political Agreement signed on 22 December 2008. For example, the agreement provided for the payment of a demobilization allowance of CFA 500,000 per ex-combatant. The required funds were not raised, however, and modalities for the disbursement of any funds to be disbursed remain unclear. 23. This led to the reorientation of the main objectives of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Section, which were to provide advice and support to the Integrated Command Centre and the National Programme for Reinsertion and Community Rehabilitation (PNRRC), to monitor and support the cantonment of both Forces de défense et de sécurité (FDS) and FAFN combatants, to assist with the reinsertion of demobilized ex-combatants and to assist with the disarmament and dismantling of militias. However, owing to budget constraints, a joint mission with UNIOSIL could not be carried out during the reporting period. In its advisory and support role, the Operation regularly interfaced with the offices of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, the Integrated Command Centre, FAFN and FDS, PNRRC and the National Programme of Civic Service (PSCN), with a view to expedite and properly implement the processes to disarm, demobilize and reintegrate ex-combatants and militias. A team comprising UNOCI disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, military and police liaison officers and UNDP, worked on a daily basis with the Integrated Command Centre to strengthen its planning and coordination capacities. The Operation continued to provide logistical support to the Command Centre, including transport and communication support. UNOCI also set up a reinsertion microprojects programme using funding from the peacebuilding fund to assist with the reinsertion of former combatants. Through its inter-agency coordination mechanism, the Operation facilitated coordination, policy development and decision-making with United Nations system agencies, funds and programmes, the donor community, and other non-governmental organizations for the overall disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process. Expected accomplishment 2.1: reintegration of national ex-combatants and former militias into Côte d'Ivoire society; repatriation and resettlement of foreign ex-combatants present in Côte d'Ivoire, with special attention to the specific needs of women and children Reinsertion, repatriation and resettlement of 42,564 Forces nouvelles ex-combatants in Côte d'Ivoire (2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 0; 2007/08: 0; 2008/09: 37,150) As of 30 June 2009, 11,766 FAFN ex-combatants had registered, of whom 4,065 volunteered to join the national army (Volontaire pour la nouvelle armée (VAN)) and 7,701 opted to be demobilized, including 471 women and 802 non-Ivorians. The number of regrouped FAFN elements is lower than planned, as the regroupment operation was suspended at the end of October 2008 owing to logistics and financial constraints. FAFN is expected to present a new timeline for the completion of the regroupment exercise Meanwhile, as at 30 June 2009, 2,768 ex-combatants, ex-militias and youth at risk were benefiting from the UNDP/UNOCI 1,000 microprojects programme. In addition, according to figures provided by PNRRC a total of 917 beneficiaries had received reinsertion or reintegration support through other programmes by 31 December 2008 Rehabilitation, reintegration and reunification with families of former child soldiers (2006/07: 0; 2007/08: 3,000; 2008/09: 6,000) The original estimates for the number of child soldiers in Côte d'Ivoire was found to be far beyond the actual figure as only 2,813 children, of whom 1,300 were formerly associated with armed groups, have been identified and assisted by PNRRC, which has been implemented since September 2008 Côte d'Ivoire has been removed from the list of countries using child soldiers Reintegration of 1,019 former members of militias (2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 500; 2007/08: 2,000; 2008/09: 1,019) As at 30 June 2009, a total of 37,436 militia elements had been profiled and their militia groups dismantled. Although by 30 June 2009 some disarmament had taken place and the profiling of the militias had been completed, their reintegration had not yet started. This will be carried out through the payment of a CFA 500,000 francs cash allowance, however the modalities for this have yet to be defined PSCN launched in February 2009 its training programme for 270 youth at risk and ex-militiamen in Guiglo (the western part of the country) 757 ex-militia members took part in reinsertion activities run as a part of the 1,000 microprojects programme Preparation and implementation of action plans by parties to the conflict on ending the use of child soldiers (2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 2; 2007/08: 2; 2008/09: 2) Forces de défense et de sécurité des Forces nouvelles (FDS-FN) and other parties in conflict signed action plans on 10 October 2005 and 14 September 2006 to end use of child soldiers. Parties have been de-listed from annexes of the report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict (S/2007/757) as a result of a successful implementation of action plans Participation of 10,000 former members of unarmed militias in sustainable economic and development programmes administered by the civic service programme, the National Programme on Reinsertion and Community Rehabilitation, UNDP and non-governmental organizations (2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 0; 2007/08: 10,000; 2008/09: 10,000) The two national structures (PNRRC and PSCN) in charge of reinsertion programmes faced financial constraints regarding the implementation of reinsertion programmes. UNOCI, in collaboration with UNDP, maintained its support to the reinsertion process, including for some militias, through the microprojects programme Advice to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire on the establishment of a task force on the implementation of economic and development reinsertion programmes for ex-combatants and former militia members, with special advice on the specific needs of women and children through the organization of ad hoc meetings UNOCI Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Section provided advice to national authorities in charge of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes in Abidjan, Yamoussoukro, and at the regional level on all relevant documents and related activities. Several documents and activities were planned jointly with national structures, such as the Operational Plan and FAFN Regroupment Plan A task force could not be established as the national structures in charge of the reinsertion programmes (PNRRC and PSCN) were not fully operational owing to financial constraints Advice to the National Programme on Reinsertion and Community Rehabilitation as well as the civic service programme on the establishment of the monitoring framework for the numbers and status of ex-combatants, with special attention to the specific needs of women and children through weekly coordination meetings UNOCI established a coordination mechanism at field and headquarters level with PNRRC, Service Civique and Cellule de micro projet de la Présidence in September 2008. Two main structures were established, the Project Committee at the regional level and the Projects Approval Committee at the national level, to deal with reinsertion activities for ex-combatants and ex-militias. Through this mechanism, PNRRC and the local authorities identify reinsertion opportunities for ex-combatants, ex-militias and youth at risk. PNRRC keeps track of ex-combatants and ex-militia elements who are in a reinsertion programme and updates its database accordingly, and local authorities monitor the reinsertion programme in their respective locations Daily coordination meetings between the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration-Integrated Implementation Cell and the Integrated Command Centre to implement and monitor the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and disarmament and demobilization of the militias process The UNOCI Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Operations Centre established at Integrated Command Centre headquarters continued to support the Command Centre in strengthening its planning and coordination. UNOCI continued to maintain an integrated implementation cell comprised of military, police, and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration civilian personnel. One Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Officer, three military liaison officers and a three United Nations police liaison officers team worked on a daily basis with the Integrated Command Centre. The Operation continued to provide logistical support to the Integrated Command Centre, including transportation and communication support Regular meetings with government institutions and international stakeholders to elaborate, plan and implement the security sector reform Major issues such as the rank of FAFN military elements and regroupment of 5,000 FAFN for the new army were not addressed. Therefore, there was no major development with regard to the security sector reform process. UNOCI provided support to the Integrated Command Centre to elaborate an action plan on the implementation of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration/disarmament and dismantling of militias process following the signing of the Fourth Supplementary Agreement to the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. This action plan was presented to the four generals (FAFN Chief of Staff, FDS Chief of Staff, UNOCI Force Commander, and Licorne Commander) in January 2009 Regular meetings to advise the governmental institutions concerned on the implementation of a nationwide public information programme in support of the reinsertion, community reintegration and reconciliation programme UNOCI participated in meetings with national structures in charge of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, in particular with PNRRC, to discuss sensitization activities for the reintegration of ex-combatants. In this regard, the Operation and PNRRC work closely to draft the 2009 communication strategy as well as plan sensitization events such as: the Special Representative of the Secretary-General sensitization caravan tour on 1,000 microprojects, and Caravan de la paix -- messages on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration/1,000 microprojects Organization of monthly inter-agency coordination meetings with the World Bank, UNDP, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, European Union, NGOs and the donor community involved in reintegration, repatriation and resettlement programmes for implementation of reinsertion programmes and mobilization of financial resources to meet funding shortfalls Monthly coordination meetings were not organized owing to the slow progress of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities. In January 2009, however, UNOCI organized a meeting on reinsertion activities with the World Bank, the International Organization for Migration, the European Union, UNDP, the United Nations Office for Project Services and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The purpose of the meeting was to share updates on reinsertion projects to provide a coordinated approach with regard to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration activities contained in the Fourth Supplementary Agreement to the Ouagadougou Agreement The Operation's Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Section also liaised regularly with UNDP in order to provide technical and logistical support to the Integrated Command Centre in Yamassoukro for dealing with disarmament and demobilization issues, and with donors on reinsertion and reintegration issues. The 1,000 microprojects programme is one of the results of such consultation Organization of quarterly meetings with the National Programme on Reinsertion and Community Rehabilitation, UNMIL, UNIOSIL, UNDP, World Bank, European Union, ECOWAS, African Union, donor community and neighbouring countries, particularly Guinea, on the regional dimensions of the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and resettlement programmes, with special attention to the specific needs of women and children The planned quarterly meetings with stakeholders on regional dimensions were not organized owing to slow progress in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process and the lack of information with regards to foreign ex-combatants UNOCI and UNMIL, however, carried out 2 joint missions to assess the presence of Liberian ex-combatants in the western part of Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia In addition, UNOCI organized 2 workshops to increase the understanding of gender as a concept and practice among all partners involved in disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and to build capacity on gender and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration within national counterparts such as the PNRRC, Bureau général de démobilisation, the Integrated Command Centre, the microprojects implementing partners and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration officers in the sectors Public information campaign on the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, including: daily radio programmes in 5 local languages, distribution of 25,000 pamphlets/leaflets, 200 posters, 20 briefings to the media, diplomatic community and civil society; and 12 forums and outreach activities on sensitization ONUCI-FM broadcast daily updates on the evolution of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, in French and 5 local languages In each of 12 forums organized for local civil society, the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process was highlighted, and after August 2008 themes included the 1,000 microprojects initiative 2,500 copies of a leaflet on the 1,000 microprojects initiative were published. The initiative and other disarmament, demobilization and reintegration-related issues were also the main focus of the August 2008 newsletter. 16,500 leaflets were distributed and 52 press briefings were held on this issue. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and the 1,000 microprojects programme were the focus of 19 of the UNOCI weekly press conferences UNOCI participated in meetings with national partners, in particular with PNRRC Communication Cell, on all issues related to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration sensitization activities in particular in relation to the 1,000 microprojects programme, including coordinating the 1,000 microprojects/ disarmament, demobilization and reintegration communication draft strategy 2009 and sensitization events, and working on 1,000 microprojects documentary production and radio programmes Security arrangements for 17 disarmament sites within the 11 disarmament, demobilization and reintegration zones, including security of weapons and ammunition collection and storage sites The security of the 17 disarmament sites within the 11 disarmament, demobilization and reintegration zones has been under Integrated Command Centre's responsibility since the establishment of the Centre in April 2007. The 3 disarmament, demobilization and reintegration camps in the north and the 4 disarmament and dismantling of militias weapons collection points in the west were handed over to the Integrated Command Centre on 15 March 2008. Therefore, the security of these camps and collections points has been under the Centre's responsibility since the commencement of the performance period Collection, safekeeping/storage, transportation and/or neutralization/ destruction of weapons, ammunition and other military materials in 17 disarmament sites A small quantity of weapons, ammunition and grenades were collected during FAFN regroupment immediately preceding the performance period. These remained under FAFN control pursuant to the request of the FAFN Chief of Staff. During the profiling and dismantling of militia operations, a small quantity of weapons, ammunition and grenades were handed over by militia groups. These weapons were under the control of the Integrated Command Centre No destruction of weapons ammunition and other military material occurred during the reporting period Organization of a workshop on women and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, in cooperation with the Integrated Command Centre, the National Programme on Reinsertion and Community Rehabilitation, UNDP, civil society and representatives of women ex-combatants A training session on women and disarmament was organized for all actors involved with the 1,000 microproject reinsertion programme in the framework of the seminar held in Bouake on 20 March 2009. The participants included local partners, beneficiaries, PNRRC, civil society, and the Integrated Command Centre Training of 100 ex-combatants as HIV/AIDS peer educators in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the Integrated Command Centre and the National Programme on Reinsertion and Community Rehabilitation 24 ex-combatants were trained in HIV/AIDS peer education. This joint project by UNOCI, UNDP and UNFPA is expected to be completed in December 2009, with a lower target of 50 trainees. The lower than planned number of ex-combatants trained was attributable to delays in the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process Implementation of 5 quick-impact projects on community rehabilitation and economic development Quick-impact projects on community rehabilitation and economic development were implemented in areas where ex-combatants were concentrated. They comprised 2 agricultural projects, 1 rehabilitation of a youth centre, 1 health project and 1 sensibilization campaign on the proliferation of light arms Component 3: humanitarian and human rights 24. During the reporting period, the Operation continued to provide technical assistance to the Ivorian Government and other national stakeholders in order to address post-conflict humanitarian needs and to establish a culture of respect for human rights, with particular attention to the situation of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, notably women, children, internally displaced persons and people affected by or living with HIV/AIDS. Although human rights generally improved after the signature of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement, there had been serious human rights violations for which perpetrators went unprosecuted, reinforcing a culture of impunity. The Human Rights Section, through its nine field offices, monitored and produced reports on the human rights situation, which were shared with national and international stakeholders and were used for advocacy to the Government and Forces nouvelles on the enforcement of measures to fight impunity and bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes. Special focus was given to the high number of cases regarding sexual and gender-based violence and children's rights. Technical cooperation activities were carried out to strengthen the capacity of national stakeholders, the Government, the national human rights commission and civil society groups, to promote, protect and implement basic human rights provisions. Expected accomplishment 3.1: progress towards respect for human rights and accountability for human rights violations in Côte d'Ivoire Investigation by national and international human rights organizations and NGOs operating in Côte d'Ivoire of human rights violations and issuance of reports on the human rights situation in the country (2005/06: 4 reports; 2006/07: 8 reports; 2007/08: 5 reports; 2008/09: 5 reports) Achieved. 6 human rights reports by the human rights organizations concerned were issued Perpetrators of serious human rights violations are identified and brought to the attention of competent civilian and/or military judicial authorities (2005/06: 95; 2006/07: 52; 2007/08: 30; 2008/09: 35) 343 cases of serious human rights violations were documented and brought to the attention of national and local civilian and military authorities. Out of 343, 24 cases were tried before competent courts in the Government-controlled zones Establishment of an Observatoire des Droits de la Femme (women's rights observatory), to monitor respect for women's human rights At 30 June 2009, the network of women organizations was in the process of finalizing the establishment of the Observatory with support from the Gender Unit. The mechanism is expected to be fully functional by September 2009. The delay is explained by the lengthy negotiations to reach a common understanding of this structure, so the Observatoire des Droits de la Femme can be seen as a shared structure accommodating all components of the women's networks Advocacy through meetings, seminars, conferences and public awareness campaigns for the signature/ratification of additional international human rights instruments and assistance in the preparation and submission of reports to relevant treaty bodies Advocacy was provided through meetings with national authorities which focused on obligations to comply with relevant treaty bodies and other international obligations Advice to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire and the National Human Rights Commission and civil society organizations, through meetings, workshops, seminars and conferences, on human rights issues and standards UNOCI provided technical assistance on a monthly basis to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire in the process of drafting the universal periodic review report.

During the reporting period, the Operation continued to support the efforts of all parties to the Ouagadougou Political Agreement and its implementation, towards the holding of open, free, fair and transparent presidential and legislative elections, and the reunification of the country. UNOCI provided support to the implementation of electoral tasks as stipulated in the Agreement. This included the issuance of duplicate birth certificates through public hearings, voter registration and the general identification of the population. However, the following steps were not completed owing to financial and technical reasons: printing and distribution of national identification and voters' cards; distribution of electoral material; and electoral campaigning before polling day. UNOCI also assisted in setting up the Independent Electoral Commission, strengthening the capacity of the identification personnel and the 13,400 national electoral personnel, assisted in the audit of the 2,000 electoral maps, and supported the Commission nationale de supervision de l'identification in its deployment. The Operation supported the redeployment of Government administration and restoration of State authority, which was a major prerequisite for the effective reunification of Côte d'Ivoire. Much progress was achieved in the redeployment of Government officials with technical support from UNOCI as well as financial and logistical assistance from key bilateral and multilateral donors. However, effective restoration of State authority remained hampered owing to a lack of adequate logistical and financial resources to provide suitable working and living conditions for redeployed officials; the reluctance of the Forces nouvelles to relinquish their hold on security and financial matters to Government officials; delays in re-establishing the judiciary system; and redeploying adequate police to the north, centre and west. reunification of Côte d'Ivoire Continued participation in the process by all Ivorian parties pursuant to Security Council resolution 1765 (2007) and the Ouagadougou Political Agreement Achieved.

Legal analysis and monitoring of rule of law institutions continued. Support was provided to the Ministry of Justice to develop a strategic plan for justice system reform, which was included in the matrix for the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. Efforts were also made to secure funding for projects and as a consequence the European Commission undertook to allocate 18 million euros from its tenth European Development Fund.

Draft laws for the establishment of the three supreme jurisdictions created by the Constitution were prepared by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights but had not been adopted The indicator was based on the assumption that legislative elections would be held during the performance period, so a newly elected Parliament could deliberate and adopt the laws in question. After the postponement of the 30 November 2008 presidential election, the timing of the adoption of these laws remains uncertain Establishment of 11 courts in the northern part of Côte d'Ivoire and full redeployment of judicial personnel (2004/05: 0; 2005/06: 0; 2006/07: 0; 2007/08: 3; 2008/09: 11) All 11 courts in the centre-nord-ouest zone reopened and commenced to operate. The courts considered civil matters related to the reconstitution of the civil registry and issued administrative documents such as criminal records and identity documents. The full functionality of the courts, however, was pending resolution of logistical difficulties regarding the redeployment of the investigative police, court clerks and penitentiary staff Increase in the number of prison facilities reopened in the northern prefectures of Côte d'Ivoire (2006/07: 0; 2007/08: 3; 2008/09: 11) 5 prison facilities functioned with limited capacity in the northern prefectures under Forces nouvelles authority. No prison facilities under government authority reopened during the reporting period The buildings of all 11 prisons in the north have been rehabilitated, thus the infrastructure for reopening of all prisons was available. There is, however, no date set yet for reopening of prisons in the northern prefectures. The reopening of all prisons in the centre-nord-ouest zone is contingent upon the redeployment of investigative police. Provisions of the Fourth Supplementary Agreement to the Ouagadougou Agreement that mandate the deployment of investigative police in the centre-nord-ouest zone to support the reopening of the courts have not yet been implemented Reduction in the number of deaths in custody/prisons (2004/05: 376; 2005/06: 300; 2006/07: 225; 2007/08: 214; 2008/09: 190) Achieved.

Another contributing factor was early repatriation of the French Engineer Unit in April 2009 Operation of a daily shuttle service 5 days a week for an average of 600 United Nations personnel per day from their accommodation to operation area Daily shuttle service 5 days a week. An average of 609 passengers per day were transported mission wide during the financial period Air transportation Operation and maintenance of 4 fixed-wing and 9 rotary-wing aircraft (including 3 military-type and 2 SAR-capable helicopters, and 4 on commercial contracts) in 4 locations 4 fixed-wing aircraft were operated and maintained. 1 fixed-wing aircraft was depositioned in May 2009 following postponement of the elections 9 rotary-wing aircraft (including 2 military-type helicopters and 6 helicopters on commercial contracts) in 3 locations -- Abidjan, Bouaké, and Daloa. 1 MI-17 crashed on 28 October, 2008 and was not replaced until 30 June 2009 1 MI-8 aircraft previously based in Yamoussoukro was redeployed in Daloa Airport owing to security reasons, thus reducing number of locations from 4 to 3 Supply of 7.8 million litres of petrol, oil and lubricants for air operations 5.8 million litres For air transportation. Decrease in the consumption owing to the full operationalization of the 5 aviation fuel farms in 5 different locations throughout the country Naval transportation Operation and maintenance of 2 boats Boats maintained. The boats were not operated owing to an improved political and social situation in the country. Naval transport used for voter registration and identification was rented as it was determined to be more cost effective Supply of 43,800 litres of petrol, oil and lubricants for naval transportation No petrol oil and lubricants were supplied for naval transportation, as two marine boats were maintained but not operated as planned owing to an improved political and social situation in the country Communications Support and maintenance of a satellite network consisting of 1 Earth station HUB and 71 narrowband digital radio system to provide voice, fax, video and data communications Number of narrowband digital radio system to provide voice, fax, and video and data communications changed to 72.

Resource performance A. Financial resources Subtotal General temporary assistance Civilian electoral observers Consultants Official travel Special equipment Other supplies, services and equipment Quick-impact projects B. Monthly expenditure pattern 30. The higher levels of expenditure in September and October 2008 as well as May and June 2009 were attributed mainly to the obligation of funds relating to troop-cost reimbursements for military contingents and formed police units, reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment costs for the first and second half of the fiscal year, respectively. C.

The additional requirements were mainly attributable to loss on exchange owing to the weakening of the United States dollar against the CFA franc at an average of 8 per cent. Daily mission subsistence allowance is set in CFA francs but is payable in United States dollars. Thus the mission subsistence allowance rate increased from the planned provision of $191 per day for the first 30 days and $122 per day after 30 days, to $210 per day for the first 30 days and $131 per day after 30 days. The additional requirements were partially offset by a higher delayed deployment factor of 3.8 per cent compared to the planned factor of 2 per cent as well as the recording of lower mission subsistence allowance payments owing to a change in policy on within-mission travel and the recording of expenditure. 32. The variance was attributable mainly to higher than expected costs for commercial air charter services for the rotation of troops owing to several factors, such as aircraft positioning and depositioning costs, fuel costs, overflight and landing clearance charges, handling charges of the aircraft, passengers and baggage at the various airports. In addition, increased requirements were attributable to higher actual costs of rations owing to the lower than anticipated rate of exchange of the United States dollar to euro and also the higher than planned costs for rental of warehouse space and containers. The higher requirements were partly offset by the reduced requirements for contingent-owned equipment owing to the early repatriation of an engineering unit in April 2009. 33. The variance was mainly attributable to the lower number of rotations and repatriations during the period as more United Nations police officers opted to extend their contract after one-year assignment, as well as recording of lower mission subsistence allowance payments owing to a change in policy on within-mission travel and the recording of expenditure. 34. The additional requirements were attributable to the non-budgeted payment of invoices from the previous period as funds previously set aside were insufficient to cover the reimbursements. In addition, the commercial air charter costs for rotation of formed police units were higher than planned owing to increase in market prices. This increase was partly offset by the recording of warehouse and refrigeration costs under the military contingents class of expenditures. 35. Higher requirements were mainly attributable to the reimbursement of minimum operating residential security standard costs ($1.2 million) to international staff, and increased requirements for the payment of salaries owing to the revised salary scales effective 1 January 2009. The additional requirements were partially offset by lower actual travel to hazardous locations than anticipated owing to the postponement of travel in support of the elections. 36. Lower requirements were mainly attributable to the high average vacancy rate early in the period. The Operation was able to address this and to substantially decrease the vacancy rate towards the end of the period. The variance was also due to lower requirements for hazardous duty station payments owing to lower actual travel to the hazardous locations in the light of the postponement of the elections. 37. The additional requirements under this heading were attributable to the lower actual vacancy rate for United Nations Volunteers. The actual vacancy was 3 per cent as compared to the projected vacancy rate of 10 per cent. 38. Additional requirements were attributable mainly to the continuation of positions of the Electoral Certification Support Cell. As at 30 June 2009, the actual number of staff on board was three owing to the postponement of the elections. Another factor contributing to higher requirements was the lower than projected exchange rate of the United States dollar to the CFA franc as the mission subsistence allowance is set in CFA francs but is payable in dollars. 39. The increased requirements were attributable to the services provided by international consultants to assist the Operation with the Integrated Embargo Monitoring Unit in order to fulfil the Operation's mandate and the Personnel Section to assist with the national staff reclassification. The increased requirements were partially offset by the recording of costs for Language Assistants against the other supplies, services and equipment class of expenditure. 40. Higher requirements were attributable mainly to the recording of a portion of mission subsistence allowance payments under within-mission travel owing to a change in policy on within-mission travel and the recording of expenditure. The additional requirements were partly offset by decreases in training-related travel owing to more training courses taking place in the region instead of at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi or in New York, as well as replacement of 6 external training courses with in-house courses. 41. Higher requirements were attributable to the increase in minimum operating residential security standards reimbursements to the military and police personnel, as well as increased utilization of high-capacity generators for the construction of new camps in Adzope and Divo, relocation of the camp in Séguéla and expansion of the camp in Toulépleu. Other factors giving rise to the increased requirements were the acquisition of 30 generators for remote areas and to support data processing as well as higher rental costs of the premises used for troop accommodation and transition camp. This was partially offset by reduced requirements for outsourced maintenance services as some of the planned projects were carried out by the Government while other projects were postponed. Other offsetting factors included deferral of the planned upgrade of the air-conditioning system at the Sebroko Main Building and deferral of the planned acquisition of consumables and supplies used for production of bottled water and other equipment and spare parts. 42. The variance was attributable primarily to the 34 per cent lower consumption of fuel from a projected consumption of 11.6 million litres to actual consumption of 7.6 million litres. Another contributing factor was the lower actual cost of fuel of $0.99 per litre as compared to the planned cost of fuel of $1.58 per litre. 43. Higher requirements were attributable mainly to increases in the guaranteed fleet cost and in cost per flight hour for the LearJet 35 and two DHC-7 aircraft and the rental of an additional DHC-7 aircraft to support the elections. This was partly offset by lower costs as a result of substituting an AS-330 Puma helicopter with an Mi-8MTV. 44. The reduced requirements under this heading were attributable to the nonutilization of two marine boats owing to an improved political and social situation in the country. Naval transport used for voter registration and identification was rented as it was determined to be more cost-effective. 45. The reduced requirements were attributable to the delay in the establishment of the community multimedia centres throughout the country as a result of security concerns and the non-availability of security personnel and troops to monitor the affected areas. In addition, the installation of the external connection line between Abidjan and the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi was deferred owing to the disputes between the vendor and its local business partner. Installation of the Yamoussoukro-Korhogo connection line was also postponed to the next period. 46. The reduced requirements were mainly attributable to the lower cost of information technology licenses acquired centrally through global purchase contracts as well as the deferral of the procurement of spare parts, supplies and maintenance and repair equipment as some items were not available in the system contracts. 47. Reduced requirements were attributable mainly to the lower incidence of medical evacuation travel and hospitalization services, fewer medical interventions, and lower cost of the outsourced medical services by substituting them with inhouse capacity. This was partly offset by the increase in self-sustainment reimbursement rates effective 1 July 2008 and the transfer of personnel from the United Nations Clinic to the troop-contributing countries level-II hospitals. 48. The variance is attributable to lower actual requirements for the reimbursement of formed police-contributing Governments for self-sustainment costs owing to items not being provided as expected pursuant to memorandums of understanding. In addition, requirements were lower owing to the reversal of the previously overpaid reimbursement for explosive ordinance disposal for one troop-contributing country. 49. The reduced requirements were attributable mainly to lower bank charges owing to the payment of mission subsistence allowance and voluntary living allowance through bank transfers instead of local banks owing to the nonavailability of bank accounts in Abidjan, deferment of payment of third-party claims and adjustments until further review of occupation of land, property and rental disputes, purchase of fewer medals owing to the lower number of uniformed personnel deployed during the period, as well as a decrease in printing and reproduction costs. These costs were partly offset by additional inland transportation costs relating to the transport of electoral materials. V. Actions to be taken by the General Assembly 50. The actions to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNOCI are: (a) To decide on the treatment of the unencumbered balance of $29,300 with respect to the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009; (b) To decide on the treatment of other income/adjustments for the period ended 30 June 2009 amounting to $6,987,400 from interest income ($1,687,400), other/miscellaneous income ($1,096,000) and cancellation of prior-period obligations ($4,204,000).
