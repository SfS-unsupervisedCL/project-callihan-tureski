By its resolution 56/254 of 24 December 2001, the General Assembly appropriated $98,338,700 for special political missions under section 3, Political affairs, of the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003. Since that provision has been more than fully allocated for other operations approved by the General Assembly and the Security Council, the resource requirements contained in the present report are being sought under the procedures provided for in paragraph 11 of annex I to resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986. The present report contains the proposed resource requirements for the United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peace-building (UNTOP), whose operation has been extended for 12 months, to 31 May 2003. The total requirements of UNTOP for the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003 amount to $2,077,600 net ($2,313,900 gross). After taking into account the unencumbered balance of $221,900 under the existing appropriation for UNTOP, an amount of $1,855,700 ($2,092,000 gross) would be required for the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003.

Cost estimates for the United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peace-building for the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003 A. Summary statement B. Supplementary information 1. The United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peace-building (UNTOP) was established in June 2000 with the support of the Security Council as expressed in its Presidential statement (S/PRST/2000/9) in response to the Secretary-General's proposal to establish an office for post-conflict peace-building in Tajikistan, and following the withdrawal of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT). 2. In view of the important and positive role played by UNTOP, the operation of the Office was extended in May 2001 for a further period of one year until the end of May 2002. The related resource requirements for the period from 1 June to 31 December 2001 were authorized by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions under the terms of General Assembly resolution 54/252 of 23 December 1999 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenditures, and were subsequently requested and approved in the context of the second performance report on the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 (A/56/674 and Corr.1). The requirements of UNTOP for the period from 1 January to 31 May 2002 were approved by the Assembly in its resolution 56/254 of 24 December 2001. 3. In a letter dated 26 April 2002 (S/2002/501), the Secretary-General informed the Security Council that, in view of the very positive role played by UNTOP, as well as the country's continuing need for support in its peace-building efforts and with the concurrence of the Government of Tajikistan, it was his intention to continue the activities of UNTOP for a further period of one year, to the end of May 2003. 4. In his reply of 1 May 2002 (S/2002/502), the President of the Security Council informed the Secretary-General that his letter had been brought to the attention of the members of the Security Council and that they had taken note with appreciation of the information provided and of the intention of the Secretary-General to continue the activities of UNTOP for another year. 5. The resource requirements of UNTOP for the 12-month period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003 are estimated at $2,077,600 net ($2,313,900 gross). It is recalled that by its resolution 56/254, the General Assembly approved for UNTOP, for a five-month period ending 31 May 2002, a charge of $772,900 against the provision for special political missions under section 3, Political affairs, of the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003. It is estimated that an amount of $221,900 would remain unencumbered against that appropriation at the end of May 2002. The net resource requirements for UNTOP for the 12-month period starting 1 June 2002 would therefore amount to $1,855,700 net ($2,092,000 gross). The details of the requirements are provided in the annex to the present report.

Structure of the mission 6. The peace process in Tajikistan has been playing a positive role in bringing about the restoration of normalcy. After several years of fighting, the transition is difficult and was disturbed by several serious crises. The political parties in the country are determined, however, to overcome the obstacles and put their country on the path to national reconciliation. Since the deeply rooted causes of the conflict had not yet been totally eradicated, the United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peace-building was established to pursue the political objectives of post-conflict peace-building. 7. The fundamental political objectives of post-conflict peace-building are to help ensure the consolidation of peace and to prevent a relapse into conflict. To pursue those objectives effectively, United Nations peace-building efforts need to be well-harmonized, multidimensional and fully integrated. In the discharge of those objectives, the Office is responsible for the following functions: (a) Providing the political framework and leadership for post-conflict peace-building activities of the United Nations system in the country, and supporting the efforts of the Resident Coordinator and those of the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods institutions, in promoting an integrated approach in the development and implementation of post-conflict peace-building programmes aimed at national reconstruction and reconciliation; (b) Mobilizing, in close cooperation with the United Nations country team, international support for the implementation of targeted programmes aimed at strengthening the rule of law, demobilization, voluntary arms collection and job creation for former combatants; (c) Helping to create an enabling environment for consolidating peace, democracy and the rule of law; (d) Liaising with the Government, political parties and other representatives of civil society to broaden national consensus and reconciliation. 8. UNTOP works very closely with the United Nations country team, providing political leadership for its post-conflict peace-building activities. Since its establishment in 2000, the Office has been comprehensively monitoring the situation in areas of high volatility and sharing its analyses with operational United Nations agencies acting in those areas. The Office channels its activities and peace-building projects to the parts of the country that suffered most from the atrocities of civil war and that require the most urgent assistance. 9. Through daily consultations and frequent briefings on current political developments in Tajikistan, UNTOP provides the political leadership for overall activities of the United Nations system in the country, including the Bretton Woods institutions. It assists other United Nations programmes in Tajikistan in identifying areas and target groups in connection with the creation of employment opportunities for former combatants. The successful donor meeting in Tokyo in May 2001 was the result of excellent collaboration among UNTOP, the United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank and the rest of the country team. 10. Members of the country team participate actively in the UNTOP-organized political discussion club, which facilitates the identification of potential areas for United Nations system programmes in Tajikistan. 11. The Office will continue to maintain close contact with different parts of Tajik society in order to broaden national consensus and further consolidate the still fragile reconciliation process. Within the context of its political discussion club, UNTOP will address issues related to local authorities' performance under democratic conditions and in a market economy. In cooperation with central and local authorities, non-governmental organizations and business and agricultural sector representatives, UNTOP will organize and lead seven sessions of the club. The recommendations resulting from those sessions will be published and shared with all concerned at the local and central levels, as well as with international organizations and international financial institutions. In the field of human rights, in cooperation with international and local partners, UNTOP will assist Tajikistan in building up its capacity with respect to human rights treaty reporting and human rights education. 12. Bearing in mind that the consolidation of peace and national unity depends on the progress made in strengthening the rule of law and respect for human rights in Tajikistan, support and advice will be provided for training local police in the methods and techniques of policing. Similarly, the reintegration of former combatants into civilian life and the creation of employment opportunities for them remains a priority. This would be advanced through the implementation of projects, including irrigation reconstruction, infrastructure rehabilitation and construction and safe drinking water and sanitation projects. Furthermore, the vocational training activities for servicemen released from contractual military service, through which training in civilian professions is provided to about 800 demobilized servicemen per year, would be continued. 13. With a view to overcoming the consequences of the civil war, UNTOP would provide support to a project to create a counselling centre for the psychological rehabilitation of ex-combatant and female-headed families. 14. UNTOP is headed by the Representative of the Secretary-General, and is supported by a team of 9 international and 21 local staff. III. Estimated requirements for the mission for the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003 15. The estimated requirements for the United Nations Tajikistan Office of Peace-building for the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003 would amount to $2,313,900 (gross).
