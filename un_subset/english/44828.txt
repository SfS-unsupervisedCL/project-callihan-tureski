Information and communications technology and disaster risk reduction Subprogramme 6. Social development Subprogramme 7. Statistics Subprogramme 8. Subregional activities for development Legislative mandates 15.1 The mandate of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), which is to promote economic and social development in the Asian and Pacific region by fostering cooperation between its members and associate members, is derived from Economic and Social Council resolutions 37 (IV) and 414 (XIII), by which the Commission was established. The mandate of the Commission was subsequently elaborated in various resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Commission itself. In particular, the Commission, in the Shanghai Declaration, contained in its resolution 60/1, emphasized the need for regional cooperation and capacity-building to meet development challenges in an era of globalization and, in the Almaty Declaration: commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, contained in its resolution 63/1, underscored its role as a regional development centre in providing an effective response to the changing needs of the countries in the Asian and Pacific region. 15.2 Asia and the Pacific is a region of diversity and disparity, which presents a mixed picture in terms of progress towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Based on overall figures, the region is the most dynamic and economically vibrant in the world. Trade and investment, which have grown exponentially, have contributed to lifting more than 300 million people out of extreme poverty. At the current rate of progress, the region is expected to achieve universal primary education by 2015. 15.3 Despite such impressive progress, the region still accounts for over 60 per cent of the world's poor (641 million) and almost 70 per cent of the total number of people (over 1.9 billion) without access to basic sanitation. Over a quarter of a million women die each year during pregnancy and childbirth, and some 660 million people lack access to clean water. In a region rich in energy resources, 800 million people live without electricity. Environmental sustainability is also becoming an increasingly alarming issue in the region, which is responsible for 34 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and is home to 7 of the 15 major global emitters of such emissions. Worldwide, 74 per cent of the casualties caused by natural disasters take place in countries in Asia and the Pacific, and 8 of the 10 countries in the world most frequently hit by natural disasters are located in the region. 15.4 The notable progress in some social and economic areas masks persistent disparities between countries. Of particular concern are the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and the countries in Central Asia and the Pacific. For example, the least developed countries have among the highest rates of child and maternal mortality in the world and are not making enough progress towards implementation of the Millennium Development Goals to reduce poverty and hunger and expand access to water and sanitation. While trade, transport and infrastructure continue to develop rapidly, in some parts of the region the development of infrastructure remains limited. Much work remains to be done to address the social and environmental impacts of such changes and deficiencies. In addition, further expansion of trade and regional integration is hampered by the multitude of bilateral and subregional trade agreements involving ESCAP member countries. 15.5 The Asian and Pacific region has witnessed rising inequalities over the past 15 years. Income disparities have led, inter alia, to serious social and environmental inequities. An increasing proportion of the poor in the region live in areas where the environment is under stress. In most countries, the poorest fifth of the population has a rate of access to sanitation that is less than 35 per cent of that of the richest fifth. The high levels of inequality are diminishing growth prospects and eroding social cohesion in the region. 15.6 Within this regional context, the overall objective of the programme will be to promote inclusive and sustainable economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific, with a particular focus on supporting member States in achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. 15.7 Acting in its dual role as a regional arm of the United Nations and as part of the institutional landscape in Asia and the Pacific, the Commission will continue to pursue the key objectives shared by all of the regional commissions, namely, to (a) foster economic integration at the subregional and regional levels; (b) promote the regional implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals; and (c) support regional sustainable development by helping to bridge economic, social and environmental gaps among member States and subregions, including through trade and transport. In order to achieve those objectives, all of the regional commissions will continue to generate multilateral dialogue, knowledge-sharing and networking and to work together to promote intraregional and interregional cooperation, both among themselves and through collaboration with other relevant organizations. 15.8 The preparation of the proposed biennial programme plan for the biennium 2010-2011 benefited from the outcome of the review of the Commission's conference structure, as mandated by the Commission in its resolutions 58/1, 61/1 and 63/3. The review, which will be submitted for the consideration of the Commission at its sixty-fourth session in April 2008, aims to promote a more effective system of governance based on the principles of greater effectiveness, accountability and ownership by member States. The review, which was facilitated by the Working Group on the Conference Structure of the Advisory Committee of Permanent Representatives and Other Representatives Designated by Members of the Commission, collected views from the full membership of ESCAP through survey questionnaires and a series of evaluations of past intergovernmental meetings conducted under the ESCAP conference structure. In addition, the review took into account the recommendations of an inspection carried out by the Office of Internal Oversight Services (E/ESCAP/64/30) and a series of evaluations of ESCAP, including an external evaluation undertaken in mid-2006, which was submitted to the Commission at its sixty-third session. The recommendations from the review reaffirmed the value of the Commission as an inclusive platform for the countries of the region to exchange views, experiences and information on major policies dealing with economic, social and environmental issues of common interest. The review also pointed to the need for ESCAP to sharpen the focus of its work, to strive for a more balanced approach to addressing the needs of its membership and to enhance cooperation with international and regional organizations, including those within the United Nations system, to ensure greater synergies and complementarity in its work. 15.9 While many subprogrammes of the proposed biennial programme plan for the biennium 2010-2011 reflect continuity in the direction of work already undertaken by ESCAP for the period 2008-2009, as a result of the above-mentioned review, a number of areas will receive greater emphasis during the period 2010-2011 in order to reflect the repositioning of the Commission as a leading regional hub for promoting cooperation among member States for the achievement of inclusive and sustainable economic and social development in Asia and the Pacific and in response to the Commission's call for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the external evaluation undertaken by ESCAP in 2006. 15.10 The proposed biennial programme plan comprises an integrated set of eight mutually supportive subprogramme areas, listed below, which are linked to the priorities of member States, in line with the new intergovernmental conference structure to be submitted to the Commission for its consideration at its sixty-fourth session. 15.11 The focus of the objectives and expected results of all subprogrammes has been sharpened by the addition of a clear regional dimension in order to demonstrate the value added by the work of ESCAP. 15.12 Poverty reduction and sustainable development will serve as overarching goals and will be integrated into the work of all subprogrammes of ESCAP. In that regard, renewed efforts will be made to mainstream gender concerns across all subprogrammes and to promote gender equality and the concerns of vulnerable groups as central to poverty reduction and inclusive and sustainable development. 15.13 The Commission will strive to become a leading regional authority on policy analysis of macroeconomic, social and environmental fundamentals for inclusive and sustainable development, including by analysing the range of good practices in the region in order to promote regional cooperation and the development of tools and strategic policy options to assist member States in making informed decisions on development challenges. Analysis of trends affecting the region's development and progress in the implementation of global mandates will facilitate common approaches to development issues and consensus-building, including regional inputs to global processes. 15.14 Based on its normative and analytical work, ESCAP will carry out technical cooperation to facilitate subregional and regional cooperation in areas of priority to member States, building on the work of the United Nations country teams in addressing key development challenges, for example, through pioneering innovative solutions and South-South cooperation. 15.15 Greater priority will be accorded to mainstreaming the concerns of countries with special needs in the Asian and Pacific region, including the 32 least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and countries with economies in transition, in order to promote their economic and social prosperity. Given the extreme diversity and geographical spread of the region, efforts will be made to increase the depth and impact of the work of the Commission in each of its subregions and to enhance the monitoring and evaluation of its work in these areas. 15.16 In view of the vulnerability of the Asian and Pacific region to disasters, greater priority will be accorded to work on disaster risk reduction and to the need for regional cooperation and inter-agency partnerships in addressing them. 15.17 Given the strength of ESCAP as the regional forum in Asia and the Pacific with universal membership and convening authority for intergovernmental dialogue, in particular on transboundary development issues, the Commission will work in close cooperation and coordination with other multilateral entities and specialized agencies, in particular the Asian Development Bank and subregional organizations. 15.18 The Commission will continue to engage with the Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs as a key global body for ensuring coherence on common thematic areas among entities of the United Nations Secretariat working in the social and economic sectors. Such consultations were held with regard to improving coordination and collaborative work in the formulation of the proposed biennial programme plan for 2010-2011. 15.19 In support of system-wide coherence, ESCAP, as chair of the United Nations regional coordination mechanism in Asia and the Pacific, will give special attention to strengthening coordination, cooperation and synergies among United Nations and other intergovernmental entities working towards the goal of "delivering as one" at the regional level. This will include working closely with entities of the United Nations Development Group to enhance the analytical, normative and operational linkages of the United Nations system to strengthen the Organization's development pillar.

Under the subprogramme, the secretariat would be responsible for mainstreaming the special needs of the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States throughout the work of ESCAP, especially in the areas of poverty reduction. The strategic underpinnings of the subprogramme are embedded in the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development, the 2005 World Summit Outcome, the mandate given by the Economic and Social Council to the Centre and ESCAP resolutions 62/1 and 63/4 on achieving the Millennium Development Goals in the region. 15.21 With its substantive focus on strengthening the capacities of countries to formulate and implement inclusive economic growth and development policies in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, the subprogramme would promote the sharing of knowledge on macroeconomic policy options and facilitate timely and effective regional responses to socio-economic vulnerabilities and external events and trends, including financing for development. Special emphasis would be placed on support towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, focusing on poverty reduction and gender equality issues, through adding value to national development strategies, processes and other efforts. To broaden the impact of its activities and support upscaling and replication, ESCAP would interact with other development partners, including other United Nations entities, with a view to fostering greater synergy in the areas of development policy issues, macroeconomic policy options and the Millennium Development Goals. Subprogramme 2 Trade and investment Objective of the Organization: to strengthen regional cooperation and integration in trade, investment, finance and technology transfer in the ESCAP region in support of inclusive and sustainable development (a) Strengthened regional cooperative mechanisms in trade, investment and finance (a) (i) Number of ESCAP member States indicating that regional cooperative mechanisms in trade, investment and finance fostered by ESCAP have been strengthened (ii) Increased coverage and depth of commitments under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement and/or the expansion of membership in the Agreement (b) Increased capacity of ESCAP member States to formulate and implement effective and coherent policies, including those with a gender dimension, on trade and investment, enterprise development and finance policies (b) Percentage of participants in ESCAP activities and initiatives indicating that they had increased and/or used their capacity to formulate or implement effective and mutually coherent and consistent trade and investment, enterprise development and finance policies, including those with a gender dimension (c) Increased capacity of ESCAP member States to formulate and implement policies and strategies for sustainable economic growth and rural poverty reduction through agrotechnology transfer and agro-based enterprise development (c) Percentage of those participating in the activities of the United Nations Asian and Pacific Centre for Agricultural Engineering and Machinery and other ESCAP initiatives indicating that they were better able to formulate or implement policies and strategies for sustainable economic growth and rural poverty reduction through regional cooperation in agrotechnology and agricultural enterprise development (d) Strengthened capacity to promote national innovative systems and create an enabling environment for technology transfer to address regional development challenges (d) Increased number of ESCAP member States participating in the Asian and Pacific Centre for Transfer of Technology and other technology transfer mechanisms promoted by ESCAP, including regional networks 15.22 The substantive responsibility for the subprogramme would lie with the Trade and Investment Division, with support from the Asian and Pacific Centre for Transfer of Technology and the United Nations Asian and Pacific Centre for Agricultural Engineering and Machinery. The strategic direction of the subprogramme is mainly derived from the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, the 2005 World Summit Outcome, the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries, the Shanghai Declaration, Economic and Social Council resolutions 2005/38, on the statute of the Asian and Pacific Centre for Transfer of Technology, and 2005/37, on the statute of the United Nations Asian and Pacific Centre for Agricultural Engineering and Machinery, and Commission resolution 62/6 on managing globalization through strengthened regional cooperation in trade and investment. 15.23 To meet its objectives, the subprogramme would be implemented through a combination of analytical and policy-oriented research, including capacity-building and promotion of technology transfer, and experience sharing and multi-stakeholder policy dialogues. Common frameworks that advance regional integration in trade, investment and finance, technology transfer and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, including agricultural enterprises, in a manner supportive of the multilateral trade system and other multilateral agreements of relevance would be pursued. The deepening, expansion and strengthening of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement would form a key pillar of the work, while regional cooperation among research institutions through the Asia-Pacific Research and Training Network on Trade and the expansion of the proposed Asia-Pacific forum for efficient trade as important regional cooperative mechanisms for facilitating trade would also be promoted. In the area of finance, emphasis would be placed on promoting regional cooperation and integration mechanisms to facilitate regional financial flows and the mobilization of finance for trade and investment. 15.24 The Commission would collaborate at the regional, subregional and national levels with the agencies of the United Nations system and with other bilateral and multilateral agencies. In particular, partnerships would be strengthened with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World Trade Organization in the area of trade; with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Trade Centre UNCTAD/WTO and the World Bank in the areas of investment, technology transfer and enterprise development; and with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank in the area of finance. Subprogramme 3 Transport Objective of the Organization: to promote regional cooperation and integration in transport for inclusive and sustainable development in the ESCAP region (a) Enhanced knowledge and increased capacity of member States to develop and implement effective and sustainable transport policies and programmes, including those targeting the Millennium Development Goals (a) (i) Increased number of Government policies, programmes, projects and initiatives that reflect ESCAP-promoted principles or recommendations in the areas of transport (ii) Increased percentage of delegations participating in ESCAP activities that indicate that they have enhanced their knowledge and capacity to develop and implement effective and sustainable transport policies and programmes (b) Improved capability of member States and international financial institutions to use the Asian Highway, Trans-Asian Railway and other ESCAP-promoted initiatives for planning international intermodal transport linkages (b) (i) Increased number of feasibility studies for investment projects and infrastructure improvements of intermodal connections on the Asian Highway and Trans-Asian Railway (ii) Increased number of accessions by ESCAP member States to global, regional and subregional agreements (c) Increased capacity among ESCAP member States and regional industries to implement measures to improve the efficiency and safety of international transport operations and logistics (c) (i) Increased number of initiatives to improve transport safety and identify and remove bottlenecks along transport routes and at selected border crossings (ii) Increased number of container block-trains and intermodal transport services scheduled on the Asian Highway and Trans-Asian Railway and along interregional routes 15.25 The substantive responsibility for this subprogramme would lie with the Transport Division. The strategic direction of the subprogramme would derive mainly from General Assembly resolutions 60/5, on improving global road safety, and 61/212, on the outcome of the International Ministerial Conference of Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries and International Financial and Development Institutions on Transit Transport Cooperation; Economic and Social Council resolution 2004/6, on the Shanghai Declaration; and ESCAP resolutions 60/4 on the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Asian Highway Network, 61/11 on the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action, 62/4 on the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Trans-Asian Railway Network and 63/9 on the implementation of the Busan Declaration on Transport Development in Asia and the Pacific and the Regional Action Programme for Transport Development in Asia and the Pacific, phase I (2007-2011). 15.26 The subprogramme would support the actions of ESCAP member States to develop balanced, efficient and integrated approaches to economic and social development that aims at an efficient international, integrated, intermodal transport and logistics system that supports the development of coastal areas, hinterlands and landlocked countries by providing physical and electronic access and connectivity. 15.27 During the biennium 2010-2011, the subprogramme would concentrate on further development of the Asian Highway and Trans-Asian Railway networks, including acting as secretariat for the intergovernmental agreements for the networks, which are deposited with the Secretary-General. The subprogramme would identify investment requirements and priorities, addressing non-physical bottlenecks, including those at border crossings, and would create an institutional environment to encourage the development of inland container depots or dry ports with links to seaports and airports. Strategies to promote the improvement of dry ports as economic growth poles, thus creating jobs and reducing poverty, would also be continued. Subprogramme 4 Environment and development Objective of the Organization: to improve the environmental sustainability of economic development and effective management of energy and water resources in the ESCAP region in order to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, in particular the Millennium Development Goals (a) Strengthened consensus among ESCAP member States on an increased number of issues related to environmentally sustainable economic growth (a) Number of outcome documents that show agreement among ESCAP member States on issues related to environmentally sustainable economic growth (b) Improved awareness and understanding among policymakers in planning, finance and other relevant ministries and stakeholders in the ESCAP region on effective policy and programme options for promoting environmentally sustainable economic growth (b) Percentage of participants in ESCAP activities indicating that they have an improved awareness and understanding of effective policy and programme options (c) Improved capacity of ESCAP member States to develop policy and programme options, including those with a poverty and gender dimension for promoting environmentally sustainable economic growth (c) Percentage of participants in ESCAP activities who indicate that their level of competency in developing policies and programmes, including those with a poverty and gender dimension, has increased (d) Increased national capacity of ESCAP member States in formulating effective policies and strategies on the management and use of energy and water resources (d) Increased percentage of participants in ESCAP activities who indicate that their level of competency in effective management and use of energy and water resources has increased 15.28 The substantive responsibility for the subprogramme would lie with the Environment and Development Division. The strategic direction of the subprogramme is mainly derived from the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the 2005 World Summit Outcome, the outcomes of other major United Nations conferences and international agreements related to environment and development since 1992, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, the Shanghai Declaration and Commission resolution 61/9 on the fifth Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development in Asia and the Pacific, 2005. 15.29 The subprogramme would focus on using innovative and pragmatic approaches to promote inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth and to support regional cooperation on environmental protection, environmentally sustainable management of energy and water resources, improved access to safe drinking water and the improved environmental performance of major stakeholders. Given the heightened concern about energy security and its strong linkage to and synergies with climate change mitigation, focus would be placed on the promotion of energy security and energy for sustainable development. 15.30 The subprogramme would assist member States of ESCAP to develop and apply inclusive and sustainable policies and programmes, in particular those aimed at attaining Millennium Development Goals 1 and 7, and would promote the wider participation of all stakeholders, including civil society organizations, in regional and national decision-making processes relating to environmentally sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, the subprogramme would seek to supplement the efforts of member States to meet the challenges related to energy security and sustainable development through analysis and promotion of strengthened cooperation on energy matters at the subregional and regional levels. Priority would be accorded to collaboration with other United Nations agencies and international organizations in the development of tools and networks to support the above initiatives. Subprogramme 5 Information and communications technology and disaster risk reduction Objective of the Organization: to strengthen regional cooperation for the improved management of disasters and associated socio-economic risks and to promote application of information and communications technology for socio-economic development in the ESCAP region (a) Increased sharing of knowledge among ESCAP member States on policy options, strategies and best practices for information and communications technology (ICT) connectivity and for integrating multi-hazard disaster risk reduction into national development (a) (i) Increased percentage of those participating in ESCAP activities on ICT connectivity and disaster risk reduction who indicate that knowledge-sharing within the region has increased (ii) Increased number of policy practices in multi-hazard disaster risk reduction collected, documented, analysed and disseminated by ESCAP to member States (b) Strengthened regional cooperative mechanisms in support of ICT connectivity and disaster risk management (b) (i) Increased number of ESCAP member States taking measures to enhance regional cooperative mechanisms promoted by ESCAP in support of ICT connectivity (ii) Increased number of ESCAP member States actively participating in regional cooperative mechanisms for disaster risk management fostered by ESCAP (c) Improved capabilities of ESCAP member States in the field of multi-hazard assessment, preparedness, early warning and response to disaster risks (c) Increased percentage of ESCAP member States participating in ESCAP activities that indicate that they are better able to assess, prepare for and respond to disaster risks (d) Improved institutional capacity of ESCAP member States to apply ICT for socio-economic development (d) Increased percentage of participants benefiting from the work of the Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information and Communication Technology for Development and from other ESCAP initiatives, including an increase in the number who indicate that they are better able to apply ICT for socio-economic development 15.31 The substantive responsibility for the subprogramme would lie with the Information and Communications Technology and Disaster Risk Reduction Division. The strategic direction for the subprogramme is mainly derived from the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction, which resulted in the adoption of the Hyogo Declaration and the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters, and from General Assembly resolution 60/252 on the World Summit on the Information Society. Following the World Conference on Disaster Reduction, the Assembly, in its resolution 59/233, called for close cooperation and coordination among Governments, the United Nations system, regional organizations and others in the area of natural disasters and vulnerability. Commission resolution 62/2, containing the Jakarta Declaration on enhancing regional cooperation in infrastructure development, including that related to disaster management, and resolution 62/7 on strengthening regional cooperation and coordination of early warning system arrangements for tsunamis, recast the preceding global mandates as a framework for action in the Asian and Pacific region. In addition, Economic and Social Council resolution 2005/40 on the establishment of the Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information and Communication Technology for Development and Commission resolution 62/5 on building the information society in Asia and the Pacific, provide the framework for the direction for the subprogramme. The subprogramme would seek to strengthen that framework as the basis for a regional forum on consensus-building for action and an effective mechanism to contribute to the global mandates. 15.32 The subprogramme would improve the capabilities of ESCAP members in this field with the aim of reducing the socio-economic impact of disasters, natural and otherwise, as appropriate. The subprogramme would focus on filling gaps in disaster preparedness, particularly in the promotion of regional multi-hazard early warning systems, by building on the comparative advantage of ESCAP within existing subregional mechanisms for tropical cyclone-related disasters in ongoing efforts for the development of mechanisms on tsunami and multi-hazard early warning and regional cooperative mechanisms for easy access to and effective use of space-based technical tools. It is a long-term goal of the Secretariat to contribute through the activities under this subprogramme to the Asia-Pacific components of a comprehensive worldwide multi-hazard disaster management and early-warning system that balances technical, cooperative institutional and participatory community approaches to disaster risk reduction. 15.33 The subprogramme would emphasize knowledge generation and knowledge-sharing and strengthen the abilities of decision makers to create more disaster risk resilient societies. It would emphasize disaster awareness and response, including through strengthened risk assessment, planning, prevention, mitigation, preparedness and early warning capabilities in a comprehensive multi-hazard management approach. Special attention would be paid to meeting the special needs of vulnerable groups and contributing to poverty reduction and gender equality. Regional cooperation and capacity-building would also be emphasized to mitigate the effects of disasters on people and infrastructure so that disasters do not divert resources from sustainable development. 15.34 The subprogramme would promote regional cooperation and partnerships for improved information and communications technology connectivity with a focus on policy harmonization, infrastructure development and ICT capacity-building. In order to realize the goal of a people-centred information society in Asia and the Pacific, the expansion of access and further deepening of ICT usage will be promoted, especially among the least developed countries and other countries with special needs. The efforts will be further augmented by ICT capacity-building initiatives conducted by the Asian and Pacific Training Centre. The capacity built among key ICT stakeholders will help optimize the usage of ICT infrastructure and the development of ICT applications for socio-economic development. As a strategy, the subprogramme will foster interdivisional cooperation and collaborate with other relevant intergovernmental organizations and existing regional mechanisms to address ICT connectivity and capacity-building, and provide member States with high-quality analysis and policy options. 15.35 To implement the subprogramme's activities more effectively and to avoid duplication of effort, strategic partnerships would be built with other United Nations entities and national and regional stakeholders, including the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Asia-Pacific Telecommunity and other relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system, development banks, regional and subregional institutions, and civil society and private sector organizations. Subprogramme 6 Social development Objective of the Organization: to strengthen cooperation in the ESCAP region in order that member States may build more inclusive societies through social and financial policies and measures that promote social protection and development (a) Effective facilitation of regional reviews to assess progress, address gaps, identify and build consensus on priority areas for action in the implementation of commitments agreed at United Nations intergovernmental processes pertaining to social development, population, ageing, disability, gender equality and health (a) Increased percentage of participants who indicate that activities organized by ESCAP to review the implementation of global mandates are relevant and useful, and that their agreed outcomes reflect regional concerns and priorities (b) Enhanced awareness of policy options, strategies and good practices in social policy and protection, including those with a focus on poverty reduction (b) (i) Increased number of analytical studies on policy options, strategies and good practices produced by ESCAP and made available to member States (ii) Increased demand for ESCAP information on policy, practice, analysis and data products available at the Division's website (c) Strengthened capacity and increased technical cooperation among ESCAP member States in developing and implementing social policies and financing aimed at building inclusive societies, reducing poverty and promoting gender equality (c) (i) Increased percentage of participants in activities organized by ESCAP who indicate that the knowledge and policy tools provided are relevant and useful for building inclusive societies, reducing poverty and promoting gender equality (ii) Increased number of gender- responsive technical cooperation initiatives among member States facilitated by ESCAP 15.36 The substantive responsibility for the subprogramme would lie with the Social Development Division. The strategic direction of the subprogramme emanates from the commitments agreed upon at relevant United Nations intergovernmental processes, including the World Summit for Social Development, the International Conference on Population and Development, the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, and the International Conference on Financing for Development. Regional mandates guiding the direction of the subprogramme include the Biwako Millennium Framework for Action towards an Inclusive, Barrier-free and Rights-based Society for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women also provides direction for the subprogramme. The work of the subprogramme on social policy relating to population, ageing and social protection issues would also be guided by, respectively, the Plan of Action on Population and Poverty adopted at the Fifth Asian and Pacific Population Conference, the Macao Plan of Action on Ageing for Asia and the Pacific and General Assembly resolution 62/133 on the intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women. 15.37 The subprogramme is aimed at strengthening capacity and regional cooperation among ESCAP member States in designing, implementing and monitoring social policies and institutional frameworks aimed at achieving inclusive societies and reducing poverty. It would promote research and analysis of key emerging development issues, such as international migration, that have social dimensions and regional ramifications. The subprogramme would employ multipronged approaches, including gender-responsive and rights-based approaches, the facilitation of partnerships with a range of stakeholders, including with non-governmental organizations and civil society, and the promotion of close collaboration and coordination with other United Nations entities to achieve inclusive social development. It would also build multisectoral partnerships with other divisions of ESCAP with a view to promoting economic prosperity, social progress and environmental sustainability in an integrated manner. Subprogramme 7 Statistics Objective of the Organization: to increase the use of statistics for evidence-based decision-making and foster the development and dissemination of key demographic, social, economic and environmental statistics in the ESCAP region (a) Increased understanding and capacity to assess key socio-economic trends in the ESCAP region, especially progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, by national official statisticians, decision makers and the public (a) Percentage of national statisticians and decision makers who indicate that they found ESCAP analytical outputs relevant and useful for monitoring key socio-economic trends and making decisions on related policies (b) Increased access by decision makers and the public to comparable data on key demographic, social, economic and environmental indicators for the ESCAP region (b) Increased access to online statistical data provided by ESCAP (c) Increased capacity of ESCAP member States to produce comparable and gender-disaggregated data in accordance with internationally agreed standards and good practices (c) Percentage of participants in relevant ESCAP activities who indicate that they were able to apply the knowledge gained in improving the provision of comparable and gender-disaggregated data (d) Strengthened capacity of national statistical offices in the ESCAP region to produce, disseminate and analyse data in accordance with internationally agreed standards and good practices (d) Increased percentage of trainees at the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific who indicate that they are better able to take measures to improve the quality of data and services provided by national statistical systems 15.38 The substantive responsibility for the subprogramme lies with the Statistics Division, with support from the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific. The strategic direction of the subprogramme derives mainly from the United Nations Millennium Declaration adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/2, and the 2005 World Summit Outcome adopted by the Assembly in its resolution 60/1, in particular as they relate to the monitoring of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. Mandates are also provided by Economic and Social Council resolutions 2005/13 on the 2010 World Population and Housing Census Programme, 2005/36 on the statute of the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific and 2006/6 on strengthening statistical capacity, and by Commission resolution 62/10 on strengthening statistical capacity in Asia and the Pacific. The objective of the subprogramme would be achieved through a balanced combination of normative, analytical and technical cooperation activities to improve the production and dissemination, by national statistical systems, of key demographic, social, economic and environmental statistics, gender-disaggregated where relevant, including the Millennium Development Goal indicators, and to promote their use by policymakers and the public in the Asian and Pacific region, in accordance with internationally agreed standards and good practices. 15.39 During the biennium 2010-2011, the subprogramme would continue to (a) promote the use of statistics for evidence-based decision-making; (b) support the development of economic, social and environmental statistics in the Asian and Pacific region; and (c) facilitate the implementation of existing and new international standards, including the new economic and social classifications and the revised system of national accounts. In particular, the subprogramme would focus on improving the availability and quality of data for measuring progress, particularly on social inclusion and gender equality. In addition, the subprogramme would further strengthen data dissemination through the issuance of publications and the provision of online databases to countries in the ESCAP region. The subprogramme would also increase its data support to, and collaboration with, other ESCAP subprogrammes in producing analytical outputs of the Secretariat through, inter alia, the provision of a common database, statistical publications and advisory services in statistical and econometric analysis. 15.40 To enhance coherence across the United Nations system and coordination among international agencies, ESCAP would work in close cooperation with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat and other relevant United Nations entities, development banks and funds, regional and subregional organizations and other statistical partners and networks. In particular, data collection would be coordinated with other international agencies and regional commissions, in accordance with relevant mandates.

from the existing ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre and four subregional offices in East and North-East Asia, North and Central Asia, South and South-West Asia and South-East Asia, the establishment of which has been proposed to the General Assembly in the report of the Secretary-General on improving the effective and efficient delivery of mandates of development-related activities and revised estimates relating to the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 (A/62/708, paras. 323 and 324). This subprogramme is proposed in order to ensure that the specific priority concerns of all five ESCAP subregions are effectively and equitably addressed. 15.42 The mandate and strategic direction of the subprogramme are mainly derived from the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, the 2005 World Summit Outcome, the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the Almaty Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy on the sustainable development of small island developing States. 15.43 Given the vast coverage and diversity of the Asian and Pacific region, the subprogramme would strengthen the Commission's presence and interventions at the subregional level, enabling better targeting and delivery of programmes that address specific key priorities, including poverty reduction and sustainable development, of member States in the respective subregions. The subprogramme would provide more focused and in-depth technical assistance to address key development challenges, including capacity-building activities, through the provision, on request, of advisory services, the organization of training workshops and the implementation of field projects. 15.44 The subprogramme would serve as a catalyst to operationalize the analytical and normative work of ESCAP at the subregional and national levels. Knowledge sharing and networking, including the dissemination of good practices for adaptation, experience sharing and replication, will be emphasized. A central part of the strategy would be to enhance partnerships with other United Nations agencies, as well as other development partners, including civil society, at the subregional and national levels, in order to support the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals.
