UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/629 1 June 1999 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 30 MAY 1999 FROM THE CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES A.I. OF THE PERMANENT MISSION OF YUGOSLAVIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL I have been instructed by my Government to inform you that on 22 May 1999 at 6.15 p.m., 10 members of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) provoked a border incident by entering the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 100 metres deep from Bosnia and Herzegovina in the region of Orljaca, 15 kilometres west of Pluzine, and opening fire against the Yugoslav organs guarding the border. The fire was returned, whereupon the members of SFOR retreated to the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, leaving the area in an armoured personnel carrier in the direction of Gacko. The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia rightly expects the Security Council to condemn this act of gross violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a sovereign and independent country and a Member State of the United Nations and to take appropriate measures to prevent its repetition. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Vladislav JOVANOVIC Chargé d'affaires a.i.
