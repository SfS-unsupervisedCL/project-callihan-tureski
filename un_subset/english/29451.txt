Annan Letter dated 13 August 2004 from the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization addressed to the Secretary-General In accordance with Security Council resolution 1088 (1996), I attach the monthly report on SFOR operations for June 2004.

In addition, there were 25 SFOR personnel posted in Croatia. 3. On 1 June 2004, SFOR multinational brigades were designated multinational task forces, in accordance with the restructuring of SFOR into a deterrent presence posture and associated downsizing of the forces engaged in the area of operations. 4. There was no change to the status of partner/non-NATO country contributions. Istanbul Summit decisions 5. At the Istanbul Summit on 28 June 2004, NATO allies agreed to bring the SFOR mission to a successful conclusion by the end of the year. The leaders also welcomed the readiness of the European Union to deploy a new and distinct United Nations-mandated Chapter VII mission in the country, based on the Berlin plus arrangements agreed between NATO and the European Union. NATO leaders also agreed to establish a NATO headquarters at Sarajevo, with the principal task of providing advice on defence reform, and which will also undertake certain operational supporting tasks, such as counter-terrorism, while ensuring force protection; supporting the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, within means and capabilities, with regard to the detention of persons indicted for war crimes; and intelligence sharing with the European Union. The Secretary-General of NATO and the High Representative of the European Union for the Common Foreign and Security Policy met bilaterally to discuss the arrangements for implementing these decisions. 6. Although Bosnia and Herzegovina was extended an invitation to the Istanbul Summit as an observer and attended the Euro-Atlantic Partnership council events in that capacity, the country was not offered membership in the Alliance's Partnership for Peace, on account of the insufficient cooperation with the International Tribunal due in particular to obstructionist elements in the Republika Srpska.

The new organization includes three combat-ready brigades, robust reserve components, training and logistics commands, and air and air defence assets. The proposed reorganization will reflect the smaller numbers of forces, leaving the division as the highest command reporting to the entity organizational Chief of Staff. 22.

The summer demining cycle is now in full swing, with four demining cycles already completed this year. The weather has enabled most tasks to start as planned and the work is going well.
