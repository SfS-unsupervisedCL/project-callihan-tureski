exceptional circumstances, Recalling its resolution 1995/51 of 3 March 1995, Taking into account Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities resolution 1995/7 of 18 August 1995, Having considered the reports of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (E/CN.4/1996/38 and Add.1) and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions (E/CN.4/1996/4), Having considered also the report of the independent expert, Mrs. Mónica Pinto (E/CN.4/1996/15), and studied the conclusions and recommendations contained therein, Taking into account the four reports submitted by the United Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights and of Compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights in

Government, such as the dismissal of some high-ranking military officers and a large number of members of the security forces, with a view to combating impunity and guaranteeing full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone in Guatemala, Concerned nevertheless by the fact that, despite those reforms, there continue to be serious human rights violations in Guatemala, attributed to members of the armed forces and security forces and to the so-called voluntary civil self-defence committees, whereas it cannot be affirmed that those violations are a consequence of an existing policy of the current Government systematically to violate human rights, Concerned also by the fact that situations of impunity continue to exist and that, in cases of human rights violations, there has not been sufficient progress in the investigations and/or judicial proceedings, Regretting the human rights violations, marginalization and centuries-old discrimination that have been suffered by the indigenous populations in Guatemala, Regretting also that the process of the return of refugees and the resettlement of displaced persons has encountered serious problems, in particular the massacre in the community of "Aurora, 8 de octubre" in Xamán, municipality of Chisec, on 5 October 1995, which constitutes the most significant violation of the human rights of returnees in Guatemala, and recognizing the measures taken by the Government of Guatemala which resulted in the soldiers involved being brought to trial before the competent civil judge, the dismissal of the local detachment commander and the resignation of the Minister of Defence, Considering that the economic and social situation continues to have serious consequences for the great majority of the population, particularly for the indigenous peoples of Guatemala and the most vulnerable sectors of Guatemalan society, Taking note with great satisfaction of the historic Agreement on Identity

the decision of the previous Government of Guatemala to suspend obligatory military service and to order the demobilization of the paramilitary officers (comisionados militares), Recognizing the importance of the general elections which were held in November 1995 and January 1996, with the participation, for the first time since 1950, of sectors that had been traditionally marginalized from the political life of the country, and which led to the inauguration of a new Government on 14 January 1996, to the formation of a Congress and to the installation of new local governments which are more representative of the interests of the population, Encouraged by the fact that the new Government of Guatemala has given immediate attention to various problems related to violations of human rights and to impunity, as well as to continuity in the process of negotiation in an effort to establish a firm and lasting peace, Equally encouraged by the fact that the Government of Guatemala and the URNG General Command have restarted the process of negotiation, with the intention of resolving the remaining substantive issues in the shortest possible time in order to end that process with the signing of a firm and lasting peace agreement within the current year, Even more encouraged by the declaration of the URNG General Command, on 19 March 1996, on the temporary suspension of offensive military operations, attacks on garrisons, detachments and military installations and the deployment of troops on the roads, and by the corresponding declaration of the Government of Guatemala, on 20 March 1996, issuing instructions to the army of Guatemala to cease their counter-insurgent operations and undertake solely those activities prescribed by their constitutional mandate, Recognizing the importance of the role played in these negotiations by the moderator appointed by the Secretary-General, of the participation of the Group of Friendly Countries composed of Colombia, Spain, the United States of America, Mexico, Norway and Venezuela, and of the valuable contributions of the Civil-Society Assembly, on the terms established in the Framework Agreement, Also recognizing the positive role played by MINUGUA for the benefit of the peace process in carrying out its work of verifying the human rights situation and compliance with the Commitments of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights, Considering that it is necessary for the international community to continue to keep the human rights situation in Guatemala under review and to provide advisory services in the field of human rights to the Government and to non-governmental organizations, as well as technical and financial assistance for both, with the aim of promoting full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms

the International Covenants on Human Rights and to other international human rights instruments, Recalling Security Council resolution 688 (1991) of 5 April 1991, in which the Council demanded an end to the repression of the Iraqi civilian population and insisted that Iraq cooperate with humanitarian organizations to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens were respected, Recalling also Security Council resolutions 706 (1991) of 15 August 1991, 712 (1991) of 19 September 1991 and 778 (1992) of 2 October 1992, Recalling further Security Council resolution 986 (1995) of 14 April 1995, by which the Council authorized States to permit imports of Iraqi oil up to the amount of 1 billion United States dollars every 90 days, on a renewable basis, to be used to purchase essential food and medical supplies for humanitarian purposes, and welcoming the acceptance by the Government of Iraq of the Secretary-General's invitation to enter into discussion on this issue with the United Nations Secretariat, Recalling in particular its resolution 1991/74 of 6 March 1991, in which the Commission requested its Chairman to appoint a special rapporteur to make a thorough study of the violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq, based on all information the Special Rapporteur might deem relevant, including information provided by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and any comments and material provided by the Government of Iraq, Recalling also its pertinent resolutions condemning the flagrant violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq, including resolution 1992/71 of 5 March 1992, in which it requested the Special Rapporteur to continue to pursue his mandate and to visit again the northern area of Iraq in

session in the light of additional elements provided by the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council, Deeply concerned at the persisting massive and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq, regarding which there are no signs of improvement, such as summary and arbitrary executions, the enactment and implementation of decrees prescribing cruel and inhuman punishments, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, arbitrary arrests and detentions, lack of due process, non-respect for the rule of law and the suppression of freedom of thought,

formal request of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq to visit Iraq, that there is now little in the way of even formal cooperation extended to the Special Rapporteur by the Government of Iraq and in particular that full replies have still not been given to the many questions the Special Rapporteur has put to the Government of Iraq in previous years, Expressing concern at the exceptional gravity of the human rights situation in Iraq and, therefore, endorsing the Special Rapporteur's repeated proposals for the deployment of a team of human rights monitors and for the sending of human rights monitors to such locations as would facilitate improved information flow and assessment and would help in the independent verification of reports on the situation of human rights in Iraq, Welcoming in that respect the sending of two fact-finding missions in order to obtain supplementary information and testimonies from Iraqi citizens who recently fled Iraq, victims of severe human rights violations for which the Government of Iraq has general responsibility under international law, 1.

Calls once again upon Iraq, as a State party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to abide by its freely undertaken obligations under the Covenants and under other international instruments on human rights, and particularly to respect and ensure the rights of all individuals, irrespective of their origin, within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction; 6. Demands that the Government of Iraq: (a) Bring the actions of its military and security forces into conformity with the standards of international law, in particular those of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; (b) Restore the independence of the judiciary and abrogate all laws granting impunity to specified forces or persons killing or injuring individuals for any purpose beyond the administration of justice under the rule of law as prescribed by international standards; (c) Abrogate all decrees that prescribe cruel and inhuman punishment or treatment and take every step necessary to ensure that all persons arbitrarily detained are immediately released and that the practice of torture and cruel and unusual punishments and treatment no longer occurs; (d) Abrogate also all laws and procedures, including Revolution Command Council Decree No. 840, of 4 November 1986, that penalize the free expression of competing views and ideas, and to ensure that the genuine will of the people shall be the basis of authority in the State; (e) Having sole responsibility in this regard, remove the internal embargo on the northern region, which permits essentially no exceptions for humanitarian needs, eliminate its discriminatory practices restricting access to food and health care in the southern region and cooperate with international humanitarian agencies in the provision of relief to those in need throughout Iraq; (f) Cease immediately its repressive practices aimed at the Iraqi Kurds and other minorities, as well as the population of the southern marsh area, cooperate in the identification of minefields existing throughout Iraq with a view to facilitating their marking and eventual clearing and cooperate with international aid agencies to provide humanitarian assistance in the northern and southern areas of the country; 7.

At the 62nd meeting, on 24 April 1996, the Chairman made the following statement in connection with draft decision E/CN.4/1996/L.2: "In the course of the current session delegations have expressed the view that a more concerted and systematic effort should be made to ensure that decisions of the Commission are taken on the basis of the broadest possible support and, whenever possible, without a vote. Resolutions and decisions adopted by consensus not only carry more weight, morally and politically, as representing the position of the entire membership, but they also are often more effective in engaging the cooperation of the States and parties concerned in looking for durable solutions of human rights issues. "Preference for consensus does not mean a change of the rules of procedure of the Commission nor the elimination of voting as an acceptable way of taking decisions when there clearly is no possibility of reaching consensus. "Transparency with regard to all initiatives, including draft resolutions and decisions, as well as amendments, is a recognized procedure for facilitating dialogue and understanding between interested delegations and groups and reducing the level of confrontation and politicization of the Commission. At the current session there has been an increased effort towards more openness and dialogue among delegations, resulting in the adoption of resolutions and decisions by consensus. "After consultations with interested delegations, the Chairman wishes to express his satisfaction that there is a general agreement with regard to the need to continue efforts for promoting consensus, dialogue and transparency and with a view to reducing the level of politicization of the Commission. These efforts could be facilitated by holding frequent informal meetings among delegations of different groups between sessions as well as during sessions. "It is my understanding that the co-sponsors of the draft decision contained in document E/CN.4/1996/L.2 would not insist on action on the draft decision this year." 22. The representative of Sri Lanka made a statement on behalf of the sponsors of draft decision E/CN.4/1996/L.2, proposing the deferral of consideration of the draft decision until the fifty-third session of the Commission. 23. The Commission decided, without a vote, to defer consideration of draft decision E/CN.4/1996/L.2 until its fifty-third session. For the text of the decision as adopted, see chapter II, section B, decision 1996/114. Situation of human rights in Colombia 24. At the 60th meeting, on 23 April 1996, the Chairman made the following statement on the situation of human rights in Colombia: "The Commission on Human Rights is deeply concerned that the situation of endemic violence affecting many parts of the country and the confrontation between government and guerrilla groups have resulted in serious consequences for human rights in the country. "The Commission on Human Rights acknowledges the efforts carried out by the Government in the field of human rights and its willingness to cooperate with the special rapporteurs and working groups; welcomes the collaboration provided by the Government of Colombia to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights during the visit he paid to the country last year; and notes the establishment of a follow-up commission in charge of analysing and promoting the fulfilment of recommendations of the United Nations thematic rapporteurs and working groups, as well as of other international and regional organizations. "The Commission on Human Rights is, however, deeply concerned about violations of the right to life, as extensively evidenced in the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. Thousands of lives are lost every year as a result of various acts of violence, especially in the context of the armed conflict between the Government and the guerrillas, as well as by the action of paramilitary groups. Such conflict entails serious and continuous abuses and violations of humanitarian law by both State agents and guerrilla groups, the latter persisting in prohibited practices such as the taking of civilian hostages. "The Commission on Human Rights acknowledges that the Government of Colombia has taken steps for the application of humanitarian standards in the conflict, inter alia by an agreement with the International Committee of the Red Cross to facilitate its humanitarian activities in the country. "The Commission on Human Rights remains deeply preoccupied by the large number of cases of disappearances, as shown in the report of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. The application at the national level of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance faces several obstacles, generating impunity. "The Commission on Human Rights, while taking note of the intention manifested by the Government of Colombia to undertake efforts in order to enhance the rule of law, calls for the urgent adoption of more effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in accordance with article 3 of the Declaration. "The Commission on Human Rights remains concerned about the alarming level of impunity, in particular concerning abuses by State agents that presently fall under the jurisdiction of military courts; it encourages the Government of Colombia to continue and conclude the process of reform of the military penal code in accordance with the recommendations made by the thematic rapporteur, in particular as far as the exclusion from the jurisdiction of military courts of crimes against humanity is concerned. It takes note of the establishment of a human rights unit in the Office of the National Prosecutor with competence to investigate and indict State agents, guerrillas and members of paramilitary groups responsible for violations of human rights or humanitarian law. "The Commission on Human Rights is deeply concerned also about the persistence of the practice of torture. The report of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture shows that the steps taken by the Government of Colombia have not resulted in a tangible improvement of the overall situation, and that the crime of torture is hardly punished. The information before the Committee against Torture indicates that the law in Colombia is not yet in accordance with several obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. "The Commission on Human Rights urges the Government of Colombia to continue strengthening ordinary justice versus special systems of justice, the misuse of which can lead to serious violations of human rights. The competence of the courts of regional jurisdiction should be limited, and should in no instance be applied to acts of legitimate political dissent and social protest. In no instance should defendants before regional courts be denied a fair trial. "The Commission on Human Rights - while encouraging the work of the special commission set up by the Government of Colombia for the follow-up and implementation of the recommendations of the thematic rapporteurs - considers that the implementation of such recommendations and those of working groups is still not sufficient and that the human rights situation has not improved significantly, and recalls the resolution adopted by the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities in August 1995. "The Commission on Human Rights requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to proceed, upon the initiative of the Government of Colombia and the identification of adequate sources of financing, to establish at the earliest possible date a permanent office in Colombia with the mandate to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights and to observe violations of human rights in the country, making analytical reports to the High Commissioner; it requests the High Commissioner to report to the Commission at its fifty-third session on the setting up of the office and on the activities carried out by it in implementing the above mandate." Situation of human rights in Liberia 25. At the 62nd meeting, on 24 April 1996, the Chairman made the following statement on the situation of human rights in Liberia: "The Commission on Human Rights, meeting in Geneva from 18 March to 26 April 1996, views with grave concern the deterioration of the political, economic and social situation in Liberia. It deplores the indiscriminate destruction of life, limb and property which has necessitated, inter alia, the evacuation of foreign nationals, including United Nations personnel and that of humanitarian agencies, from Liberia. "The Commission further considers it unacceptable that, in spite of the various agreements signed by the warring factions committing themselves to a cease-fire and the pursuit of an agreed peace process, there is an increasing resort to arms in the settlement of differences. "In view of the adverse consequences of this situation on the enjoyment of human rights by the people of Liberia, the Commission calls upon all the Liberian parties to respect and implement fully and expeditiously all the agreements and commitments they have already entered into, in particular the provisions of the Abuja Agreement with regard to the maintenance of the cease-fire, disarmament and demobilization of combatants and national reconciliation. "In this regard, the Commission also wishes to recall all previous Security Council resolutions concerning the situation in Liberia, in particular resolution 1041 (1996) of 29 January 1996, and appeals to all actors to multiply their efforts with a view to bringing the warring factions to live up to their commitments and to exercise the utmost restraint in the interest of peace. "The Commission calls upon all States of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to provide Liberia with technical and financial assistance to cope with the humanitarian situation and to provide the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) with the necessary logistical and financial support to enable it to carry out its mandate, particularly with respect to disarmament of the Liberian factions. "The Commission decides to remain seized of the matter." Organization of work of the fifty-third session of the Commission 26.

Takes due note of the fifth report submitted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (E/CN.4/1996/40); "2. Requests the Working Group to take duly into account in the exercise of the functions conferred upon it by the Economic and Social Council in its decision 1991/243 of 31 May 1991 the clear differentiation existing in both United Nations parlance and practical action between the situations of 'detention' and 'imprisonment', as established by the General Assembly in resolution 43/173 of 9 December 1988; "3. Also requests the Working Group, when analysing the admissibility of a complaint against a State and/or the applicability of the provisions of a human rights instrument to a particular human rights situation, also to take duly into account whether such instrument is only a standard of a purely recommendatory nature or a contractual legal instrument establishing juridical obligations for the State concerned and, in the latter case, whether such obligations are applicable to the said State as a party to that particular legal instrument; "4. Further requests the Working Group to reassess the appropriateness of substituting an approach based on cooperation for its present 'adversarial' method of work which, in fact, propitiates unnecessary confrontations between the Working Group and States concerned; "5. Requests the Working Group to revise further its present methods of work, as summarized in annex I to its report, so as to make them compatible with the guidelines established in the present resolution; "6. Also requests the Working Group to report to the Commission at its fifty-third session on the steps taken to implement the present resolution." 161.

"The Commission recalls the undertakings by the Government of Indonesia to promote human rights in East Timor and those contained in Chairman's statements on the matter at previous sessions. The Commission stresses the need to take further steps towards their implementation, including the early release of the East Timorese detained or convicted and further clarification of the circumstances surrounding the Dili incident of 1991. "The Commission notes with satisfaction the greater access recently granted by the Indonesian authorities to the international media and humanitarian organizations and trusts that it will be expanded further to human rights organizations. "The Commission welcomes the visit to East Timor by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. José Ayala Lasso, on 6 December 1995, and stresses the importance of this visit in the context of the Chairman's statement at the previous session. The Commission notes with satisfaction the understanding reached between the Indonesian authorities and the High Commissioner concerning the upgrading of the current Memorandum of Intent on technical cooperation in the field of human rights, signed in Jakarta on 26 October 1994, into a memorandum of understanding. In this context, it was also provisionally agreed to look into the possibility of the High Commissioner assigning a programme officer within the office of the United Nations Development Programme in Jakarta to follow up the implementation of the technical cooperation agreement. This officer would also have regular access to East Timor. "The Commission welcomes the intention of the Government of Indonesia to continue to cooperate with the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms, as well as its intention to invite a thematic rapporteur in 1997. "The Commission welcomes the result of the seventh round of the tripartite dialogue between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and Portugal on the question of East Timor under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, held in London on 16 January 1996, and encourages the Secretary-General to continue his good offices in order to achieve a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the question of East Timor. "The Commission welcomes the informal bilateral meeting between President Suharto and Prime Minister Guterres at the Asia-Europe Meeting in Bangkok on 29 February 1996 and expresses the hope that it will contribute positively to the ongoing tripartite dialogue. The Commission also welcomes the holding of the all-inclusive intra-East Timorese dialogue in Burg Schlaining, Austria, from 19 to 22 March 1996.

At the 61st meeting, on 24 April 1996, the Chairman made the following statement on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation: "The Commission on Human Rights, having examined the report of the Secretary-General (E/CN.4/1996/13) of 26 March 1996 and its addendum (E/CN.4/1996/13/Add.1) of 22 April 1996, recalls its Chairman's statement of 1995 in connection with the grave situation of human rights in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation. The Commission is deeply concerned that, in spite of its urgent call, the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces, resulting in high numbers of civilian casualties, is continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights, as well as of international humanitarian law. "The Commission remains deeply preoccupied with the continued fighting and notes that, despite the latest peace initiative by President Yeltsin, a lasting cease-fire has not been carried out on the ground. Accordingly, the Commission strongly deplores the high numbers of victims and the suffering inflicted on the civilian population and on displaced persons who are subjected to the effects of the armed confrontation. Severe destruction of Chechen towns and villages with consequent displacement of a large proportion of the civilian population is a conspicuous feature of military actions in the Republic this year as in 1995. In this context, the Commission calls for an immediate and permanent cessation of the bombardment of civilian towns and villages that is still continuing. The Commission strongly deplores this and the serious destruction of installations and infrastructure used by civilians. It condemns all violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law and calls for all those who have committed violations of human rights and other crimes to be brought to justice. "The Commission on Human Rights urges the parties concerned to respect fully the principles of international law and calls urgently for an immediate and lasting cessation of hostilities, violations of human rights and other acts of violence, convinced that political dialogue and effective negotiations are the only means to achieve a genuine and lasting settlement. The Commission calls for immediate contacts between representatives of the parties with the aim of finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, consistent with respect for the territorial integrity and the Constitution of the Russian Federation. It further reiterates that the fundamental human rights of the people of the Republic of Chechnya should be upheld, and calls for the holding of free and democratic elections in due time. "The Commission on Human Rights stresses the important role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and its assistance group, in accordance with its mandate, in the peaceful settlement of the conflict and the implementation of a peace plan. "The Commission on Human Rights further calls for unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to all groups of the civilian population in need of such assistance and free access to all areas of the region by international humanitarian organizations contributing to international humanitarian efforts in the Republic of Chechnya. "The Commission on Human Rights calls for the immediate release of all those who have been detained in connection with the conflict and urges that in the interim they receive treatment in conformity with international humanitarian law. The Commission further calls for the International Committee of the Red Cross to be permitted to have regular access to all detainees, in conformity with its standard criteria, in order to verify the conditions of their detention and treatment. To help provide aid to the victims, the Commission asks the authorities of the Russian Federation to facilitate the activities of humanitarian and human rights organizations. "The Commission on Human Rights acknowledges the cooperation of the Russian Federation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special mechanisms of the Commission and encourages the Government of the Russian Federation to continue its cooperation with them. The Commission requests the High Commissioner to continue his consultations with the Government of the Russian Federation, on the basis of his assessment of the situation in the Republic of Chechnya, in order to secure the implementation of the objectives of the international community as reflected in the present consensus statement and to foster confidence-building measures based on respect for human rights.

Annex III ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAMME BUDGET IMPLICATIONS OF RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION AT ITS FIFTY-SECOND SESSION At its fifty-second session, the Commission on Human Rights adopted 85 resolutions and 14 decisions relating mainly to existing mandates that do not involve substantive costs or for which provisions have been made in the programme budget for the 1996-1997 biennium. The Commission approved a few new mandates involving minimal financial implications for the 1996-1997 programme budget. Before taking a decision on the resolutions and decisions, in accordance with regulation 13.1 of the United Nations Financial Regulations and Rules and rule 28 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the Commission was informed through oral statements of the estimated costs relating to implementation of the requests contained in the resolutions and decisions. The Commission also approved the termination of two mandates. It is anticipated that the requirements relating to the resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission at its fifty-second session will be absorbed from within the provisions made under section 21 of the 1996-1997 programme budget for ECOSOC-mandated activities. Thus no additional resources will be required under that section of the programme budget as a result of the adoption of the resolutions and decisions. Accordingly, no statements on administrative and programme budget implications are included in the present report in respect of resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission in 1996.
