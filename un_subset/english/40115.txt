Notes that Tokelau remains firmly committed to the development of its capacity for self-government; 2. Welcomes the substantial progress made towards the devolution of power to the three taupulega (village councils), in particular the delegation of the Administrator's powers to the three taupulega with effect from 1 July 2004 and the assumption by each taupulega from that date of full responsibility for the management of all its public services; 3. Recalls the decision of the General Fono in November 2003, following extensive consultations in all three villages and a meeting of the Special Committee on the Constitution of Tokelau, to explore formally with New Zealand the option of self-government in free association, and the discussions subsequently held between Tokelau and New Zealand pursuant to the General Fono decision; 4. Recalls also the decision of the General Fono in August 2005 to hold a referendum on self-government on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a treaty of free association with New Zealand, and notes the enactment by the General Fono of rules for the referendum; 5.

Further acknowledges Tokelau's need for continued support from the international community; 8. Welcomes the establishment and operation of the Tokelau International Trust Fund to support the future development needs of Tokelau, and calls upon Member States and international and regional agencies to contribute to the Fund and thereby lend practical support to assist this emerging country in overcoming the problems of smallness, isolation and lack of resources; 9. Also welcomes the assurance of the Government of New Zealand that it will meet its obligations to the United Nations with respect to Tokelau and abide by the freely expressed wishes of the people of Tokelau with regard to their future status; 10. Further welcomes the cooperative attitude of the other States and territories in the region towards Tokelau, and their support for its economic and political aspirations and its increasing participation in regional and international affairs; 11. Calls upon the administering Power and United Nations agencies to continue to provide assistance to Tokelau as it further develops; 12. Welcomes the actions taken by the administering Power to transmit information regarding the political, economic and social situation of Tokelau to the Secretary-General; 13. Notes the considerable progress made towards the adoption of a Constitution and of national symbols by Tokelau, and the steps taken by Tokelau and New Zealand to agree to a draft treaty of free association as a basis for an act of self-determination; 14. Also notes that a referendum to determine the future status of Tokelau held in February 2006 failed to produce the two-thirds majority of the valid votes cast required by the General Fono to change Tokelau's status as a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the administration of New Zealand; 15. Further notes the decision of the General Fono to conduct a further referendum to determine the future status of Tokelau from 20 to 24 October 2007; 16. Commends the professional and transparent conduct of both the February 2006 and the October 2007 referendums, monitored by the United Nations; 17. Notes that the October 2007 referendum also failed to produce the two-thirds majority of the valid votes cast required by the General Fono to change Tokelau's status as a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the administration of New Zealand; 18. Welcomes the commitment of both Tokelau and New Zealand to continue to work together in the interests of Tokelau and its people, taking into account the principle of the right to self-determination; 19.
