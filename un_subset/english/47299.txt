Letter dated 8 April 2008 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1284 (1999), in paragraph 14 of which the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint a high-level coordinator for compliance by Iraq with its obligations regarding the repatriation or return of all Kuwaiti and third-country nationals or their remains, as well as the return of all Kuwaiti property, including archives seized by Iraq. After conducting consultations with parties concerned, I have appointed Ambassador Gennady P. Tarasov of the Russian Federation to this position at the level of Under-Secretary-General. He will succeed the late Ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov. I have taken note of the Security Council's request, contained in its letter dated 26 March 2008 (S/2008/206) for a comprehensive report, 12 months after the appointment of the new High-level Coordinator, to include an update on progress during that period, as well as an assessment of the progress that might be achieved, including the conditions that might be necessary and a timescale for the completion of the mandate. I should be grateful if you would bring the present letter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Ban Ki-moon
