UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL A/52/761 S/1998/12 8 January 1998 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH GENERAL ASSEMBLY SECURITY COUNCIL Fifty-second session Fifty-third year Agenda item 61 QUESTION OF CYPRUS Letter dated 5 January 1998 from the Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Upon instructions from my Government and further to our letter dated 12 November 1997 (A/52/684-S/1997/897), I have the honour to draw your attention once more to yet another violation of the national airspace of the Republic of Cyprus and the flight information region of Nicosia committed by the Government of Turkey. This new illegal and unacceptable Turkish action was committed on 29 December 1997 when a Turkish military aircraft, type C-160, violated the Nicosia flight information region and the national airspace of the Republic on two occasions (at 1020 and 1635 hours). On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, I wish to strongly protest once again the new violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus, which are in complete disregard of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant resolutions and decisions of the Organization on the question of Cyprus. I would request, therefore, that all necessary measures be taken to impress upon Turkey to cease and desist from such provocative actions which aggravate the situation in Cyprus. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 61, and of the Security Council. (Signed) S. ZACHKEOS Ambassador Permanent Representative
