Letter dated 14 November 2003 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council As you are aware, my Special Adviser, Mohamed Sahnoun, has been following developments in the Horn of Africa region, especially in Somalia and the Sudan, and providing advice on what useful role the United Nations could play to promote negotiated settlements of conflicts. He has also been representing me at meetings dealing with regional issues. During the past year, Mr. Sahnoun continued to lead the United Nations observer delegation at the Sudan peace talks in Kenya and attended the Somalia National Reconciliation Conference in Mbagathi, Kenya. He also represented me at the Tenth Summit of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, held in Kampala in October 2003. In order for Mr. Sahnoun to continue his efforts, I have decided to extend his appointment until 31 December 2004. I should be grateful if you would bring the present letter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Kofi A. Annan
