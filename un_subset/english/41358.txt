UNITED NATIONS A General Assembly Distr. Original: HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL Fifth special session Letter dated 27 September 2007 from the Permanent Representative of Slovenia to the United Nations Office at Geneva, addressed to the President of the Human Rights Council I would like to express my deepest concern at the most recent events unfolding in Myanmar. The human rights situation deteriorates day by day, especially after security forces started using force in breaking up the peaceful demonstrations led by Buddhist monks that were massively supported by the Burmese people. These events have already resulted in the detention of hundreds of peaceful demonstrators. Several casualties, including killings, were reported, as the situation remains tense and in great need of our attention in order to avoid further deterioration. I therefore request, on behalf of the signatories listed in the enclosed document that you convene, as provided by General Assembly resolution 60/251, a special session of the Human Rights Council, entitled "The human rights situation in Myanmar", which could, if possible, include an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, to be held on Tuesday, 2 October 2007, immediately after the September part of the sixth session of the Human Rights Council, which is now near its end. (Signed): Andraj LOGAR Permanent Representative of Slovenia GE.07-14572
