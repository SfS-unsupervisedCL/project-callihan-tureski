Letter dated 25 April 2007 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council The mandate of my Special Representative for Somalia, Fran√ßois Lonseny Fall, will expire on 8 May 2007. The international community is concerned by the recent developments in the situation on the ground in Somalia. While it has welcomed the announcement by President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed to the Transitional Federal Parliament that a national reconciliation congress would be held in Mogadishu on 16 April 2007, the delay in its convening has added to the complexity of the situation. Since his appointment, Mr. Fall has worked assiduously to support the national reconciliation process and assist the Transitional Federal Government in strengthening the structures of governance, in line with the Transitional Federal Charter. Mr. Fall and the United Nations Political Office for Somalia (UNPOS), in close cooperation with the United Nations country team, are playing a central role in the coordination of international political support and financial, humanitarian and development assistance to both the people of Somalia and the institutions of the Transitional Federal Government. In view of the developments in Somalia and the need for the United Nations to continue to play a primary role in the settlement of the conflict, as provided for in Security Council resolution 1744 (2007), it is my intention to extend the mandate of my Special Representative for Somalia until 8 May 2008. I should be grateful if you could bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Ban Ki-moon
