I should be grateful if you would have the text of this letter and its annex distributed as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 47. (Signed) Nuno Brito Chargé d'affaires a.i. Permanent Mission of Portugal to the United Nations [Original: English and French] Statement on the agreement between Nicaragua and Honduras by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union The European Union warmly welcomes the agreement between Honduras and Nicaragua, signed on 7 February in San Salvador in the presence of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, which provides for a set of measures aimed at building confidence and easing tension in the Caribbean. The European Union also welcomes the decision by the two parties to submit to the International Court of Justice the dispute that arose following the ratification of the Ramirez-Lopez treaty on the demarcation of maritime borders between Colombia and Honduras. These decisions will play a part in sustaining stability in the region and will make it possible to consolidate the important results that have been achieved regarding political and economic integration in Central America. The European Union once again calls upon Honduras and Nicaragua to focus on the task of reconstruction and development in the region, in accordance with the statement adopted by the Stockholm Consultative Group at its meeting in May 1999. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, the associated countries Cyprus, Malta and Turkey and the European Free-Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area align themselves with the present statement.
