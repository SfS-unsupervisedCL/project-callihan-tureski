Letter dated 11 April 2006 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1603 (2005), by which the Council requested me to designate a High Representative for the elections in Côte d'Ivoire. Following the usual consultations, it is my intention to appoint Gérard Stoudmann (Switzerland) to the post of High Representative for the elections in Côte d'Ivoire. Mr. Stoudmann will replace Antonio Monteiro who relinquished his post in mid-March. I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the important contribution made by Mr. Monteiro to the peace process in Côte d'Ivoire. I should be grateful if you would bring this matter to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) Kofi A. Annan
