Fifty-seventh session Agenda item 112 Programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 United Nations Fund for International Partnerships Seventh report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 1. The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships (A/57/133). During its consideration of the report, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information. 2. The Advisory Committee recalls that, following Robert Edward Turner's announcement on 18 September 1997 of a gift valued at $1 billion in support of United Nations causes, a United Nations Fund for International Partnerships (UNFIP) was created, on 1 March 1998, to interface with the United Nations Foundation (UNF). An agreement was signed on 12 June 1998 between the United Nations and the United Nations Foundation, the text of which is contained in the report of the Secretary-General on UNFIP dated 24 November 1998 (A/53/700, annex). 3. The report of the Secretary-General (A/57/133) was submitted in accordance with General Assembly decision 52/466 of 31 March 1998, in which the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to continue to inform it on a regular basis about the activities of UNFIP. 4. As indicated in the report, since the launching in 1998 of the partnership between UNFIP and the United Nations Foundation, a total of $423 million had been programmed as at the end of 2001, involving 222 projects in 120 countries and 33 United Nations implementing partners (see para. 35). As shown in the annex to the report of the Secretary-General, of this total amount programmed, $305.1 million represents contributions from UNF and $117.9 million represents contributions from other donors. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee received updated information indicating that the total amount programmed as at 31 August 2002 amounted to $484.6 million, of which $20.5 related to administrative support costs. The updated information provided to the Committee, including the status of cash transfers (by tranche) and the status of project implementation, is provided in the annex below. 5. The Advisory Committee notes from the report that a total of $111.9 million was programmed for 2001 as a result of the approvals related to the ninth and tenth funding rounds ($105.7 million) and intersessional requests ($6.2 million). Grants were approved for 55 projects for 2001, in the areas of population and women ($18.4 million), children's health ($32.2 million), peace, security and human rights ($19.2 million), environment ($36.8 million) and institution-building capacity ($5.2 million) (see paras. 46-48 and annex). Section II of the report provides information on the programme areas. 6. In the area of monitoring and evaluation, the Advisory Committee notes that the strategy includes four different components so as to ensure the cost-effective and efficient achievement of the goals in each of the major programmes (ibid., paras. 3337). However, the Committee noted, during its exchange with the representatives of the Secretary-General, the large number of reports involved. A total of 137 annual progress reports were analysed in 2001 (ibid., para. 36), among other monitoring activities, yet this excludes quarterly reports for the 222 projects undertaken. The Committee is of the opinion that the present process appears to be onerous and bureaucratic and that the time has come to assess the whole process and to streamline it. The Committee is of the opinion that it is necessary to analyse whether the reporting exercise has enabled UNFIP to become more focused, enabling it to better measure impact and to attain the objective indicated in the Secretary-General's report (see ibid., para. 37). As indicated therein, compelling evidence of the impact of projects supported by UNFIP and UNF will be critical to generating additional resources and creating public-private partnerships in support of United Nations causes (ibid.). 7. In this regard, the Advisory Committee notes and welcomes the focus in 2002 on evaluating clusters of projects designed to address a significant issue within a programme area (ibid.). Moreover, the Committee welcomes the utilization of a systems application in order to enhance the capacity of UNFIP to track project implementation and fund flows, thus streamlining the financial reporting modalities of its implementing partners (ibid., para. 51). More needs to be done, however, and the Committee looks forward to seeing evidence of progress in this regard in the next report on UNFIP. 8. The Advisory Committee enquired about the recent volatility of the stock market and its possible effect on the donation. The Committee was informed that the donor's original pledge remained firm and that, in addition, the United Nations Foundation, in consultation with the United Nations, was considering how to strengthen its support to the United Nations through its advocacy and resource mobilization capacity. The Committee requests that additional information be provided in this regard in the context of the next report to be submitted to the General Assembly. The Committee expresses its appreciation for the continued commitment of the donor. 9. The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly take note of the report of the Secretary-General.
