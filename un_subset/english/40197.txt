General Assembly Security Council Sixty-second session Agenda item 8 General debate Sixty-second year Letter dated 4 October 2007 from the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General We would like to express our appreciation to you for your principled stance on the incident that took place last week during the general debate of the General Assembly regarding the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We appreciate the statement made by your Deputy Spokesman that within the United Nations the Secretary-General and the Secretariat observe the practice of using the name former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as referred to in Security Council resolutions. We remain deeply concerned by the incident and the actions of the current President of the General Assembly, Srgjan Kerim, who in full contravention of Security Council resolutions 817 (1993) and 845 (1993), and General Assembly resolution 47/225 of 8 April 1993, which recommended that his country of nationality be "provisionally referred to for all purposes within the United Nations as the `former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia' pending settlement of the difference that has arisen over the name of the State", chose, when designating his country, to use the very name over which there is a difference. Likewise, his formal response to the point of order raised by Greece following the above designation, in his capacity as President of the General Assembly, that: "I am fully aware of the facts pointed out in the statement by the representative of Greece. At the same time, as President of the General Assembly, Î™ am due to show respect to the dignity of every single Member State, including my own", is a clear indication of his lack of respect for the impartiality required of his office, as well as for the resolutions and the procedures of the Organization, which have been consistently observed by all previous Presidents of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General and the Member States. Most important, such actions support the intransigent position of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the ongoing negotiations carried out under the auspices of the United Nations pursuant to Security Council resolution 845 (1993) with a view to reaching agreement over the name. That was clearly manifested by the statement made by President Crvenkovski on the same day before the General Assembly, according to which "the name of my [his] country is the Republic of Macedonia and will be the Republic of Macedonia". We expect that henceforth the President of the General Assembly will uphold and observe the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, respect the relevant resolutions of the Organization and act in conformity with the principle of impartiality inherent in the institution of the presidency of the General Assembly. I should be grateful if you would arrange for the present letter to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 8, and of the Security Council.
