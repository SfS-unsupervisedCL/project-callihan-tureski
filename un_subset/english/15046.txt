Commission on Sustainable Development Ninth session 16-27 April 2001 Letter dated 12 February 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Permit me to inform you about the Conference on Environmentally Sustainable Transport (EST), which was held in Vienna in October 2000. The Conference was organized by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management of Austria. The results of this Conference are summarized in the enclosed paper entitled "EST! Environmentally sustainable transport: futures, strategies and best practices" (see enclosure I). I also enclose a paper entitled "FIST recommendations" (see enclosure II), which is based on the results of the Workshop on Financing Sustainable Transport Infrastructure and Technology. The Workshop was organized by the Central European Initiative, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, the Government of Austria and the Austrian Energy Agency. I would be very grateful if the present letter and its enclosures could be circulated as a document of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
