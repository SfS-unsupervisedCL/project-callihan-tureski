Sixty-seventh session Agenda item 45 Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) Letter dated 9 August 2013 from the Permanent Representative of Argentina to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to write to you in reference to the letter dated 28 May 2013 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations (A/67/880), circulated in reply to the letter dated 9 April 2013 from Argentina (A/67/832). The Argentine Republic rejects each and every one of the claims contained in the aforementioned British reply. It is not our intention at this time to reiterate the numerous and irrefutable historical arguments we have set out in the annex to the letter dated 19 September 2012 (A/67/389), in the letter dated 3 January 2013 (A/67/688), in the letter dated 9 April 2013 referenced above (A/67/832) and in various other relevant communications. The persistence of this historical dispute for 180 years and the refusal of the United Kingdom to resolve it through the resumption of negotiations with Argentina, as mandated by the United Nations in many resolutions of the General Assembly and of the Special Committee on decolonization and by other regional and international bodies, is evidence of the United Kingdom's failure to comply with its obligations not only to Argentina, but also to the entire international community. Argentina reiterates, in line with what has been stated by the Special Committee on decolonization in successive resolutions on the question of the Malvinas Islands, that the matter is a special and particular colonial situation involving a sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom. As established in General Assembly resolution 2065 (XX), which the United Kingdom has recognized as applicable to this question, the situation must be resolved peacefully through negotiations. Argentina proposes to the United Kingdom that, instead of seeking to refute historical events which it has acknowledged and whose consequences it also understands, it should honour its obligation and immediately resume negotiations with Argentina on sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas in order to find a just and definitive solution to this dispute. In so doing, it would be acting in a lawful and responsible manner, in accordance with its obligations as a Member of the United Nations. Reaffirming the Argentine Republic's legitimate sovereignty rights over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas, I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the General Assembly under agenda item 45, concerning the question of the Malvinas Islands.
