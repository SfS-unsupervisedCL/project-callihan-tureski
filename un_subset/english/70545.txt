Sixty-eighth session Agenda item 148 Financing of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei Budget performance of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 and proposed budget for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions Appropriation for 2012/13 Expenditure for 2012/13 Unencumbered balance for 2012/13 Appropriation for 2013/14 Projected expenditure for 2013/14a Estimated unencumbered balance for 2013/14a Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General for 2014/15 Recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 2014/15 a Estimates as at 31 January 2014. 1. The recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in paragraphs 30 and 37 below would entail a reduction of $1,037,600 to the proposed budget of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. The Committee has made recommendations and observations on specific issues, where appropriate, in the paragraphs below. 2. During its consideration of the financing of UNISFA, the Advisory Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General, who provided additional information and clarification, concluding with written responses received on 14 April 2014. The documents reviewed and those used for background by the Committee are listed at the end of the present report. The Committee's detailed comments and recommendations on the findings of the Board of Auditors on the United Nations peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 and on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping operations can be found in its related reports (see A/68/843 and A/68/782 respectively). II. Financial performance report for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 3. In its resolution 66/241 B, the General Assembly appropriated an amount of $257,932,000 gross ($256,573,400 net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. Expenditures for the period totalled $257,846,200 gross ($256,308,900 net). The resulting unencumbered balance of $85,800, in gross terms, represents zero per cent of the appropriation. 4. An analysis of variances is provided in section IV of the performance report for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 (A/68/604). Lower requirements were attributable mainly to: (a) Military contingents ($10,539,700): lower-than-anticipated levels of reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment, offset in part by higher-than-anticipated requirements for freight for contingent-owned equipment, and for standard troop costs (see para. 34); (b) Air transportation ($6,733,000): overall lower utilization of helicopters due mainly to the inability of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism to undertake aerial monitoring missions along the Safe Demilitarized Border Zone as a result of the security situation prevailing in and around Kadugli, offset in part by higher-than-budgeted requirements for petrol, oil and lubricants, owing both to a higher-than-budgeted number of litres used and to a higher-than-budgeted cost per litre (see paras. 43-44). 5. Higher requirements were primarily attributable to: (a) Facilities and infrastructure ($4,488,200): higher-than-budgeted requirements for petrol, oil and lubricants and the unplanned acquisition of equipment and infrastructures (see para. 41); (b) Other supplies, services and equipment ($4,427,500): higher-than-budgeted expenditure for the transportation of prefabricated units, related construction equipment and 250 tents (see para. 48). 6. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the expenditure of almost 100 per cent of the 2012/13 budget was achieved through a strategic management of the allotment and redeployments within the funding envelope. In this regard, the Committee notes that, according to information provided to it, there were significant variances in certain object codes of expenditure, including: (a) Under international staff, common staff costs, the expenditure was $7,888,800 while the apportionment was $5,805,800, which represents a variance of 35.9 per cent; (b) Under consultants, non-training, the expenditure was $219,300 while the apportionment was $16,500, which represents a variance of 1,229.2 per cent; (c) Under facilities and infrastructure, acquisition of water purification equipment, the expenditure was $465,300 while the apportionment was $13,800, which represents a variance of 3,271.6 per cent; (d) Under other supplies, services and equipment, other freight and related costs, the expenditure was $6,155,200 while the apportionment was $1,020,000, which represents a variance of 503.4 per cent. 7. The comments of the Advisory Committee on the information presented in the performance report on individual objects of expenditure can be found, where relevant, in the discussion of the proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 (A/68/728) in the paragraphs below. III. Information on performance for the current period 8. With respect to assessments for UNISFA, the Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 24 February 2014, a total of $694,416,000 had been assessed on Member States in respect of UNISFA since its inception. Payments received as at the same date amounted to $580,928,000, leaving an outstanding balance of $113,488,000. The Committee notes that the cash position of the mission was $116,600,000 as at 24 February 2014, which covers the three-month operating cash reserve of $49,514,000, leaving $67,086,000 in remaining cash. 9. The Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 31 December 2013, the outstanding balance for contingent-owned equipment amounted to $13,739,000. The amount of $573,000 had been paid for 15 claims for death and disability compensation related to the period from inception to 31 January 2014. The Committee was also informed that three death and disability claims were pending. The Committee expects all outstanding claims to be settled expeditiously. 10. Regarding incumbency, the Advisory Committee was informed that, as at 31 January 2014, the incumbency for UNISFA for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 was as follows: Authorizeda Encumbered Vacancy rate (percentage) Military and police personnel Military observers Military contingents United Nations police Civilian personnel International staff National staff General temporary assistance United Nations Volunteers a Represents the highest authorized strength for the period. 11. The Advisory Committee was provided with a table showing current and projected expenditures for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014, with reasons for variances, and notes that at the end of the current financial period the estimated total expenditures would amount to $305,834,000 against the appropriation of $329,108,600, leaving a projected unencumbered balance of $23,274,600. Construction 12. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was provided with a table showing the current status of the construction plan for the period 2013/14 (annex I), in which it is indicated that expenditure to date amounts to $5,550,417 while the apportionment amounts to $23,471,050. The Committee recalls that in its report on the proposed budget for the period 2013/14 it had taken into account the low rate of implementation of construction projects in the periods 2011/12 and 2012/13, and recommended against increasing the resources requested under construction services ($23,083,800), thereby maintaining the same level of resources as for the period 2012/13 ($10,953,800). The Committee also stated that should additional resources be required in 2013/14 for construction services, this should be reflected in the performance report (see A/67/780/Add.18, para. 39). This was subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/270, wherein the Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to make every effort to ensure that all construction projects are completed in a timely manner and that Headquarters continues to provide effective oversight. 13. The Committee was informed upon enquiry that the construction programme in the Secretary-General's proposed budget for the period 2013/14 called for a staff living accommodation project (hardwall accommodation) valued at $8 million to be completed; the project included the construction of a two-storey building valued at $5 million to serve as a force headquarters. The Committee was informed by the Secretary-General that the reduction of the construction budget from the proposed $23,083,800 to $10,953,800 made it unviable to proceed with the initial plan. Given the reprioritization of operational requirements, the mission had to produce a revised construction programme that relied on prefabricated accommodation. Upon further requests for clarification on the changes to the construction plans, the Committee was informed that the revision, made in consultation with all stakeholders, took into account two factors: (a) the interim nature of the mission, which makes the financial viability of concrete construction more difficult to justify; and (b) the fact that the design, acquisition and construction of two-storey concrete buildings would require a longer time frame than that of prefabricated units. With respect to the Committee's recommendation to reflect additional resource requirements in the performance report, the Secretariat told the Committee that it understood the recommendation to mean that the mission had the flexibility to reprioritize approved funds to meet its requirements for construction. 14. The Advisory Committee recalls that its recommendations on resource proposals relating to construction services for the period 2013/14 were based on the historical trend of low implementation of construction projects by UNISFA, while providing the possibility for increased construction expenditure by recommending that should additional resources be required during the period, these would be reflected in the performance report. IV. Proposed budget for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 A. Mandate and planned results 15. The mandate of UNISFA was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1990 (2011), which was most recently extended until 31 May 2014 by resolution 2126 (2013) (see A/68/728, para. 1). 16. In his report on the budget for the Force for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2014, the Secretary-General states that the Security Council, in its resolution 2024 (2011), expanded the mandate of UNISFA in support of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism and extended its area of operations to include the Safe Demilitarized Border Zone. In its resolution 2104 (2013), the Council increased the authorized strength of UNISFA to 5,326 troops and decided that support for the operational activities of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism would include support to the ad hoc committee tasked with investigating and addressing violations and complaints related to the implementation of border and security agreements (see A/68/728, paras. 6-7). 17. The Secretary-General indicates that the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism is operational and that integrated teams consisting of United Nations monitors and representatives of the Sudan and South Sudan are conducting monitoring and verification patrols within the Safe Demilitarized Border Zone (see A/68/728, para. 12). 18. According to the report, five assumptions will guide UNISFA activities during the 2014/15 budget period: (a) that the return and resettlement of displaced persons will continue; (b) that the instability in South Sudan may draw attention away from the implementation of the various cooperation agreements between the Sudan and South Sudan, in particular the 20 June 2011 Agreement; (c) that the overall security situation will remain stable but unpredictable with risks of non-military security threats; (d) that the seasonal migration of nomads will take place peacefully and without major obstruction; and (e) that it is unlikely that the Sudan and South Sudan will finalize the issue of the disputed and claimed areas (see A/68/728, paras. 13-18). 19. In the report, the following strategic priorities for the period 2014/15 are set out: (a) preserving and enhancing peace and stability in the Abyei Area, including through protection of civilians; (b) enabling the peaceful and organized migration and resettlement of internally displaced persons; (c) assisting the parties in establishing and operationalizing the key institutions of the 20 June 2011 Agreement and other relevant mechanisms agreed upon by both parties; (d) supporting the effective implementation of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism; and (e) reinforcing the mission's partnership with various key stakeholders (see A/68/728, para. 19). 20. In the report it is stated that UNISFA will conduct its operations through the mission headquarters in Abyei town and nine permanent operational locations in Abyei, in addition to one headquarters and four sector headquarters of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism. It is also stated that the mission will continue to provide support to the deployment of staff officers, military observers and national monitors to the sector headquarters locations of the Joint Mechanism (see A/68/728, para. 24). 21. The Secretary-General indicates that UNISFA will complete two large construction projects, each valued at $4.6 million: the paving of the Anthony airstrip and the relocation of the helipads so that they are outside the Abyei headquarters perimeter. The second project, which was proposed primarily to respond to health and safety concerns, has become of a higher priority following the relocation of two additional helicopters to Abyei from Malakal. The relocation of the helipads would allow the mission to continue the expansion of the Abyei camp. The mission will also focus on maintaining supply and resupply lines of fuel, rations and other logistical support to all locations (see A/68/728, paras. 25 and 27). B. Regional mission cooperation and partnerships 22. In his report, the Secretary-General states that UNISFA will maintain regular and close interaction with the Special Envoy for the Sudan and South Sudan. The mission will also retain and leverage the existing logistical arrangements and support structures it shares with the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe, Uganda, and neighbouring missions, such as the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). In addition to the functions previously identified for transfer in 2012/13 and 2013/14 to the Regional Service Centre, other communications and information technology functions and related resources have been identified for transfer to the Centre, to establish a regional communications and information technology service (see A/68/728, paras. 39-42). The Committee comments further on the global field support strategy in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping operations (A/68/782). 23. With respect to partnerships, the Secretary-General indicates that strong civilian-military coordination will continue to be required to support the delivery of humanitarian aid and ensure the safety and freedom of movement of humanitarian personnel and that UNISFA will continue to coordinate its activities with United Nations agencies, funds and programmes present in Abyei, as well as national and international non-governmental organizations and bilateral donors. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights will continue to conduct human rights monitoring (see A/68/728, paras. 43-44). C. Resource requirements 24. The proposed budget for UNISFA for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 amounts to $328,210,600, representing a decrease of $898,000 (0.3 per cent) in gross terms compared with the appropriation of $329,108,600 for the period 2013/14. The Advisory Committee notes that, if compared with the projected expenditures of $305,834,000 for 2013/14 (see para. 11 above), it would reflect a proposed increase for 2014/15 in the amount of $22,376,600. The proposed budget provides for the deployment of 225 military observers, 5,101 military contingent personnel, 50 United Nations police officers, 150 international staff, 107 national staff, 37 United Nations Volunteers and 15 temporary positions. 25. An analysis of variances is provided in section III of the proposed budget. Higher resource requirements for 2014/15 are attributable mainly to: (a) Under other supplies, services and equipment ($6,882,100), an increase in projected expenditure on mine detection and mine clearance; (b) Under military contingents ($6,367,200), the increased deployment of military contingent personnel as reflected in increased standard troop costs and reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment, offset partially by an increase in the delayed deployment factor; (c) Under international staff ($3,946,800), a reduction in the vacancy rate from 30 per cent in 2013/14 to 20 per cent in 2014/15 and a constant level of incumbency over the year and updated common staff costs for 2014/15. 26. Lower resource requirements for 2014/15 are attributable mainly to: (a) Under facilities and infrastructure ($17,931,500), the fact that the 2013/14 budget provided for additional construction projects related to the operationalization of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism, leading in 2014/15 to lower requirements for the acquisition of facilities and infrastructure and other facilities equipment such as generators and field defence equipment; (b) Under air transportation ($4,534,400), the reconfiguration of air assets and a reduction in flight hours. 1. Military and police personnel Category Approved 2013/14a Proposed 2014/15 Variance Military contingent personnel Total a Represents the highest level of authorized/proposed strength. 27. The estimated requirements for military and police personnel for 2014/15 amount to $146,128,300, an increase of $5,167,600 (3.7 per cent) compared with the appropriation for 2013/14. The proposed increase for 2014/15 is attributable mainly to increased requirements under military contingents as described in paragraph 25 (b) above. 28. The Advisory Committee recommends that the requested resources for military and police personnel be approved. 2. Civilian personnel National staffb b Includes National Professional Officers and national General Service staff. 29. The estimated requirements for civilian personnel for 2014/15 amount to $30,054,900, an increase of $5,108,400 (20.5 per cent) compared with the appropriation for 2013/14. The cost estimates for civilian staff reflect vacancy factors of 20 per cent for international staff, 60 per cent for National Professional Officers, 30 per cent for national General Service staff, 40 per cent for United Nations Volunteers and 20 per cent for general temporary assistance positions (see A/68/728, para. 61). The increased requirements under civilian personnel for 2014/15 are attributable mainly to increased requirements under international staff as described in paragraph 25 (c) above. 30. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was provided with a table showing the vacancy and actual deployment rates of military, police and civilian personnel (see annex II). According to the table, the vacancy rate for United Nations Volunteers as at 31 March 2014 was 44.4 per cent, while the rate was 62.5 per cent for temporary positions. Given the actual vacancy rates, the Committee recommends the application of the following vacancy rates in the 2014/15 budget: 45 per cent for United Nations Volunteers and 50 per cent for temporary positions. 31. The Advisory Committee was also provided upon enquiry with a list of posts that will have been vacant for two years or longer as at 30 June 2014. Of those posts, which totalled 34, 11 are under recruitment; the status of recruitment of the remaining 23 posts has not been explained. The Committee recommends that information on the status of these 23 posts be provided to the General Assembly at the time of its consideration of the present report. The Committee comments further on the subject of long-term vacancies in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping operations (see A/68/782). 32. Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was informed that the mission presently has 11 international and 58 national staff members who speak Arabic. The Committee encourages the mission to continue its efforts to recruit more Arabic-speaking staff. Posts 33. The staffing changes proposed in component 2, support, include: (a) The reclassification of 1 P-3 Board of Inquiry Officer post to a P-4 Chief Risk Management and Compliance Officer post, to support the increased workload in the area of risk management arising from the proposed replacement of the existing Compliance and Monitoring Unit with the Risk Management and Compliance Unit; (b) The conversion of 1 Claims Assistant post from the Field Service level to the national General Service level, to continue to handle the administrative workload relating to claims and compliance in the proposed Risk Management and Compliance Unit; (c) The abolishment of 1 P-3 Finance Officer position in the Finance Section owing to the temporary nature of the workload associated with the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards and Umoja; (d) The conversion of 1 Staff Counsellor post at the National Professional Officer level to a P-3 post; (e) The conversion of 1 Air Operations Officer post at the National Professional Officer level to a P-3 post, to act as the Chief of the Mission Air Operations Centre. 34. Subject to its recommendation in paragraph 30 above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the requested resources for civilian personnel be approved. 3. Operational costs Apportioned 2013/14 35. The estimated operational requirements for 2014/15 amount to $152,027,400, a decrease of $11,174,000 (6.8 per cent) compared with the appropriation for 2013/14. The decrease is attributable mainly to decreased requirements under facilities and infrastructure and air transportation. Official travel 36. The proposed budget includes a request of $1,382,300 for official travel, representing an increase of $99,400 (7.7 per cent) over the apportionment for 2013/14 of $1,282,900. Upon enquiry, the Committee was provided with a table showing a breakdown of travel undertaken outside the mission area in 2012/13 (annex III). The information indicates that a number of repeat trips to New York were undertaken and that on some occasions more than one traveller went to the same meeting. 37. In his report, the Secretary-General indicates that the increased requirements provide for travel to external training courses in new electronic systems related to fuel management, transport and web security and include an allocation of indirect costs to support Umoja and other information technology systems in the field (see A/68/728, para. 80). The Advisory Committee is of the view that, taking into account the increased opportunities for using alternative means of communication and given the reductions expected pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 65/268 and 67/254, the explanation provided by the Secretary-General for the variance does not justify the increase of 7.7 per cent in the proposed requirements for official travel for 2014/15. The Committee therefore recommends against the increase requested for official travel and that resources for official travel be maintained at the level of $1,282,900. The Committee encourages the mission to increase its efforts to consolidate the holding of different meetings at the same location and to minimize the number of travellers on any given trip. The Committee makes further comments on official travel in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping operations (see A/68/782). Quick-impact projects 38. The Secretary-General proposes 15 quick-impact projects for 2014/15, with estimated resource requirements in the amount of $500,000. The proposed projects would contribute to strengthening the capacity of the rule of law infrastructure in the Abyei Area, including through the renovation of police stations and detention centres and cells, and to supporting small-scale projects related to water, health and educational institutions. The Secretary-General indicates that the projects act as confidence- and trust-building measures between the mission and the communities and between communities, as well as acting as conflict-mitigation tools (see A/68/728, paras. 70-71). Upon enquiry, the Advisory Committee was provided with a list of the proposed projects for 2014/15 (annex IV) and notes that the projects relate primarily to water tanks, generators, grinding mills, hand pumps and school furniture and equipment. Upon enquiry as to the status of implementation of previous quick-impact projects, the Committee was informed that UNISFA has completed and fully expended 8 of the 10 projects approved in 2012/13; the two remaining projects have been completed but final payments are pending. With respect to the period 2013/14, the Committee was informed that the projects have been delayed by the security situation and by a reassessment resulting in the use of water supply projects as a means to mitigate conflict. Six projects totalling the allocated budget of $250,000 have been approved by the mission's project review committee for implementation in the 2013/14 period, with four of the six having commenced in March 2014. The Committee has no objection to the requested resources for quick-impact projects. Efficiency gains 39. With respect to efficiency measures, it is stated in the report that the mission will use 10 50-seater buses to rotate troops rather than the more costly rotary-wing aircraft and that it will establish a turnkey contract for the supply of rations in which the contractor is responsible for delivery through to the battalion level, as well as a new turnkey contract for fuel (see A/68/728, paras. 32-33 and 36). The Advisory Committee commends the mission on the innovative efficiency measure of using buses for troop rotations, which the Committee notes is tailored to meet the specific circumstances of the mission's geographical location. Inter-mission cooperation 40. Upon enquiry as to inter-mission cooperation, the Advisory Committee was informed that UNISFA and UNMISS have been engaging in inter-mission cooperation in operational and support areas since the inception of UNISFA. UNISFA anticipates that during the period 2014/15 it will utilize UNMISS rotary- and fixed-wing air assets and has budgeted accordingly, with related costs such as fuel consumption being based on previous experience and projected consumption levels. The Committee was also provided with the table below, which sets out information on services provided and received by UNISFA during the period 2012/13. The Committee comments further on the subject of inter-mission cooperation in its report on cross-cutting issues related to peacekeeping operations (see A/68/782). Inter-mission cooperation during the period 2012/13 Services Provided to Charges reimbursed to UNISFA (United States dollars) Cargo/passenger flights UNMISS Passenger flights United Nations Support Office for the African Union Mission in Somalia Received from Charges reimbursed by UNISFA (United States dollars) Provision of generator fuel United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) Provision of vehicle fuel MONUSCO Provision of Jet A-1 fuel 41. Subject to its recommendation in paragraph 37 above, the Advisory Committee recommends that the requested resources for operational costs be approved. V. Conclusion 42. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNISFA for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013 is indicated in section V of the performance report (A/68/604). The Advisory Committee recommends that the unencumbered balance of $85,800 for the period from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013, as well as other income/adjustments amounting to $6,906,600 for the period ended 30 June 2013, be credited to Member States. 43. The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of UNISFA for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 is indicated in section IV of the proposed budget (A/68/728). The Advisory Committee recommends that the General Assembly: (a) Appropriate an amount of $327,173,000 for the maintenance of the mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015; (b) Assess the amount in paragraph (a) above at a monthly rate of $27,264,417, should the Security Council decide to continue the mandate of the mission.
