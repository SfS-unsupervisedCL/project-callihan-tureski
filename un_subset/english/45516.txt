UNITED NATIONS A General Assembly Distr. Original: ENGLISH HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL Tenth session Agenda item 4 HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE COUNCIL'S ATTENTION Letter dated 29 October 2008 from the Permanent Mission of the Sudan addressed to the Secretariat of the Human Rights Council The Permanent Mission of the Republic of the Sudan to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva presents its compliments to the Secretariat of the Human Rights Council, and, while expressing its profound sadness and sorrow, would like to inform the Council that the "Justice and Equality Movement" in Darfur has committed a heinous and cowardly terrorist crime by kidnapping and later killing four civilian Chinese nationals working in development projects in Western Kurdufan State and injuring two others. The terrorist organization Justice and Equality Movement and other armed groups active in Darfur have committed, while the entire world was watching, several terrorist acts within and outside the conflict area in Darfur. The following acts are provided as examples: The killing of humanitarian assistance workers and their carjacking The attack on the national capital Khartoum on 10 May 2008, which claimed lives of civilians and destruction of civilian installations and private houses The shooting-down of a copter plane operated by the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and the attempted act of shooting down three UNAMID copter planes in Western Darfur in August 2008 The kidnapping of Egyptian and European tourists from tourism sites in Southern Egypt in September 2008 The Permanent Mission of the Sudan would like to point out that the crimes committed by the Justice and Equality Movement do not only defy the principle of soliciting no violence as a means to attain any objective whatsoever, which is an established principle of international law applicable to all State and non-State actors, but that they also fall clearly within the crimes proscribed by international legal instruments elaborated to eliminate and suppress international terrorism. This salient principle is more evident in the light of the fact that these crimes have taken a regional and international dimension that has transcended Sudanese territories and targeted other nationalities from Africa, Asia and Europe. The Permanent Mission of the Sudan would like to stress the obligation of Member States of the United Nations to take a clear position, collectively and unilaterally, to condemn these heinous crimes and to take decisive measures for their elimination and the punishment of the perpetrators. The Permanent Mission of the Republic of the Sudan requests that the present letter be circulated to all Member States accredited in Geneva as a document of the Human Rights Council.
