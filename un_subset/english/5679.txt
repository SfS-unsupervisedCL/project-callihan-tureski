UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1998/68 26 January 1998 ENGLISH ORIGINAL: ARABIC LETTER DATED 26 JANUARY 1998 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL On instructions from my Government, and in the light of the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to occupy, in defiance of the law, three islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates, namely, Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, applying a policy of fait accompli and taking many arbitrary and illegal measures to annex these islands by force, I should like to request the Security Council to retain item 10 of the summary statement by the Secretary-General on matters of which the Security Council is seized (S/1998/44). That item, entitled "Letter dated 3 December 1971 from the Permanent Representatives of Algeria, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and Iraq to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (S/10409)", deals with the problem of the occupation of the aforementioned islands, which belong to the United Arab Emirates, by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Government of the United Arab Emirates also requests the Security Council to remain seized of the matter until the Islamic Republic of Iran ends its illegal occupation of Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa and allows the United Arab Emirates to regain its sovereignty and resume effective control over those islands. The Government of the United Arab Emirates takes this opportunity to reiterate its commitment to security and stability in the Arab Gulf and its determination to implement the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law. I should be grateful if you would have this letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Mohammad J. SAMHAN Ambassador Permanent Representative
