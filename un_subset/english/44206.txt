Introduction 1. The present report is the sixteenth consolidated report on the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, and is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 61/77. 2. The Office for Disarmament Affairs engaged in a number of activities related to the United Nations Register. It published "Information Booklet 2007" and "Guidelines for Reporting International Transfers: Questions and Answers", which can be accessed at the Register web page at http://disarmament.un.org/cab/ register.html. Additionally, the Office produced and updated the following electronic publications related to the Register: "International transfers of small arms and light weapons: calendar year 2006"; "United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database: Export and Import of Small Arms and Light Weapons"; and "United Nations Register of Conventional Arms: Pattern of Reporting by States: 19922006", which are also accessible at the web page. In order to facilitate deliberations, the Office distributed information sheets containing tables and graphs on the United Nations Register to delegations during the session of the First Committee of the General Assembly in October 2007. On 13 May 2008, the Office also made a presentation and provided background material on the Register to the second session of the Group of Governmental Experts to examine the feasibility of a legally binding instrument on the import, export and transfer of conventional arms. With a view to organizing regional workshops as recommended by the 2006 Group of Governmental Experts on the Register (A/61/261), the Office for Disarmament Affairs continued its efforts at fund-raising for this purpose. In addition, it launched a pilot project entitled "Electronic Filing of National Reports in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms". The Office also made a presentation at a regional policy seminar on implementing arms transfer control commitments, held in Moscow on 12 March 2008. II. Information received from Governments 3. Information received from Governments is presented below as follows: :: Section A -- an index of information received by the Secretary-General; :: Section B -- individual replies of Governments on transfers of conventional arms. Where appropriate, the relevant parts of notes verbale are reproduced. 4. The index of returns is provided for ease of reference. As regards the information contained in the index, it should be noted that a "yes" denotes a submission of data regarding imports and/or exports in relation to the seven categories of arms covered by the Register during the reporting period. For the purpose of uniform tabulation, responses by Governments that contained either "nil", "none", "0", a dash (-) or which otherwise indicated that no exports and/or imports in the categories covered by the Register had taken place, are reflected in the tables as "nil" reports. A blank space under data on imports and/or exports in the index of information indicates that no information was provided. In some cases, however, an explanation can be found in the note verbale of the country in question, as indicated above. Only those parts of the standardized forms that contain specific data and notes verbale of Governments providing relevant information are reproduced in section B. Replies in the standardized reporting forms and the simplified "nil" reporting form or in notes verbale containing "nil" or blank reports are listed in the index of information only.

Slovenia (on behalf of the European Union) [24 April 2008] European Union common reply to General Assembly resolution 61/77, entitled "Transparency in Armaments" 1. In resolution 61/77, operative paragraph 7 (a), the General Assembly requests States Members of the United Nations to provide the Secretary-General with their views on the continuing operation of the Register and its further development, as well as on transparency measures related to weapons of mass destruction. 2. The member States of the European Union continue to consider transparency in armaments an important instrument in confidence-building and security among States. The Register of Conventional Arms is an important, concrete and effective measure in that respect. 3. The Register provides data on international arms transfers of those categories of conventional arms that are potentially destabilizing when accumulated excessively. It serves to enhance transparency, build confidence and promote better understanding among States. The member States of the European Union are committed to securing the widest possible participation in the Register to improve its effectiveness. In that context, Union contacts with non-participating States in support of securing wider participation have shown that it is only in exceptional cases that non-participation is motivated by disagreement with the concept embodied in the Register. 4. The member States of the European Union welcome all efforts to further strengthen the role of the Register in the field of conventional arms control. In that respect, EU reiterates the first expansion of the scope of the Register in 2003 by lowering the reporting threshold of artillery systems, and the inclusion of Man Portable Air Defense Systems as a subcategory under the existing category of missiles and missile launchers. In 2006, the Group of Governmental Experts built on the successful work of the 2003 Group and again an extension of the scope of the Register was established, which entailed three important developments. First, it was agreed that international transfers of conventional arms involving only Member States should be reported to the Register. Second, the notification commitment regarding the category of warships and submarines was extended. Third, an optional standardized form for the notification of transfers of small arms and light weapons was developed. 5. In the earlier transparency in armaments resolutions, the General Assembly also called on Member States to provide additional information on transfers of small arms and light weapons by using definitions and reporting measures they deemed appropriate. However, with the reference contained in Assembly resolution 61/77 to the optional standardized form, notification on such weapons will be more accessible to States willing to do so. Moreover, the 2007 reports already show concrete results in that respect. In 2006, five States provided additional information on small arms and light weapons in their respective reports, whereas in 2007, 39 States made good use of the optional standardized form, including small arms and light weapons information in their reports. The member States of the European Union welcome the increased voluntary reporting on small arms and light weapons transfers and express their hope and expectation that in 2008 and the following years even more States will submit small arms information to the Register. The Union believes that that would enhance transparency in the area of small arms, which should also help in the fight against illicit trafficking in such arms. 6. The member States of the European Union express the hope that the 2009 review of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms will build upon the success of the 2003 and 2006 reviews and further expand the scope of the Register. In particular, the European Union would welcome an expansion of the Register by a separate category on data on procurement through national production and military holdings, and/or a standardized form thereof. 7. Most notably, the inclusion of small arms and light weapons in a separate category of the Register remains the European Union's highest priority. The inclusion of such weapons in a separate category would further stimulate United Nations Member States to report on their small arms and light weapons transfers, which are a crucial element of transparency in armaments in many parts of the world. 8. The member States of the European Union agree that transparency in armaments is important and that measures aimed at enhancing such transparency should be developed. However, the Union would like to point out that measures in the field of conventional arms should be distinguished from those aimed at increased transparency in the field of weapons of mass destruction. If such a distinction is not made, the viability of the Register would be affected and increased participation and transparency jeopardized. 9. The member States of the European Union will, for their part, continue to participate actively in all appropriate forums and discuss transparency measures which can contribute to increased confidence and greater security among all United Nations Member States. In the period towards the next review of the operation of the Register, in 2009, which is the next opportunity for further development, the EU would like to stress the importance of bringing universal and consistent participation in the Register to the attention of United Nations Member States and collecting their input for the planned Group of Governmental Experts in 2009. In that respect, the Union believes that regional initiatives, such as regional United Nations workshops on transparency in armaments, may effectively raise the awareness and enhance the involvement of all United Nations Member States necessary for a successful review in 2009.
