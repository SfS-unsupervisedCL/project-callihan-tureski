UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/1165 15 November 1999 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 12 NOVEMBER 1999 FROM THE CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES A.I. OF THE PERMANENT MISSION OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL I have been instructed by my Government to lodge a strong protest at the decision of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in Kosovo and Metohija, the autonomous province of the Yugoslav constituent Republic of Serbia, on 8 November 1999, to establish a separate budget and a central budget authority for this Serbian province. His decision constitutes a flagrant violation of the provisions of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999 reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Kosovo and Metohija. I take this opportunity to recall the position of my Government presented in its memorandum on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) (S/1999/1124, annex), that it will not recognize decisions taken by the international security force (KFOR) or the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in gross violation of the provisions of said resolution reaffirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Bearing that in mind, I have the honour to transmit herewith the request of my Government that all such decisions be revoked and that UNMIK and KFOR be enjoined to implement strictly Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the relevant documents. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Vladislav JOVANOVIC Chargé d'affaires a.i.
