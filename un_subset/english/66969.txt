The Office of Internal Oversight Services exercises operational independence under the authority of the Secretary-General in the conduct of its duties, in accordance with Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations. The Office has the authority to initiate, carry out and report on any action that it considers necessary to fulfil its responsibilities with regard to its oversight functions. The Office assists the Secretary-General in fulfilling his internal oversight responsibilities in respect of the resources and staff of the Organization through monitoring, internal audit, inspection, evaluation and investigation. 30.2 The mandate of the programme is derived from General Assembly resolutions 48/218 B, 54/244 and 59/272, and the relevant provisions of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations (ST/SGB/2003/7) and of the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation (ST/SGB/2000/8). The Office works closely with the other relevant United Nations bodies, namely, the United Nations Board of Auditors, the Independent Audit Advisory Committee and the Joint Inspection Unit, to promote effective coordination and to minimize possible overlap and duplication of effort. 30.3 The Office strives to achieve accountability and transparency by supporting the Organization as it endeavours to establish an effective and transparent system of accountability and to enhance its capacity to identify, assess and mitigate risks. This will be accomplished through the issuance of timely, high-quality reports on inspections, evaluations, internal audits and investigations, in accordance with applicable international standards and its mandate, as approved by the General Assembly in resolution 48/218 B. 30.4 The Office assists the Organization in achieving better results by determining the factors affecting the efficient and effective implementation of programmes in accordance with intergovernmental mandates and, inter alia, the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals and those set out in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences held and in the international agreements adopted since 1992. In addition, the Office undertakes a number of measures to support the Organization's commitment to gender mainstreaming, including oversight of United Nations gender mainstreaming efforts. 30.5 The overall resources proposed for the biennium 2014-2015 for section 30 amount to $40,330,200 before recosting, reflecting a net decrease of $390,000 (1 per cent) compared with the 2012-2013 resources at revised rates. Resource changes result from the following three factors: (a) technical adjustments relating to the removal of non-recurrent requirements and addition of delayed impact for new posts approved in 2012-2013; (b) resource changes in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248; and (c) resource changes reflected in the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 2014-2015 (A/67/529 and Corr.1). 30.6 The distribution of resources is reflected in tables 30.3 and 30.4.

Table 30.5 Distribution of resources by component (Percentage) Other assessed Extrabudgetary Technical adjustments 30.7 Resource changes reflect the removal of non-recurrent requirements totalling $134,600 broadly related to the acquisition of proprietary software applications designed to establish a single global standardized case management system that would provide a centralized repository of information and ensure the accessibility of key information, the timeliness of access, accuracy and the consistency of data. The reduction is offset in part by an increase of $998,200 relating to the delayed impact of seven new posts that were established in the biennium 2012-2013 pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/246. 30.8 Resource changes of $1,119,300 are proposed in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248. The primary areas of resource changes, in the amount of $1,015,800, and the related impact are outlined in table 30.6. Table 30.6 Primary areas of resource changes in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248 Net reductions in inputs Description Reductions in the volume of outputs Reductions in performance targets Programme of work Subprogramme 1 Abolishment: 1 D-1 Service Chief 1 GS (OL) Administrative Assistant Subprogramme 2 1 D-1 Deputy Director Addition: General temporary assistance Subprogramme 3 1 P-2/1 Associate Investigator Streamlining of managerial and support functions Total net reduction: $1,015,800 The proposed abolishment of the posts of Service Chief (D-1), Deputy Director (D-1), Associate Investigator (P-2) and Administrative Assistant (GS (OL)) reflects the plan of the Office of Internal Oversight Services to streamline its managerial and support functions while maintaining its operational resources. This would mitigate to the extent possible direct impact on the implementation of its mandates. Changes to its management structure take into account the size of the organizational units, their respective workload requirements and empowerment of managers at the P-5 level with more responsibilities and accountability for the delivery of its mandates. Given the smaller size of the Inspection and Evaluation Division (22 regular budget and 3 extrabudgetary posts), which is based at Headquarters only, the structure of the Division will be streamlined so that management will be undertaken by a D-2 level post without the D-1 Deputy Director. However, in order to ensure an adequate transition to the new management arrangement, general temporary assistance has been provided on a non-recurrent basis to cover the requirements for the continued funding of the D-1 post for 2014. The smaller size of the Nairobi Internal Audit Division (4 regular budget, 5 extrabudgetary, and 3 Tribunal posts) and its existing workload would allow for management of the office at the P-5 instead of the D-1 level, with direct reporting requirements to the Service Chief (D-1) based in New York. The Assistant Secretary-General post would also assume more responsibility in managing the Internal Audit Division. The proposed abolishment of 1 Associate Investigator (P-2) and 1 Administrative Assistant (GS (OL)) post reflect further alignment of staffing requirements with workload requirements and redistribution of functions among existing posts. Changes reflected in the report of the Secretary-General on the budget outline for 2014-2015 30.9 Reductions in line with the Secretary-General's budget outline amount to $134,300. The primary reductions, in the amount of $124,800, are outlined in table 30.7. Table 30.7 Primary areas of resource changes in line with the Secretary-General's budget outline Programme support Reduction: Contractual services Reduction to reflect 2012-2013 expenditure patterns and costs for information and communications technology services Total reduction: $124,800 Reductions under general temporary assistance reflect actual expenditure experience and the provision of compensatory time off in lieu of overtime payments. Reductions under contractual services reflect lower costs for information and communications technology services such as mobile office accounts, hosting requirements and support to central data processing equipment in New York. Other assessed resources 30.10 The projected level of other assessed resources would amount to $61,736,700, representing 51 per cent of overall resource requirements. The resources would cover internal oversight activities related to the capital master plan project, the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and peacekeeping operations. The projected level represents an increase of approximately $15,004,500 over the biennium 2012-2013, arising mainly from increased requirements under the support account owing to the conversion of 51 general temporary assistance positions to posts, the application of a lower vacancy factor and increased common staff costs, as reflected in the Secretary-General's report on the budget for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (A/67/756). Extrabudgetary resources 30.11 The projected level of extrabudgetary resources would amount to $17,838,400, representing 15 per cent of overall resource requirements. The resources would cover internal oversight activities related to the United Nations funds and programmes, the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and technical cooperation activities. The projected level represents an increase of approximately $967,600 over the biennium 2012-2013, arising mainly from increased requirements under the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees relating to post costs and operational requirements under travel on official business. 30.12 The continued availability of other assessed contributions and extrabudgetary resources will have a large impact on the Office's ability to provide the expected level of audit, inspection, evaluation and investigative services to the respective funds and programmes, including technical cooperation activities, the capital master plan project, the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and peacekeeping operations, which will in turn enhance their ability to accomplish their objectives by advancing efficiency and accountability through the establishment of internal control mechanisms and continued observance of the respective rules and regulations governing each programme. 30.13 Under the framework of system-wide coherence, the Office coordinates regularly with other United Nations oversight entities, including the Board of Auditors and the Joint Inspection Unit, to ensure that potential gaps and unnecessary duplication and overlap in oversight work are minimized. In addition to sharing workplans, the Office holds bimonthly meetings with the Board of Auditors to discuss progress and issues of mutual interest. The Office also meets with the Joint Inspection Unit on an ad hoc basis when issues of particular concern arise. Furthermore, the senior representatives of those entities attend an annual tripartite meeting to discuss oversight coordination, among other issues. The Inspection and Evaluation Division continues to play a role in the larger evaluation community of the United Nations and serves as the Chair of the United Nations Evaluation Group, which promotes and strengthens evaluation functions in the United Nations. The Internal Audit Division contributes actively to the work and Meetings of the Representatives of Internal Audit Services of the United Nations Organizations and Multilateral Institutions. The Investigations Division continues to collaborate with and provide expert support to counterparts within the Organization. For example, the Division is involved in the current efforts aimed at further refining the Model Policy Framework for Agencies of the United Nations system to Consider for Vendor Sanction Procedures. In addition, the Division is represented in the Intersessional Working Group on Investigations, Disciplinary Matters and Administration of Justice, established in 2011 by the Staff-Management Coordination Committee, and in the working group addressing the revision of administrative instruction ST/AI/371 on disciplinary measures and procedures. 30.14 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269, resources totalling approximately $469,700 (regular budget) and $126,500 (other assessed) have been identified within the available capacity under executive direction and management and the programme of work for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation, comprising 37 work-months for the Professional category and 5 work-months for the General Service category. The requirements will provide for the discretionary and mandatory self-evaluation of the Office's activities, including the review of data input into the Integrated Monitoring and Documentation Information System, assessments of the quality of its reports and periodic reviews of its operations. 30.15 In line with General Assembly resolution 64/259 on accountability, the Office continues to improve its processes and procedures to meet the highest standards of quality, while delivering objective oversight results that make a difference. The divisions are subject to periodic external quality reviews that independently validate its work and, in the case of internal audit, ensure that the Office complies with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. Furthermore, the Office commissioned a four-person independent panel of outside experts to carry out a comprehensive review of the Investigations Division to assess its organizational structure, management and operations in achieving its mandate effectively and efficiently. The Office also engaged an external review team, including an expert panel, to examine how the Inspection and Evaluation Division carries out its functions for the Secretariat. 30.16 The impact of such evaluations has resulted in the identification of internal processes that can be improved to ensure the effective delivery of the services of the Office and improved accountability to Member States; and has allowed the programme to assess its compliance with the Internal Audit Manual, standards and code of ethics issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors, including the efficiency and effectiveness of the programme in meeting the needs of its various stakeholders. At the same time, the reviews have determined opportunities for improvement of various reports issued by the Office of Internal Oversight Services to enhance the overall quality of the reports through strengthened conclusions and respective recommendations. Resource requirements (before recosting): $3,206,500 30.17 The Office of the Under-Secretary-General provides overall strategic planning and monitoring and ensures the effective coordination of the workplan for the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The Office of the Under-Secretary-General coordinates the work of the three subprogrammes, undertakes liaison activities with the United Nations Board of Auditors and the Joint Inspection Unit and maintains a close working relationship with the other inspection and oversight services of the operational funds and programmes as well as with those of the United Nations system. Furthermore, it provides strict quality control over the reports of the Office to the General Assembly, oversees resource utilization and serves as the focal point on performance management and for compliance monitoring of recommendations of the Office. Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures Objective of the Organization: To ensure the efficient and effective implementation and management of the Office's programmes, activities and operations in accordance with the relevant legislative mandates, and to facilitate more transparency and accountability Expected accomplishments of the Secretariat Indicators of achievement (a) Increased timeliness of submission of documentation (a) Increased percentage of pre-session documents submitted in accordance with the required deadline Performance measures 2010-2011: 100 per cent Estimate 2012-2013: 100 per cent Target 2014-2015: 100 per cent (b) Continued cooperation with other oversight bodies in the United Nations (b) Maintenance of the number of activities carried out in collaboration with other entities 2010-2011: 11 meetings Estimate 2012-2013: 11 meetings Target 2014-2015: 11 meetings (c) Timely recruitment and placement of staff (c) Reduction in the average number of days a Professional post remains vacant 2010-2011: 182 days Estimate 2012-2013: 160 days Target 2014-2015: 150 days External factors 30.18 The Office is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that it receives timely feedback from clients and cooperation from external parties. Outputs 30.19 During the biennium, the following outputs will be delivered: (a) Servicing of intergovernmental and expert bodies (regular budget): General Assembly: (i) Substantive servicing of meetings of intergovernmental and expert bodies of the Fifth Committee (6); (ii) Parliamentary documentation: report on the activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services, and ad hoc reports to the Assembly on specific activities of the Office (2); (b) Conference services, administration and oversight (regular budget): organization of and follow-up to meetings (1); strategic planning and initiatives. 30.20 The distribution of resource requirements for Executive Direction and Management is reflected in table 30.9. Table 30.9 Resource requirements: executive direction and management Resources (thousands of United States dollars) Posts (before recosting) Post Non-post 30.21 The requirements of $3,206,500 comprise: (a) $2,807,000 for the continuation of eight posts (1 Under-Secretary-General, 1 Assistant Secretary-General, 1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 General Service (Principal level) and 2 General Service (Other level)); and (b) $399,500 under non-post resources. The increase of $265,300 under posts relates to the delayed impact of the new post at the Assistant Secretary-General level that was established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/246. 30.22 The increase of $199,900 proposed under non-post resources is due primarily to non-recurrent costs for the replacement of the current AutoAudit and Issue Track monitoring system, which would enable the Office to implement a web-based tracking system and significantly improve the current recommendation monitoring process. The project has been reviewed and approved by the Office of Information and Communications Technology. The cost of the replacement system will be shared with peacekeeping operations. As the system is planned for implementation in 2015, the peacekeeping portion of the costs will be proposed in the context of the proposed budget for the support account for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. 30.23 The distribution of resources by subprogramme is reflected in table 30.10. Table 30.10 Resource requirements Internal audit Resource requirements (before recosting): $15,433,900 30.24 Substantive responsibility for subprogramme 1 is vested in the Internal Audit Division. The subprogramme will be implemented in accordance with the strategy detailed under subprogramme 1, Internal audit, of programme 26, Internal oversight, of the biennial programme plan for the period 2014-2015. Table 30.11 Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures Objective of the Organization: To improve the Organization's risk management, control and governance processes (a) Increased contribution to the decision-making process of Member States, and increased ability of the Secretariat to take appropriate actions based on internal audits, which strengthen internal control and governance processes and improve risk management (a) (i) Increased acknowledgements of the Internal Audit Division's reports in the decision-making of Member States 2010-2011: 9 acknowledgements Estimate 2012-2013: 15 acknowledgements Target 2014-2015: 18 acknowledgements (ii) Maintained percentage of programme managers that express satisfaction with the accuracy and usefulness of the Internal Audit Division's reports 2010-2011: 72 per cent Estimate 2012-2013: 95 per cent Target 2014-2015: 95 per cent (b) Improved levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the implementation of mandates and enhanced accountability by programme managers (b) (i) Maintained percentage of critical audit recommendations accepted by programme managers relating to accountability, efficiency and effectiveness 2010-2011: 99.6 per cent (ii) Maintained percentage of audit recommendations implemented by programme managers 2010-2011: 67 per cent Estimate 2012-2013: 70 per cent Target 2014-2015: 70 per cent 30.25 The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that programme managers provide full support for the conduct of internal audits and accept recommendations. 30.26 During the biennium 2014-2015, the following final outputs will be delivered: (a) Servicing of intergovernmental and expert bodies (regular budget/other assessed/ extrabudgetary): (i) General Assembly: a. Substantive servicing of the Fifth Committee (4); b. Parliamentary documentation: audit reports on the basis of audits conducted (4); (b) Conference services, administration and oversight (regular budget/other assessed/ extrabudgetary): review compliance by departments and offices with audit recommendations (4); up to 450 final audit reports for programme managers during the biennium. 30.27 The resource distribution for subprogramme 1 is reflected in table 30.12. Table 30.12 Resource requirements: subprogramme 1 30.28 The amount of $15,433,900 comprises: (a) $14,163,000 for the continuation of 46 posts (1 D-2, 2 D-1, 5 P-5, 10 P-4, 10 P-3, 6 P-2, 4 General Service (Principal level) and 8 General Service (Other level)); and (b) $1,270,900 for non-post resources. The decrease of $606,600 under posts relates to the proposed abolishment of 1 D-1 Service Chief post and 1 General Service (Other level) Administrative Assistant post, in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248 (see table 30.6). The decrease of $250,800 under non-post resources relates primarily to reduced requirements under: (a) consultancy services resulting from the use of greater in-house expertise; (b) contractual services resulting from the narrow range of audit methodology development work planned for the biennium; and (c) travel of staff due to the increased use of video- and teleconferencing services in lieu of travel. 30.29 The subprogramme is supported by projected other assessed contributions of $36,220,400, providing for 87 posts (65 Professional, 4 General Service, 14 Field Service and 4 Local level), and extrabudgetary resources totalling $17,190,600, providing for 15 posts (9 Professional, 4 General Service and 2 Local level). The resources would support audit activities related to the United Nations funds and programmes, the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund, UN-Habitat, the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, technical cooperation activities and peacekeeping operations. The projected increase of $11,797,800 over the volume of resources estimated for the biennium 2012-2013 relates primarily to increased post costs under the support account for peacekeeping operations. Inspection and evaluation Resource requirements (before recosting): $8,015,600 30.30 Substantive responsibility for subprogramme 2 is vested within the Inspection and Evaluation Division. The subprogramme will be implemented in accordance with the strategy detailed under subprogramme 2, Inspection and evaluation, of programme 26, Internal oversight, of the biennial programme plan for the period 2014-2015. Table 30.13 Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures Objective of the Organization: To strengthen accountability, learning, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and impact in the implementation of programmes, as well as to ensure that outcomes of evaluation have a corresponding impact on strategic planning Increased contribution to the decision-making process of Member States, and increased ability of the Secretariat to take appropriate actions based on Office of Internal Oversight Services inspections and evaluations, including self-evaluations, that assess the relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of programmes and thematic issues (i) Increased percentage of programme and thematic inspections and evaluations that have contributed to more informed decision-making on relevance, efficiency and effectiveness in the implementation of programmes 2010-2011: not applicable Estimate 2012-2013: 59.2 per cent Target 2014-2015: 60.0 per cent (ii) Increased number of programmes evaluated and inspected Estimate 2012-2013: 5 Target 2014-2015: 7 30.31 The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that programme managers provide full support for the conduct of inspections and evaluations, accept recommendations and ensure full support for their implementation, and are open to advice and guidance provided through self-evaluations. 30.32 During the biennium 2014-2015, the following final outputs will be delivered: (a) Servicing of intergovernmental and expert bodies (regular budget): (i) General Assembly: substantive servicing of meetings, including those of the Fifth Committee on evaluation issues (14); (ii) Committee for Programme and Coordination: a. Substantive servicing of meetings of other intergovernmental and expert committees directly concerned with each programme evaluated (14); and substantive servicing of the Committee for Programme and Coordination (10); b. Parliamentary documentation; biennial report on strengthening the role of evaluation (1); in-depth evaluation reports (6); thematic evaluation reports on topics to be decided by the Committee for Programme and Coordination (1); and triennial review (1); (b) Conference services, administration and oversight (regular budget): (i) Inspections: five inspection reports; input to the annual report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (1); monitoring of the implementation of recommendations resulting from inspections on the status of implementation (1); and support for the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality (1); (ii) Evaluations: input to the annual report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services (1); in-depth evaluations (2); review of compliance by departments and offices with approved evaluation recommendations (2); support for the United Nations Evaluation Group (1); and client-requested evaluations (2). 30.33 The distribution of resource requirements for subprogramme 2 is reflected in table 30.14. Resource requirements: subprogramme 2 30.34 The amount of $8,015,600 comprises: (a) $6,564,300 for the continuation of 22 posts (1 D-2, 3 P-5, 5 P-4, 4 P-3, 5 P-2 and 4 General Service (Other level)), and (b) $1,451,300 for non-post resources. The net increase of $259,200 under posts relates to the delayed impact of 6 new posts (3 P-3 and 3 P-2) established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 66/248, offset in part by the proposed abolishment of the D-1 Deputy Director post in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248 (see table 30.6). In lieu of the abolished post, general temporary assistance has been provided on a non-recurrent basis for the continued funding of the D-1 post for the year of 2014, to ensure an effective transition to the new management arrangement, as reflected in table 30.6. 30.35 Projected other assessed contributions totalling $2,035,600, inclusive of three Professional posts funded therein, will be utilized for inspection and evaluation activities in support of peacekeeping operations. The projected increase of $53,100 over the volume of resources estimated for the biennium 2012-2013 relates primarily to increased post costs under the support account for peacekeeping operations. Investigations Resource requirements (before recosting): $11,071,000 30.36 Substantive responsibility for subprogramme 3 is vested in the Investigations Division. The subprogramme will be implemented in accordance with the strategy detailed under subprogramme 3, Investigations, of programme 26, Internal oversight, of the biennial programme plan for the period 2014-2015. Table 30.15 Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments, indicators of achievement and performance measures Objective of the Organization: To enhance accountability through investigations of possible violations of rules or regulations (a) Improved quality and timeliness of investigations to enable effective action to be taken in relation to misconduct (a) (i) Increased percentage of closure and investigation reportsa that meet timeline targets Estimate 2012-2013: 80 per cent (ii) Increased percentage of closure and investigation reports for which processes for applying corrective measures commence within 12 months (b) Increased awareness of United Nations personnel, including programme managers and others, to prevent or respond appropriately to misconduct (b) (i) Increased number of United Nations personnel responsible for investigations or investigation tasks who receive investigation training (ii) Increased number of overall awareness-raising activities aimed at informing United Nations personnel about the consequences of misconduct and the related mechanisms Estimate 2012-2013: 2 activities Target 2014-2015: 4 activities (iii) Increased percentage of cases reported to the Office by United Nations personnel Estimate 2012-2013: 50 per cent Target 2014-2015: 80 per cent a Reports in which misconduct has been substantiated. If misconduct is not substantiated, a closure report, not an investigation report, is issued. 30.37 The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that external parties will cooperate in investigations. 30.38 During the biennium 2014-2015, the following final outputs will be delivered: (a) Servicing of intergovernmental and expert bodies (regular budget): substantive servicing of the Fifth Committee (4); (b) Conference services, administration, oversight (regular budget/other assessed/extrabudgetary): internal oversight services: assessment of the potential within programme areas for fraud and other violations through the analysis of systems of control in high-risk operations as well as offices away from Headquarters (1); provision of assistance and advice on prevention of fraud and other acts of misconduct as well as waste of resources, abuse of authority and mismanagement (1); provision of assistance and expertise to programme managers and to the separately administered funds and programmes and investigation units of other international agencies to help them to meet their investigation needs (1); continuing improvements in the confidential reporting facility as instituted under administrative instruction ST/AI/397 (1); investigative oversight services relating to functions performed by United Nations staff in connection with missions established by the Security Council (1); management of a conservatively estimated 200 additional cases of theft, embezzlement, smuggling, bribery and other forms of misconduct as well as waste of resources, abuse of authority and mismanagement (1). 30.39 The distribution of resources for subprogramme 3 is reflected in table 30.16. 30.40 The amount of $11,071,000 comprises: (a) $10,071,000 for the continuation of 34 posts (1 D-2, 1 D-1, 3 P-5, 11 P-4, 7 P-3, 3 P-2, 2 General Service (Other level), 5 General Service (Principal level) and 1 Local level), and (b) non-post resources of $1 million. The net decrease of ($122,400) under posts relates primarily to the proposed abolishment of one P-2 Associate Investigator post in Vienna in line with General Assembly resolution 67/248 (see table 30.6). The decrease is offset in part by increased requirements under salaries and common staff costs related to the proposed redeployment of the following five posts within the subprogramme between duty stations: two P-2 Associate Investigator posts and one P-3 Investigator post (from Vienna to New York); one P-4 Investigator post (from Nairobi to New York); and one P-2 Associate Investigator post (from Vienna to Nairobi). 30.41 It will be recalled that, although a similar proposal was made by the Secretary-General in the context of the programme budgets for the bienniums 2010-2011 and 2012-2013 and supported by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (see A/64/7, paras. IX.21 and IX.23, and A/66/7, para. IX.12), the General Assembly, in its resolutions 66/246 and 64/243, in which it reaffirmed its resolution 63/287, did not support the Secretary-General's proposal. In the light of the Assembly's decisions taken in respect of the redeployments, it should be noted that the caseload in New York continues to increase over time compared with those in Vienna and Nairobi. The redeployments are proposed with a view to ensuring more effective utilization of resources that would meet the actual needs and demands for regular-budget-funded investigative activities in New York, Vienna and Nairobi. For 2011 and 2012, the intake of new cases included 84 in New York, 31 in Vienna and 30 in Nairobi. The time taken to conduct investigations varies; in some cases they can take more than 12 months to complete. As the majority of the functions often implicated in investigative activities, including, inter alia, administration, human resources and financial management, are centralized in Headquarters, a significantly greater number of cases are investigated at Headquarters compared with other locations. 30.42 The investigation capacity comprises 10 Investigator posts at Headquarters, 10 Investigator posts in Vienna and two Investigator posts in Nairobi. While there are five additional Professional posts at Headquarters carrying out other central functions related to forensics, quality assurance and legal support that are funded under the regular budget, the initial deployment of posts did not contemplate any such functions in either Vienna or Nairobi. The redeployment of posts across locations would reflect the alignment of staffing requirements with workload requirements and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of investigative operations. 30.43 The redeployment of the P-4 Investigator post from Nairobi to New York is therefore proposed to cover the demands related to the integration of procurement task force responsibilities and to provide further support in procurement matters for all offices. At the same time, the lesser demand for procurement investigations under the regular budget in Nairobi, with a substantial part of the caseload under the support account, will be covered by a P-2 Associate Investigator post from Vienna, where the capacity exceeds current demands. 30.44 The proposed redeployment of two P-2 posts and one P-3 post from Vienna to New York will address the increased qualitative demands on investigation reports and post-investigation support. These demands relate primarily to the new system of administration of justice, as it is expected that all investigation reports with adverse findings that result in a charge will require extensive post-investigation support, including both documentary and testimonial input for each case, which was not a requirement with the old system. In addition, even cases that are not investigated or are investigated and closed owing to lack of evidence can be appealed and require legal, operational and managerial support that was not previously required. Two P-2 posts will be redeployed to Headquarters as part of the Professional Practices Section, while one P-3 post will be utilized to strengthen the work of the Forensics Unit, with its Chief based in New York. 30.45 The reduction of $213,300 under non-post resources broadly relates to the decrease in travel of staff that takes into account past expenditure patterns and increased use of video- and teleconferencing services where feasible. 30.46 The subprogramme is supported by projected extrabudgetary resources of $647,800 and other assessed resources totalling $21,965,100. The resources will provide for 57 posts (44 Professional, 1 General Service (Principal level), 5 General Service (Other level), 6 Local level and 1 Field Service), that will be utilized for investigation activities related to the United Nations funds and programmes, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and peacekeeping operations. The projected increase of $3,915,400 over the volume of resources estimated for the biennium 2012-2013 relates primarily to increased post costs under the support account for peacekeeping operations, including the conversion of 51 general temporary assistance positions to posts. Resource requirements (before recosting): $2,603,200 30.47 Responsibility for providing backstopping support for the work of the internal oversight programme is vested in the Executive Office. 30.48 During the biennium, the following outputs will be delivered: provision of advice to senior managers of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on administrative, financial, personnel and budgetary matters (1); servicing of the Office of Internal Oversight Services review body (1); and administration of the Office of Internal Oversight Services staff and financial resources located at Headquarters, Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi and other duty stations, including the various peacekeeping missions and the Tribunals, under the delegation of authority granted by the Secretary-General (see ST/AI/401 and ST/AI/2003/4) and in accordance with the regulations and rules of the United Nations (1). 30.49 The distribution of resource requirements for programme support is reflected in table 30.17. 30.50 The amount of $2,603,200 comprises: (a) $1,892,500 for the continuation of eight posts (1 P-5, 1 P-4, 1 P-3, 1 General Service (Principal level) and 4 General Service (Other level)) totalling $2,603,200; and (b) non-post resources of $710,700. The decrease of $134,300 under non-post resources relates primarily to reductions under general temporary assistance and contractual services as reflected in table 30.7. 30.51 The subprogramme is supported by other assessed resources estimated at $1,515,600, including four posts (1 Professional and 3 General Service) that will provide backstopping support for the work of the internal oversight programme for activities related to peacekeeping operations. The projected increase of $205,800 over the volume of resources estimated for the biennium 2012-2013 relates primarily to increased post costs under the support account for peacekeeping operations. Brief description of the recommendation Action taken to implement the recommendation Board of Auditors (A/65/5 (Vol. I), chap. II) The Board recommends that the Office of Internal Oversight Services expedite the completion of its risk assessments of all the entities over which it has authority (para. 454). The Internal Audit Division completed the risk assessment process in 2011, and continues to review and revise these risk assessments on an ongoing basis. The Board recommends that the Office of Internal Oversight Services further increase its completion rate of audit assignments, inter alia, by reducing the rate of vacancy of its posts (para. 456). In progress: The Internal Audit Division has introduced new internal reporting and monitoring processes to provide real-time visibility to its management on progress made on various audit assignments, enabling management to take action if audit completion targets may not be met. The Division has reduced its vacancy rate and continues to work on expediting recruitment where possible.
