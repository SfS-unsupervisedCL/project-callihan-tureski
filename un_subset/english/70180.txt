The report, which was adopted by the Committee, is being submitted in accordance with the note by the President of the Security Council of 29 March 1995 (S/1995/234). (Signed) Masood Khan Chair Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia I. Introduction 1. The present report of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 (2003) concerning Liberia covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2013. For the webpage of the Committee, see www.un.org/sc/ committees/1521/index.shtml. 2. For 2013, the Bureau of the Committee consisted of Masood Khan (Pakistan) as Chair, with the delegations of Luxembourg and Rwanda serving as Vice-Chairs. During the reporting period, the Committee held three informal consultations (on 15 February, 23 May and 19 November 2013) to consider, inter alia, the midterm (S/2013/316) and final (S/2013/683) reports of the Panel of Experts on Liberia. II. Background 3. Previous sanctions regimes concerning Liberia were imposed by the Security Council by its resolutions 788 (1992) and 1343 (2001), respectively. In its resolution 1521 (2003), the Council decided to revise the legal basis of the sanctions to reflect the changed circumstances in Liberia, in particular the departure of former President Charles Taylor, the formation of the National Transitional Government of Liberia and progress with the peace process in Sierra Leone. Under resolution 1521 (2003), the Council dissolved the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1343 (2001) and established a new Committee to oversee the implementation of the measures as modified and reimposed by the same resolution: an arms embargo, restrictions on the travel of individuals designated by the Committee on the basis of the criteria contained in the resolution, and prohibitions on the import of rough diamonds and round logs and timber products originating in Liberia. By its resolution 1521 (2003), the Council also established a Panel of Experts, consisting of up to five members, to provide the Committee with information regarding the implementation of the measures and progress made towards meeting the conditions for the lifting of sanctions. On 16 March 2004, the Committee issued a new list containing the names of individuals subject to travel restrictions imposed by paragraph 4 of resolution 1521 (2003). 4. In order to prevent former Liberian President Charles Taylor, his immediate family members, senior officials of the former Taylor regime, or other close allies or associates designated by the Committee from using misappropriated funds and property to interfere in the restoration of peace and stability in Liberia and the subregion, the Security Council decided, under paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004), that all States would freeze without delay funds, other financial assets and economic resources owned or controlled directly or indirectly by Charles Taylor, Jewel Howard Taylor, Charles Taylor, Jr., and/or those other individuals designated by the Committee. On 14 June 2004, the Committee issued its initial list of individuals and entities subject to the measures contained in paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) (the assets-freeze list). By paragraph 5 of resolution 1532 (2004), the Council further decided that it would review the measures imposed by paragraph 1 of that resolution at least once a year; no expiration date for those particular measures was provided in the resolution, however. 5. A summary of the imposition and extension of the various sanctions measures (excluding the assets freeze) together with the mandates of the Panel of Experts is contained in the table below: Resolution number and date Arms embargo and travel ban extended for Diamond sanctions extended for Timber sanctions extended for Panel of Experts established/ extended for Symbols of Panel's reports Resolution 1521 (2003) 22 December 2003 12 months 5 months S/2004/396 and Corr.1 and 2 Resolution 1549 (2004) 17 June 2004 Not applicable 6 months S/2004/752 S/2004/955 Resolution 1579 (2004) 21 December 2004 S/2005/176 S/2005/360 Resolution 1607 (2005) 21 June 2005 S/2005/745 Resolution 1647 (2005) 20 December 2005 S/2006/379 Resolution 1689 (2006) 20 June 2006 (Not renewed) S/2006/976 Resolution 1731 (2006) 20 December 2006 S/2007/340 Resolution 1753 (2007) 27 April 2007 (Terminated) Resolution 1760 (2007) 20 June 2007 S/2007/689 Resolution 1792 (2007) 19 December 2007 S/2008/371 Resolution 1819 (2008) 18 June 2008 S/2008/785 Resolution 1854 (2008) 19 December 2008 S/2009/290 S/2009/640 Resolution 1903 (2009) 17 December 2009 S/2010/319 S/2010/609 Resolution 1961 (2010) 17 December 2010 S/2011/367 S/2011/757 Resolution 2025 (2011) 14 December 2011 S/2012/448 S/2012/901 Resolution 2079 (2012) 12 December 2012 S/2013/316 S/2013/683 Resolution 2128 (2013) 10 December 2013 6. Notably, by its resolution 1683 (2006), the Security Council, welcoming the leadership of the newly elected President and her efforts to restore peace, security and harmony throughout Liberia, modified the arms embargo to incorporate additional exemptions for the Liberian Special Security Service and, subject to advance approval by the Committee, for members of the Liberian police and security forces who have been vetted and trained since the inception of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) in October 2003. 7. By its resolution 1688 (2006), the Council decided that the travel restrictions imposed by resolution 1521 (2003) would not apply to former President Taylor for the purposes of any travel related to his trial before the Special Court for Sierra Leone, as well as any travel related to the execution of the judgement, and also to exempt from the travel ban the travel of any witnesses whose presence at the trial was required. 8. By its resolution 1689 (2006), the Council, concluding that sufficient progress had been made in meeting the conditions set out for terminating the measures on timber, decided not to renew the prohibitions on the import of round logs and timber products from Liberia; however, it also decided to review that decision after a period of 90 days and expressed its determination to reinstate the measures, unless forestry legislation as specified in the resolution had been passed. During the review, held on 20 October 2006, the members of the Council concluded that there was no basis for reinstating those measures as otherwise stipulated in the resolution. 9. By its resolution 1731 (2006), the Council, recognizing the need for newly vetted and trained Liberian security forces to assume greater responsibility for national security, and taking note of the need for Liberian armed forces to procure humanitarian, medical and/or training equipment, further modified the arms embargo to exclude supplies of non-lethal military equipment. 10. By its resolution 1753 (2007), the Council, concluding that sufficient progress had been made in meeting the conditions set out for terminating the measures on diamonds, decided to terminate those measures, almost two months ahead of their date of expiration as set by resolution 1689 (2006). 11. By its resolution 1792 (2007), the Council also decided that States would notify the Committee upon delivery of all arms and related materiel approved and supplied in accordance with paragraph 2 (e) of resolution 1521 (2003). 12. By its resolution 1903 (2009), the Council decided that for a period of 12 months the measures on arms shall not apply to the Government of Liberia and it renewed the measures for a period of 12 months with regard to all non-governmental entities and individuals operating in the territory of Liberia. In the same resolution, the Council also decided that all States shall notify the Committee in advance of any shipment of arms and related materiel to the Government of Liberia or of any provision of assistance, advice or training related to military activities for the Government of Liberia. 13. By its resolution 1961 (2010), the Council renewed the arms embargo on all non-governmental entities and individuals operating in the territory of Liberia and the travel ban for a period of 12 months. By the same resolution, the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts on Liberia until 16 December 2011, and included in the Panel's mandate a request to report on the implementation, and any violations, of the measures on arms as amended by resolution 1903 (2009). The Council also included in the Panel's mandate a request to assess the extent to which forests and other natural resources are contributing to peace, security and development rather than to instability and to what extent relevant legislation and other reform efforts are contributing to this transition, and to provide recommendations on how such natural resources could better contribute to the progress of Liberia towards sustainable peace and stability. 14. By its resolution 2025 (2011), the Council renewed the arms embargo on all non-governmental entities and individuals operating in the territory of Liberia and the travel ban for a period of 12 months. By paragraph 5 of the resolution, the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts on Liberia for the same period, and included in the Panel's mandate a request for the Panel to report on the implementation, and any violations, of the measures on arms as amended by resolution 1903 (2009). By paragraph 9 of resolution 2025 (2011), the Council reaffirmed the need for UNMIL and the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire (UNOCI) to regularly coordinate their strategies and operations in areas near the Liberia-Côte d'Ivoire border, in order to contribute to subregional security. 15. By its resolution 2079 (2012), the Council renewed the arms embargo on all non-governmental entities and individuals operating in the territory of Liberia and the travel ban for a period of 12 months. By paragraph 5 of the resolution, the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts on Liberia for the same period, and renewed in the Panel's mandate a request for the Panel to report on the implementation, and any violations, of the measures on arms as amended by resolution 1903 (2009). The Council also renewed in the Panel's mandate a request for the Panel to assess the extent to which forests and other natural resources are contributing to peace, security and development rather than to instability, and to cooperate actively with the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, including during a planned Kimberley Process mission in 2013. 16. By its resolution 2128 (2013), the Council renewed the arms embargo on all non-governmental entities and individuals operating in the territory of Liberia and the travel ban for a period of 12 months. The Council modified the notification requirements associated with the arms embargo, deciding that notification for non-lethal materials and associated training is no longer required and that the Liberian authorities shall have the primary responsibility to notify the Committee at least five days in advance of shipment of relevant supplies and the provision of assistance, advice or training to military or other security sector activities for the Government of Liberia. By paragraph 5 of the resolution, the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts on Liberia for the same period, to report on the implementation and violations of the measures on arms and progress in the security and legal sectors with respect to the ability of the Government of Liberia to effectively monitor and control arms and border issues and on the progress made by the Government with regard to meeting notification requirements. The Council requested the Secretary-General to reappoint the Panel, having due regard to the Panel's reduced mandate, to consist of two members. III. Summary of the activities of the Committee A. Requests for exemptions to the measures/notifications 17. During the reporting period, the Committee did not receive any requests for travel-ban waivers under paragraph 4 (c) of resolution 1521 (2003). 18. With respect to the assets freeze, the Committee received three notifications in connection with the exemption provisions contained in paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) of resolution 1532 (2004). In accordance with paragraph 2 (a) of that resolution, Australia notified the Committee of its intention to authorize the gaining of access to funds by an Australian citizen for basic expenses, to which the Committee did not object. Also in accordance with paragraph 2 (a) of resolution 1532 (2004), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified the Committee of its intention to grant a licence to authorize the use of funds necessary for basic expenses in connection with the incarceration of Charles Taylor, to which the Committee did not object. In accordance with paragraph 2 (b) of resolution 1532 (2004), the United Kingdom notified the Committee of its intention to grant a licence to authorize the use of funds necessary for extraordinary expenses in connection with the incarceration of Charles Taylor, to which the Committee did not object. 19. During the period under review, the Committee received nine notifications in accordance with paragraph 6 of resolution 1903 (2009), by which the Council decided that all States shall notify the Committee in advance regarding any shipment of arms and related materiel to the Government of Liberia, or any provision of assistance, advice or training related to military activities for the Government of Liberia. 20. The Committee received one notification concerning paragraph 5 (a) of resolution 1903 (2009), by which the Council decided that the sanctions measures would not apply to supplies of arms and related materiel as well as technical training and assistance intended solely for support of or use by UNMIL. 21. In accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 1683 (2006), the Committee received two communications from UNMIL transmitting reports on the results of the Mission's inspections of inventories of weapons and ammunition obtained in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of that resolution, in order to ensure that all such weapons and ammunition were accounted for. 22. Pursuant to paragraph 4 of resolution 2025 (2011), the Council directed the Committee, in coordination with the Government of Liberia and relevant designating States, and with the assistance of the Panel of Experts, to update the publicly available reasons for placing individuals and entities on the Committee's travel-ban and assets-freeze lists. On 21 January 2013, the Committee updated its lists on the basis of a communication from Australia. The Committee also updated its travel-ban list on 16 July, 6 September and 30 October 2013 on the basis of communications received from the Panel of Experts. In this regard, press releases were issued on 22 January (SC/10894), 22 July (SC/11069), 11 September (SC/11115) and 1 November 2013 (SC/11168). 23. The Committee received two delisting requests through the focal point process in 2013. The Committee accordingly delisted two individuals, on 29 November and 23 December respectively, and, in this connection, updated its travel-ban list on 29 November and 23 December 2013 and its assets-freeze list on 23 December 2013. The Committee also issued press releases on 3 December (SC/11197) and 23 December 2013 (SC/11229). 24. As at 23 December 2013, when it was last updated, the Committee's assets-freeze list includes the names of eight individuals and 30 companies, while the travel-ban list, last updated on 23 December 2013, includes the names of 23 individuals (for the lists, see the website of the Committee at www.un.org/sc/ committees/1521). C. Implementation of the sanctions regime 25. The Committee received two communications from Australia with information following the arrest of Richard Chichakli, an individual subject to the travel ban and the assets freeze, in the Australian State of Victoria on 10 January 2013. 26. The Committee received a communication from Singapore with information concerning an individual on the travel-ban and assets-freeze lists. 27. Communications were also received from the World Intellectual Property Organization, regarding its activities related to intellectual property to be undertaken in Liberia in 2013, and from Portugal, regarding legislative measures undertaken by the Portuguese Government. A request for information on the obligations of transit countries in respect to the arms sanctions pertaining to Liberia was received from the Czech Republic. 28. In its final report, prepared pursuant to paragraph 5 (f) of Security Council resolution 2079 (2012) (S/2013/683), the Panel of Experts reported several shortcomings in the capacity of the Government of Liberia to address arms embargo violations, including the failure of the Government to adequately mark weapons, the lack of the necessary national legal framework to prevent trafficking in illicit arms and ammunition and the incapacity of the Government to secure its borders to prevent arms trafficking. The Panel also expressed concerns regarding the illicit importation and transshipment of narcotics. It outlined challenges related to the absence of State authority outside Monrovia, including in the areas bordering Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire, as well as the potential danger posed by the presence of mercenaries in those areas. The Panel reported instances of recruitment of mercenaries for operations in Guinea and Mali. 29. Concerning the assets freeze and the travel ban, the Panel believed that the measures had limited the activities of sanctioned individuals since the travel ban prevented assets from being moved out of the country and made listed individuals feel that they were under international scrutiny. The targeted measures were therefore considered to have had some effect despite a lack of implementation of the assets freeze measures by the Government of Liberia. The Panel provided relevant information pertaining to individuals subject to the travel ban and the assets freeze, in particular sanctioned individuals living in Liberia and elsewhere in the subregion. 30. In its investigations regarding natural resources, the Panel found that diamond trafficking remained a matter of concern. The movement of diamonds through Liberia from Zimbabwe and the Central African Republic represented a new element of such trafficking. As recommended by the Panel during its previous mandate, a mission to review the functioning of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was undertaken in March 2013, but a report on the findings has not yet been submitted to the Government of Liberia. The Panel also reported that the alluvial gold sector remained weak and that, as a consequence, illegal mining of and trafficking in such gold continued almost entirely unhindered. 31. Concerning the agricultural sector, the Panel reported that palm oil concessions had generated conflict between local communities and large-scale concession holders. In the forestry sector, the Panel expressed concern about the lack of accountability for irregularities identified in the allocation of private use permits and the continued lack of oversight and governance of the sector. While the new national land rights legislation currently under consideration indicated that progress was being made, the Panel stressed that addressing the land tenure issue was critical for overcoming one of the principal and fundamental causes of civil conflict in Liberia. With regard to the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the Panel reported that extractive companies and government entities had improved their cooperation with the Initiative, enabling the mechanism to perform its mandate. D. Other activities 32. In response to letters sent from the Chair of the Committee in connection with the final report of the Panel of Experts, replies were received in 2013 from the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations. Following the informal consultations of the Committee on 15 February 2013, the Chair dispatched letters to the Permanent Representative of Liberia to the United Nations, the Permanent Representative of Côte d'Ivoire to the United Nations, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Chair of the Kimberley Process and the World Bank, reminding them of his letters and requesting replies by 15 May 2013. A letter was subsequently received from the World Bank. A response to a letter dispatched in connection with the final report of the Panel of Experts was also received from the Chair of the Liberia configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission. 33. Following the informal consultations of the Committee on 23 May 2013, during which the Panel of Experts presented the main findings contained in its midterm report (S/2013/316), the Chair dispatched letters on 10 June 2013 to the Permanent Representative of Liberia to the United Nations, the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations (copying the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Liberia and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Côte d'Ivoire), the Permanent Representative of Côte d'Ivoire to the United Nations, the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone to the United Nations, the Chair of the Kimberley Process and the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, drawing attention to relevant recommendations contained in the midterm report. Replies were subsequently received from the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations and the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. 34. The Chair briefed the Security Council on the work of the Committee and the findings of the midterm report of the Panel (S/2013/316) during the consultations of the Council on 13 June 2013. 35. Following the informal consultations of the Committee on 19 November 2013, during which the Panel of Experts presented the main findings contained in its final report (S/2013/683), the Chair dispatched letters on 13 December 2013 to the Permanent Representative of Liberia to the United Nations, the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations (copying the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Liberia), the Permanent Representative of Côte d'Ivoire to the United Nations, the secretariat of the Manu River Union, the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone to the United Nations, the United Nations Office for West Africa, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Chair of the Kimberley Process, the Chair of the Liberia configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission, the Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Recovery and Governance for Liberia, Resident Coordinator, Humanitarian Coordinator and Resident Representative, the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil, the Head of the Delegation of the European Union to the United Nations, the United Kingdom Department for International Development and the Head of the secretariat of the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. 36. During the informal consultations of the Committee on 19 November 2013, the Committee decided that the Chair would request a briefing by the Assistant Secretary-General for Rule of Law and Security Institutions on how the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and UNMIL, as well as relevant Member States, can assist with relevant recommendations made by the Panel. Furthermore, it was decided that the Chair would meet with the Permanent Representative of Liberia to the United Nations to discuss the status of implementation of the issues raised in the Panel's recommendations. 37. The briefing by the Assistant Secretary-General for Rule of Law and Security Institutions could not be arranged in December owing to time constraints. Consequently, the Chair of the Committee transmitted the information to the incoming Chair for follow-up. The Chair also dispatched a letter to the Assistant Secretary-General, on 16 December 2013, drawing his attention to the relevant recommendation and informing him that a briefing would take place in 2014 under the Committee's new chairmanship. The Chair met with the Permanent Representative of Liberia to the United Nations on 6 December and provided an update on this meeting in a note to Committee members on 13 December 2013. 38. The Chair briefed the Security Council on the work of the Committee and the findings of the final report of the Panel (S/2013/683) during the consultations of the Council on 5 December 2013. IV. Observations 39. The Committee continues to rely on the reporting of the Panel of Experts to monitor the implementation of the remaining sanctions measures and to keep abreast of various developments in the area of natural resources.
