Identical letters dated 14 September 2010 from the representative of Israel to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council I write to inform you of a series of incidents in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip that endanger the peace and stability of the region. Yesterday morning, 13 September 2010, two Qassam rockets were fired from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip towards Israel. The rockets, which landed in the Sha'ar Hanegev region, forced civilians to seek emergency shelter as the attacks intentionally targeted civilian areas. These latest incidents are only the latest in a series of attacks carried out by Hamas. On 10 September 2010 and 12 September 2010, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip exploded near a children's day-care centre and agricultural infrastructure, respectively. It appears that Hamas and other radical organizations utilize such violence in order to derail direct peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians that aim to forge a permanent and lasting agreement. As such, these attacks must be met with the firmest possible condemnation. Furthermore, in response to Hamas' dangerous actions, Israel will exercise its right of self-defence and will take all necessary measures to protect its citizens. I should be grateful if the present letter were circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Meron Reuben Ambassador
