Table 10.1 Estimates of expenditure Proposal submitted by the Secretary-General $6 665 500a Revised appropriation for 2010-2011 a At 2010-2011 rates. Table 10.2 Proposed staffing resources Posts Number Level Regular budget Proposed for the biennium 2012-2013 1 USG, 1 D-2, 1 D-1, 3 P-5, 5 P-4, 2 P-3, 1 P-2/1, 4 GS (OL) Approved for the biennium 2010-2011 Abbreviations: USG, Under-Secretary-General; GS, General Service; OL, Other level. 10.1 The legislative authority for the programme derives from General Assembly resolutions 55/279, by which the Assembly endorsed the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010 ("Brussels Programme of Action"), adopted at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Brussels in May 2001, and 56/227, whereby the Assembly decided to establish the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States in accordance with the recommendations of the Secretary-General (see A/56/645 and Add.1 and Add.1/Corr.1 and 2). 10.2 The mandate of the programme covers four main elements: (a) Mobilization and coordination of international support and resources for the effective implementation of: (i) the new programme of action for the least developed countries, to be adopted at the forthcoming Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, in May 2011; (ii) the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries; and (iii) the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States; (b) Enhanced monitoring and follow-up of the three programmes of action; (c) Awareness-raising and advocacy with respect to the three groups of countries (least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States) and the related programmes of action; (d) Reporting on the implementation of the new programme of action for the least developed countries and the Almaty Programme of Action as effective tools for reaching the international development goals of the countries concerned. 10.3 The programme will also contribute to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences and international agreements. It will mobilize international support in favour of its three groups of constituencies in the areas of capacity-building and increased technical and financial resources in promoting sustained growth and sustainable development. Gender is an important dimension in the implementation of the three programmes of action. 10.4 The overall programme of work of the Office of the High Representative is designed around three interdependent and complementary subprogrammes, namely: subprogramme 1: Least developed countries; subprogramme 2: Landlocked developing countries; and subprogramme 3: Small island developing States. 10.5 With a view to addressing the objectives in each of the three main areas of endeavour, the Office of the High Representative will use a combination of the following approaches and strategies: (a) Raising awareness and advocating that the concerns of the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States be placed high on the global development cooperation agenda in order to maintain the focus on their special needs and ensure that global economic governance, coherence and solidarity are brought to bear on the problems and challenges relating to these three groups of vulnerable countries; (b) Mobilizing international support and resources in favour of the three groups of countries to help them overcome their vulnerabilities, build resilience and set themselves on a path of economically, socially and environmentally sustained and sustainable development; (c) Monitoring and following up in order to foster supportive policies in groups of countries in special situations and their development partners in accordance with their respective programmes of action and other internationally agreed development goals; (d) Working with organizations of the United Nations system and other international organizations, including regional organizations, the donor community and civil society, to ensure the mainstreaming of the priorities identified in each of the three programmes of action; (e) Supporting the effective participation of the least developed countries in intergovernmental processes, including through the articulation of their needs, concerns and interests, and continuing to make the case that these three groups of countries deserve special consideration and treatment in order to overcome their vulnerabilities; (f) Building partnerships towards the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action by establishing coordinating mechanisms at the national, subregional and global levels; (g) Monitoring and coordinating the implementation of specific actions and initiatives with the aim of establishing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries; (h) Promoting South-South cooperation in various areas for the benefit of the countries of the three groups; (i) Reaching out to all stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, to enhance support for the three groups of countries; (j) Maximizing synergies among the three subprogrammes based on the common problems and challenges faced by the three groups of countries, which include structural weaknesses, vulnerability to external shocks, small economies, a marginal position in the world economy and geographical disadvantages. 10.6 The Office of the High Representative carries out its activities in cooperation with other departments and offices of the Secretariat, entities of the United Nations system and entities external to the United Nations, including the system of national focal points for the implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action. In particular, collaboration with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa and the regional commissions are of major importance for the Office of the High Representative in effectively discharging its mandate. The United Nations resident coordinator system is instrumental in the country-level implementation of the three programmes of action. 10.7 The Office of the High Representative has sought to maximize efficiency by enhancing collaboration between the subprogrammes. For example, the terms of reference used in commissioning consultancies often include data and analyses not only for the least developed countries but also for landlocked developing countries and small island developing States. Additionally, thematic studies often cover more than one category of country. 10.8 The Office's mandate for system-wide coordination on issues relating to the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States has been carried out effectively, especially in the context of mobilizing all agencies in support of the three programmes of action under the Office's mandate. The Office and several United Nations and other entities have jointly implemented and continue to jointly implement many advocacy, capacity-building and resource mobilization activities. In addition, with a view to maximizing efficiency in the fulfilment of its mandates, the Office has increasingly made use of videoconferencing to facilitate consultations with and deliver outputs to Member States and United Nations and other entities. The Office will continue to use videoconferencing and other information and communications technology tools. 10.9 In 2008, the Secretary-General realigned, on an experimental basis, the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa and the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. The realignment aims to reinforce advocacy efforts and promote greater inter-agency coordination and donor contact to mobilize support for programmes dedicated to Africa's development and to the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States; to streamline operations and eliminate duplication and overlap so as to increase the focus on Africa's development and the specific needs of the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States; to amplify efforts to raise awareness and maintain political momentum for addressing the challenges facing these countries with special needs; and to maximize the use of resources in the delivery of United Nations support for countries with special needs. 10.10 Following up on the outcomes and recommendations that will arise from the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, the Secretary-General intends to provide Member States with an assessment of the impact of the realignment on both Offices since it was initiated in 2008, with the aim of determining the programme and section configuration, design and mandates that could be considered by the General Assembly. 10.11 In its resolution 63/260, the General Assembly provided the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States with three additional P-4 posts, which have strengthened the capacity of the Office to undertake its development-related activities, in particular with regard to the substantive preparations for the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries by (a) supporting the least developed countries to prepare an outcome document that addresses those countries' development needs; (b) assisting landlocked developing countries in launching the Multilateral Agreement for the Establishment of an International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries to improve analytical capability in the areas of transit policy, infrastructure development and maintenance, and international trade and trade facilitation; and (c) advocating the special need for small island developing States to establish an initiative aimed at supporting those States' efforts to reduce their heavy dependence on imported fossil fuel for energy. The three posts have also enhanced the research capacity of the Office and thus played an important role in the preparation of the outcome documents of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. 10.12 The overall resources required for the biennium 2012-2013 under this section amount to $6,665,500 before recosting, reflecting a decrease of $740,600 (or 10 per cent) owing to the discontinuation of the one-time provisions approved in the biennium 2010-2011. The decrease shown in table 10.5 can be summarized as follows: (a) The decrease of $2,000 under executive direction and management reflects the net effect of decreased requirements arising from the discontinuation of a non-recurrent provision under furniture and equipment for the preparation of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries ($4,800), partially offset by increased requirements under contractual services for Citrix licences for business continuity ($2,800); (b) The decrease of $738,600 under programme of work comprises: (i) the discontinuation of a non-recurrent provision for general temporary assistance for the preparation of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries ($692,900) and (ii) the discontinuation of a non-recurrent provision for travel of staff to service the regional preparatory meetings for the Conference ($45,700). 10.13 One of the functions of the Office of the High Representative relates to the mobilization of extrabudgetary resources for the implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action, the Brussels Programme of Action, the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ("Barbados Programme of Action") and the Mauritius Strategy, as well as other initiatives for least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States. During the biennium 2012-2013, projected extrabudgetary resources amounting to $1,486,000 will complement resources from the regular budget to finance various activities, including the ten-year review of the Almaty Programme of Action; the participation of national focal points of least developed countries in the substantive sessions of the Economic and Social Council; and the meetings and workshops for following up on the implementation of the new programme of action for the least developed countries. A net decrease of $3,078,000 for the biennium 2012-2013 compared with the revised estimate of $4,564,000 for the biennium 2010-2011 relates mainly to reduced requirements owing to the completion of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. 10.14 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269, resources identified for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation would amount to $112,400, reflected under executive direction and management (equivalent to half of one work-month each at the levels of D-2 and D-1, to one work-month at the level of P-5 and to eight work-months at the level of P-4). 10.15 The issue of publications as part of the programme of work has been reviewed in the context of each subprogramme. It is anticipated that recurrent and non-recurrent publications will be issued as summarized in table 10.3 below and in the information on outputs for each subprogramme. Table 10.3 Summary of publications Publications actual estimate Recurrent Non-recurrent Total 10.16 It is estimated that the resources of the programme in the biennium 2012-2013 will be distributed between the programme's two components as shown in table 10.4.

He engages in high-level consultations with Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, multilateral financial institutions and civil society groups, approves reports and assists the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly in their reviews and assessments of progress achieved in the implementation of the programmes of action for the three groups of countries. 10.18 The Office assists the High Representative in discharging his responsibilities and provides overall administrative support services related to the programme of work.

Table 10.12 Resource requirements: subprogrammes 1 to 3 10.31 The amount of $4,109,400 comprises: (a) $3,914,700 for the continuation of 12 posts (1 D-1, 2 P-5, 5 P-4, 2 P-3, 1 P-2 and 1 General Service (Other level)); and (b) $194,700 for other, nonpost, staff costs, the engagement of consultants and experts, travel of staff and contractual services. The decrease of $738,600 under non-post requirements relates to the discontinuation of a non-recurrent provision of general temporary assistance for the preparation of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries ($692,900) and the discontinuation of a non-recurrent provision for travel of staff to service the regional preparatory meetings for that Conference ($45,700). 10.32 During the biennium 2012-2013, extrabudgetary resources estimated at $1,486,000 will complement resources from the regular budget to finance various activities, including the 10-year review of the Almaty Programme of Action; to enhance the participation of national focal points from least developed countries in the substantive sessions of the Economic and Social Council; and to hold meetings and workshops to follow up on the implementation of the new programme of action for the least developed countries. Extrabudgetary resources will be utilized for consultancy services, studies, publications, travel of experts, representatives and staff, contractual services, and hospitality. A net decrease of $3,078,000 for the biennium 2012-2013 against the revised estimates of $4,564,000 for the biennium 2010-2011 relates mainly to reduced requirements owing to the fact that the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries will have taken place. Table 10.13 Summary of follow-up action taken to implement relevant recommendations of the oversight bodies Brief descriptionof the recommendation Action taken to implement the recommendation Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (A/64/7) IV.24 The Committee would welcome a detailed description of the Office's new donor strategy and looks forward to that description in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013. A new donor strategy will be finalizedreflecting the outcomes and recommendations of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries to be held in May 2011. The strategy will aim to mobilize funds to facilitate the effective implementation of the programme of action that will be adopted at the Conference. Office of Internal Oversight Services (E/AC.51/2009/2) 52.
