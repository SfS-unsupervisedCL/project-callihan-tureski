Fifty-sixth session Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003* Part II Political affairs Section 6 Peaceful uses of outer space (Programme 4 of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005) Contents Page Overview Programme of work Annex Indicative resource requirements * The present document contains section 6 of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003. The approved programme budget will subsequently be issued in final form as Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 6 (A/56/6/Rev.1). 6.1 In 1959, when space activities were in their infancy, the General Assembly recognized the need for a mechanism to ensure broad international cooperation in space activities. By its resolution 1472 (XIV) of 12 December 1959, the Assembly established the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and mandated it to promote international cooperation in space activities, to organize mutual exchange and dissemination of information on outer space research, to encourage and assist the development of national space programmes and to study the nature of legal problems that might arise from the exploration of outer space. That mandate was reaffirmed by the Assembly in its resolution 1721 (XVI) of 20 December 1961, in which it confirmed its belief that the United Nations should provide a focal point for international cooperation in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. The Assembly requested the Committee, in cooperation with the Secretary-General and making full use of the Secretariat, to maintain close contact with organizations concerned with space activities, as well as to provide for information exchange and assistance in the study of measures for promoting international cooperation in space. Those resolutions, along with the recommendations of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE III), convened in July 1999, are the basis for activities that have evolved under programme 4, Peaceful uses of outer space, of the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 (A/54/6/Rev.1). The activities are implemented by the Office for Outer Space Affairs, located in Vienna. 6.2 The scope and importance of space applications have already expanded to cover a wide range of applications that are essential to operational communications; weather forecasting; management of land and ocean resources; preparedness, early warning and mitigation of disasters; environmental monitoring; distance education; medical and health services in remote and rural areas; and other social and economic activities in every country. Space technology has become an integral part of daily human activities and will further contribute to improving conditions of life for humanity in the new millennium. 6.3 While the end of the cold war enhanced opportunities for international cooperation in space activities between various countries, many countries with space capabilities are experiencing greater difficulty in justifying public spending for costly space projects. Offsetting this trend, there has been an expansion of the various space-related services provided by the private sector on a commercial basis. The private sector now plays an important role in utilizing the benefits of space technology and enhancing international cooperation through commercial activities. Therefore, the important role of the private sector in implementing the programme on the peaceful uses of outer space will be taken into account. 6.4 Although the benefits of space science and technology for social and economic development are widely recognized in the international space community, many of those living in poverty in developing countries have yet to experience such benefits in their daily lives. The programme on the peaceful uses of outer space will advocate the need for greater efforts to be made at the global level to show clearly how space science and technology can meet the basic needs of people living in poverty and how space applications can improve the living condition of individuals. The programme will also promote the need for recognition by decision makers involved in social and economic development, particularly those in developing countries, of the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of space applications and of the benefits derived from integrating them into socio-economic development plans. 6.5 International cooperation in the use of space technology constitutes an important part of United Nations efforts to promote sustainable development. It will need to be enhanced further in order to ensure that new space technologies benefit all people and do not increase the gap between the rich and the poor. As a result of the expansion and diversification of space activities and the changing international political and economic environment, involving non-State players in space activities, the United Nations will have to address important new political, social, economic, technological and legal issues. 6.6 During the biennium, the Office for Outer Space Affairs will focus its activities on implementing the recommendations of UNISPACE III, taking into account the strategy to address global challenges as articulated in the resolution entitled "The Space Millennium: Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development", adopted by UNISPACE III. In this regard, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 55/122 of 8 December 2000, the Office will work towards the full implementation of the plan of action adopted by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space at its forty-third session. By the end of the biennium, the Office will have initiated activities to strengthen the role of the Committee and its subcommittees in promoting international cooperation in the use of outer space; initiated a capacity-building programme in areas relating to space law; increased synergy among training and educational activities, technical advisory services and a fellowship programme within the framework of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications; contributed to the increased use of space science and technology within the United Nations system; contributed to the increased involvement of non-State actors in carrying out space activities for the benefit of developing countries; initiated a public outreach programme and a programme for young people; and expanded its publication and information services. 6.7 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55/122, the Office will increase its efforts to ensure that the benefits of space technology and its applications are prominently brought to the attention of conferences organized within the United Nations system to address global issues relating to social, economic and cultural development and that the use of space technology is promoted with a view to achieving the objectives of those conferences and implementing the United Nations Millennium Declaration (General Assembly resolution 55/2). 6.8 The overall level of resources for the biennium 2002-2003 amount to $3,691,400 before recosting, reflecting a growth of $377,900 (11.4%). 6.9 The distribution of resources is summarized in tables 6.1 and 6.2.

In implementing the programme, the Office will take into account the strategy to address global challenges in the future, as articulated in the Vienna Declaration, as well as the measures contained in the plan of action of the Office to implement recommendations of UNISPACE III, agreed to by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. 6.11 In the Vienna Declaration, UNISPACE III called for action to encourage all States to provide their children and youth, especially females, through appropriate educational programmes, with opportunities to learn more about space science and technology and their importance to human development and to participate fully in activities related to space science and technology as an investment in the future. In implementing the programme on the peaceful uses of outer space, the Office for Outer Space Affairs will follow the strategy for achieving gender equality in space as articulated in the Vienna Declaration. In selecting participants in workshops, training courses and fellowships, due regard will be given to gender balance with a view to contributing to the advancement of women in space-related fields. Table 6.3 Objectives for the biennium, expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement Objective: To deepen the understanding of the international community with respect to ongoing space activities and the role that space technology can play in economic and social development, as well as to facilitate the use of space science and technology in solving problems of regional or global significance, with an emphasis on its application for sustainable development within and outside the United Nations system and taking into account the strategy to address global challenges in the future, as articulated in the resolution entitled "The Space Millennium: Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development", adopted by UNISPACE III, as well as the measures agreed to by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to implement the recommendations of the Conference.
