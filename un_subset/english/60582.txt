Letter dated 29 March 2011 from the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council I have the honour to forward the attached communications, dated 23, 25 and 29 March 2011, respectively, which I have received from the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen (see annexes). The letters convey notifications related to NATO activities pursuant to Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). I should be grateful if you would bring the letters to the attention of the members of the Security Council. (Signed) BAN Ki-moon Letter dated 29 March 2011 from the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Secretary-General Following my letters of 23 March 2011 and 25 March 2011, I am writing to inform you of the decision taken by the North Atlantic Council on 27 March 2011 for NATO to take action in accordance with Security Council resolution 1973 (2011) to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya. Consistent with all relevant paragraphs of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011), particularly paragraph 4, the main effort by the Alliance through this operation is to take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack by the Libyan forces. As in the case of the NATO operations in support of the arms embargo and to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya, the North Atlantic Council has made clear that it will welcome support of and participation in this operation by non-NATO countries. At the end of the necessary transition period, NATO will therefore be conducting, under single command, a unified effort in response to, and strictly in accordance with, Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). (Signed) Anders Fogh Rasmussen Letter dated 25 March 2011 from the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Secretary-General Following my letter of 23 March 2011, I am writing to inform you of the decision taken by the North Atlantic Council yesterday, 24 March 2011, for NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya pursuant to Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). As in the case of NATO's operation in support of the arms embargo, the North Atlantic Council has made clear that it will welcome support of and participation in this operation by non-NATO countries. The enforcement of a no-fly zone over the coastal region of Libya is meant to prevent the use of force against civilian populations by the Libyan regime, consistent with paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). We expect this operation to commence by 27 March 2011. Letter dated 23 March 2011 from the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Secretary-General I am writing to inform you of the decision taken by the North Atlantic Council on 22 March 2011 to commence a NATO operation in support of an arms embargo against Libya pursuant to Security Council resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011). The North Atlantic Council has made clear that it will welcome support of and participation in this operation by non-NATO countries. The main effort by the Alliance through this operation is to assist the international community in reducing the flow of arms and material prohibited by the arms embargo into and from Libya in order to help prevent attacks on the civilian population. The NATO contribution, which contains both a maritime and air component, will be conducted from the maritime flank of Libya in and over the central Mediterranean Sea; it includes surveillance and monitoring activities as well as enforcement of the embargo with respect to suspect vessels and aircraft that are reasonably believed to be carrying cargo in violation of the arms embargo.
