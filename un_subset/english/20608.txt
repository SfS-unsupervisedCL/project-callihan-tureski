"The Security Council notes the progress made in the implementation of resolution 1244 (1999) and the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self-Government, including the inauguration of the Kosovo Assembly following the elections on 17 November 2001 in Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It calls on Kosovo's elected representatives to resolve the deadlock over the formation of executive structures of the provisional self-governing institutions and to allow the functioning of those institutions, in accordance with the Constitutional Framework and the outcome of the elections which expressed the will of the voters. It supports the development of cooperation between UNMIK, Kosovo's elected representatives and the authorities in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Such cooperation is vital in implementing resolution 1244 (1999). "The Security Council reaffirms the fundamental importance of the rule of law in Kosovo's political development and condemns any attempt to undermine it. It supports all efforts of UNMIK, together with the international security presence (KFOR) and the Kosovo Police Service (KPS), to combat all kinds of crime, violence and extremism. It supports the measures taken to bring persons responsible for criminal acts to justice, regardless of ethnic or political background. It calls upon the elected leaders of Kosovo to cooperate fully with UNMIK and KFOR in promoting the rule of law and a multi-ethnic Kosovo with security and freedom of movement for all."
