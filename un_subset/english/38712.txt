Letter dated 15 September 2006 from the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council Further to my letter of 1 September 2006 on the subject of Myanmar (see annex), known to the United States as Burma, and to our subsequent discussions with Council members, I would like to specifically confirm my request for a meeting of the Security Council during September but after 19 September under an item entitled "The situation in Myanmar" for members of the Council to receive a briefing from the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Ibrahim Gambari, on the situation in that country and the status and progress of the Secretary-General's good offices mission. I would appreciate your circulating this letter as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) John R. Bolton The United States and other members of the Security Council are concerned about the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, known to the United States as Burma, and this situation is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. In his briefing to the Council in December 2005 and June 2006, Under-Secretary-General Gambari described the grave human rights and humanitarian conditions in Burma, including the detention of over 1,100 political prisoners, as well as the outflow from Burma of refugees, drugs, HIV/AIDS, and other diseases. These conditions threaten to have a destabilizing impact on the region. Therefore, we request that the situation in Myanmar, known to the United States as Burma, be placed on the Council's agenda, and that a senior official of the Secretariat formally brief Member States at a meeting of the Security Council on this situation and its implications for international peace and security.
