Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) Note verbale dated 13 June 2002 from the Permanent Mission of Sweden to the United Nations addressed to the Chairman of the Committee The Permanent Mission of Sweden to the United Nations presents its compliments to the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 751 (1992) and has the honour to report on the action taken by the Government of Sweden in accordance with paragraph 8 of resolution 1407 (2002). Regarding the measures in place to ensure the full and effective implementation of the arms embargo against Somalia, this Mission has the honour to inform the Committee that, according to Swedish legislation, permits for the export of defence materiel must be granted in each specific case. Sweden, therefore, already has a strict export control in this respect and arms embargoes are automatically applied. No such exports to Somalia are granted in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolutions.
