Letter dated 30 June 2011 from the Permanent Representative of France to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to refer to Security Council resolution 1973 (2011), adopted on 17 March, as well as my letters of 18 March (S/2011/150), 22 March (S/2011/175), 29 March (S/2011/212) and 26 April 2011 (S/2011/274) concerning the measures authorized by paragraphs 4 and 8 of resolution 1973 (2011) "to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack" and "to enforce compliance with the ban on flights imposed by paragraph 6" (of the resolution). I wish to inform you that France has recently taken an additional measure in accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 1973 (2011): airdrops of self-defence weapons for the civilian populations that have been victims of attacks by Libyan armed forces, in the absence of any other operational means of protecting these populations under threat. I should be grateful if this letter could be circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) GÃ©rard Araud
