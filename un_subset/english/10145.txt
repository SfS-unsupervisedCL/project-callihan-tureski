UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1999/658 8 June 1999 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 7 JUNE 1999 FROM THE CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES A.I. OF THE PERMANENT MISSION OF YUGOSLAVIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL I have been instructed by my Government to inform you that the terrorists of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army, supported by the armed forces of the Republic of Albania and the air force of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), continue to carry out armed attacks from the Republic of Albania against the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Army of Yugoslavia defending the country's border. On 4 June 1999, mortar fire was opened from the border area of Koldet in the Republic of Albania against the units of the Army of Yugoslavia defending the border in the region of Mrcaj (peak elevation 2,250 metres) in the Junik Mountains, on which occasion one soldier was killed and three were wounded. In the night of 5 June 1999, with extensive air support by NATO, the armed groups of the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army carried out from the border area of the Republic of Albania an attack against the units of the Army of Yugoslavia defending the border in the Djakovica and Prizren sectors in the directions of Morina and Vrbnica. Additional forces are being deployed and re-grouped from deep within the territory of the Republic of Albania, the probable aim of which is the infiltration of the territory of the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, specifically the autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija. I should be grateful if you would have the present letter circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Vladislav JOVANOVIC Chargé d'affaires a.i.
