Parties are invited to note that there are some modifications in the proposed allocation of items as well as in the proposed schedule. The latter are designed to ensure that work is begun as early as possible, that some conclusions and/or decisions are recommended by the subsidiary bodies for adoption by the COP on Friday, 6 November 1998 and that the subsidiary bodies complete their work by the close of their sessions on 10 November 1998. GE.98-64227 English Page FCCC/CP/1998/1/Add.1 English With regard to the provisional agenda for COP 4 (FCCC/CP/1998/1, pages 3-6), the attention of the secretariat has been drawn to the possibility of the words “international emissions trading” in item 5 (a) (iv) being understood as a reference to global trade in emissions, and not simply a way to distinguish Article 17 trading from domestic trading. To avoid further misunderstanding of this terminology, the deletion of the words in parentheses will be proposed when the agenda is presented for adoption. For the sake of consistency, the deletion of the words in parentheses after item 5 (a) (iii) of the provisional agenda for COP 4 will also be proposed.
