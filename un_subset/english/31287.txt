D. Programme support Annex Outputs produced in 2004-2005 not to be carried out in the biennium 2006-2007 4.1 General and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control remains the ultimate goal of all efforts exerted in the field of disarmament. The main responsibilities for disarmament lie with Member States. The United Nations, in accordance with its Charter, has a central role and primary responsibility in supporting Member States in this area. The Department for Disarmament Affairs is responsible for the implementation of the programme. 4.2 The activities for which the Department for Disarmament Affairs is responsible fall within the framework of programme 3, Disarmament, of the biennial programme plan for the period 2006-2007. The mandate for the programme derives from priorities established in General Assembly resolutions and decisions in the field of disarmament, including the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament (resolution S-10/2). The programme is also guided by the United Nations Millennium Declaration (General Assembly resolution 55/2) and takes into account other relevant resolutions of the United Nations. While weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, continue to be the primary concern, the Organization will also continue its work in the field of conventional disarmament. 4.3 For the biennium 2006-2007, the Department will continue to facilitate the process of multilateral deliberation and negotiation. It will assist Member States in promoting, strengthening and consolidating multilaterally negotiated principles and norms in all areas of disarmament. Attention will also be given to efforts of Member States in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation in order to help maintain international peace and security and to contribute to global efforts against terrorism. The Department will promote and facilitate the implementation of the Programme of Action adopted at the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, as well as practical disarmament measures. It will also promote transparency and confidence-building measures and will expand its outreach activities, including through its website, to ensure the flow of impartial and factual information to the public. The Department will implement disarmament and non-proliferation education programmes, and will continue to encourage the exchange of information on and experience in disarmament and security-related matters among organizations of the United Nations system, Member States, other intergovernmental organizations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations and to enhance interaction and cooperation on such matters. It will also assist Member States in promoting regional approaches to disarmament and security, including through the regional centres for peace and disarmament. It will continue to contribute to efforts to enhance disarmament expertise in Member States, particularly developing countries. 4.4 The Department will seek to achieve the objectives of the programme by providing substantive organizational support to deliberative and negotiating bodies and their subsidiary bodies, as well as review conferences, other meetings of States parties to multilateral agreements on disarmament and related matters and expert groups assisting the Secretary-General in undertaking disarmament studies. This will include monitoring and assessing current and future trends in the field of disarmament and international security. 4.5 Training and advisory services will continue to be provided, through the United Nations disarmament fellowship, training and advisory services programme and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, to Member States, in particular developing countries, to enhance their expertise in disarmament, with a view to participating more effectively in international deliberating and negotiating forums. The Department will also assist Member States in increasing their understanding of the relationship between disarmament and development. 4.6 The Department carries out its activities in cooperation with other departments and offices of the Secretariat, entities of the United Nations system and entities external to the United Nations, including treaty organizations, intergovernmental, interregional, regional and national organizations, non-governmental organizations, academic communities, etc. Such cooperation includes the preparation of reports, participation in meetings, briefings, technical and substantive support and sharing of information and experience. 4.7 Gender mainstreaming will continue to be built into the activities of the programme through the implementation of a gender plan of action aimed at raising awareness, commitment and capacity for gender mainstreaming in disarmament affairs. This will include encouraging Member States to nominate more female candidates for expert groups, the disarmament fellowship programme and other meetings and events organized by the Department, as well as focusing on gender perspectives in the area of disarmament. 4.8 The expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement for the Department in the biennium 2006-2007 are detailed, together with resources under executive direction and management and the programme of work. The overall framework of these expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement is shown in table 4.1. Table 4.1 Framework of expected accomplishments and indicators of achievement by component Component Number of expected accomplishments Number of indicators of achievement Subprogramme 1. Multilateral negotiations on arms limitation, disarmament and non-proliferation Total 4.9 The issue of publications as a part of the programme of work has been reviewed in the context of each subprogramme. It is anticipated that recurrent and non-recurrent publications will be issued as shown in table 4.2 below in summary and as distributed in the output information for each subprogramme. Table 4.2 Summary of publications Publications actual estimate Recurrent Non-recurrent 4.10 The overall level of resources for the Department for Disarmament Affairs for the biennium 2006-2007 amounts to $18,749,800, at 2004-2005 rates, reflecting growth of $9,900 (0.1 per cent). The growth in table 4.4 can be summarized as follows: (a) The net decrease of $12,000 under executive direction and management relates to reduced requirements in non-post items; (b) The net decrease of $35,700 under programme of work relates to: (i) A decrease of $184,000 under subprogramme 1 resulting from the abolition of a General Service (Other level) post; (ii) A net decrease of $52,300 under subprogramme 2 comprising a reduction in non-post requirements ($219,800) due to fewer ad hoc expert group meetings, partially offset by the delayed impact of a new post (P-5) established in the biennium 2004-2005 ($167,500); (iii) A net increase of $2,500 under subprogramme 3 comprising $185,800 for a new P-5 post, partially offset by a net decrease in non-post requirements of $183,300 due mainly to the discontinuation of one-time requirements for 2004-2005; (iv) An increase of $93,000 under subprogramme 4 for non-post requirements in connection with a panel of experts mandated under General Assembly resolution 59/60 of 3 December 2004; (v) A net increase of $105,100 under subprogramme 5 comprising an increase of $226,900 for the delayed impact of a new post (D-1) established in the biennium 2004-2005, offset by a reduction of $121,800 for one-time provisions for the strengthening of safety and security in 2004-2005; (c) The increase of $57,600 under programme support for non-post requirements is due to the implementation of a cost-sharing mechanism to finance the cost of central data-processing infrastructure services and support. 4.11 The estimated extrabudgetary resources, amounting to $7,309,500, include the amount of $3,055,400 for the trust fund for the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR). 4.12 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 58/269 of 23 December 2003, resources identified for the conduct of monitoring and evaluation would amount to $223,200 (reflected under executive direction and management and all subprogrammes). 4.13 The percentage distribution of resources under this section is as shown in table 4.3.

Following the expansions of its membership in 1996 and 1999, the Conference is open to the five nuclear-weapon States and 60 other States, including key militarily significant States. In addition, every year some 40 non-member States are invited, upon their request, to participate in its work. The Conference on Disarmament conducts its work by consensus, adopts its own rules of procedure, rotates its presidency among all its members every four weeks, adopts its own agenda taking into account the recommendations made to it by the General Assembly and the proposals presented by the members of the Conference, and submits a report to the General Assembly annually, or more frequently as appropriate. The Conference divides its 24-week annual session into three parts and, if necessary, continues its negotiations on priority issues between sessions. Meetings thus may take place during six to nine months each year. 4.16 Pursuant to paragraph 120 (c) of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, the Secretary-General, following consultations with the Conference on Disarmament, appoints the Secretary-General of the Conference, who also acts as his Personal Representative, to assist the Conference and its Presidents in organizing the Conference. As requested by the Assembly in its resolution 34/83 L of 11 December 1979, the Secretary-General provides staff, as well as the assistance and services needed by the Conference on Disarmament and any subsidiary bodies that it might establish, in accordance with the arrangements contained in its rules of procedure. The secretariat of the Conference consists of officers of the Conference on Disarmament secretariat and Conference Support Branch (Geneva) of the Department for Disarmament Affairs. 4.17 The Conference on Disarmament successfully concluded the negotiation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (1992) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (1996), with the participation of all five nuclear-weapon States and other militarily significant States. The Conference is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the priorities on the contemporary international disarmament agenda in order to reach an agreement on a programme of work, which will include deliberations and negotiations on a number of disarmament issues on its agenda. Table 4.6 Resource requirements Resources (thousands of United States dollars) Posts (before recosting) Non-posts 4.18 The non-post resources provide for travel of Geneva-based officials to attend meetings of the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies as well as other consultations and meetings hosted at Headquarters. Resource requirements (before recosting): $2,805,200 4.19 Executive direction and management of the programme consists of the Office of the Under-Secretary-General and the Office of the Director. 4.20 The Office of the Under-Secretary-General is responsible for the implementation of the programme of work, as well as for the overall direction, supervision and management of the Department, including its financial and administrative activities. The Under-Secretary-General provides the Secretary-General with advice and support on all disarmament and related security matters, represents him in that respect, as required, and provides authoritative analysis and assessment of developments in the field of disarmament and international security for policy guidance and decision-making purposes. 4.21 In the exercise of his responsibilities, the Under-Secretary-General is assisted by the Director, who acts as deputy and assumes charge of the Department in the absence of the Under-Secretary-General. The Director provides support to the Under-Secretary-General on executive direction and management of the Department; ensures efficient coordination and the delivery of the programmatic mandates of the Department; and advises the Under-Secretary-General and makes recommendations on all substantive, organizational, administrative, personnel and budgetary matters. The Office of the Director is responsible for coordinating the work of the Department and its outputs. The Director is accountable to the Under-Secretary-General.

Resource requirements: subprogramme 2 4.30 The amount of $2,013,700, reflecting a growth of $167,500, will provide for the continuation of eight posts. The growth relates to the delayed impact of a new post (P-5) established in the biennium 2004-2005. The non-post resources will provide for other staff costs, consultants and experts and travel of staff. The decrease in non-post requirements ($219,800) reflects lower requirements for ad hoc expert groups because fewer meetings are to be held in 2006-2007. Subprogramme 3 Conventional arms (including practical disarmament measures) Resource requirements (before recosting): $2,871,700 4.31 The Conventional Arms Branch is responsible for the implementation of the subprogramme. The primary areas to be covered are small arms and light weapons, including the operation of the Coordinating Action on Small Arms mechanism; the operation and progress of the arms transparency instruments of the United Nations on international arms transfers and military expenditures; disarmament and development; and emerging trends and developments in the field of conventional weapons.

Table 4.15 Resource requirements: subprogramme 3 4.35 The amount of $2,381,700, reflecting an increase of $185,800, will provide for the continuation of nine posts augmented by the proposed establishment of one new P-5 post. The requested new post is needed to strengthen the capacity of the Branch in providing appropriate guidance and supervision to the practical implementation of all activities related to conventional arms. The incumbent of this post will be responsible for the whole spectrum of practical disarmament issues under the mandate of the Department. The non-post requirements, reflecting a reduction of $183,300, will provide for other staff costs, consultants, experts and travel. The decrease relates to the discontinuation of the non-recurrent requirements approved for the biennium 2004-2005 in connection with activities mandated under General Assembly resolution 58/241 of 23 December 2003 on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, partially offset by increases in other staff costs, consultants and travel due mainly to requirements relating to the 2006 review conference on the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Subprogramme 4 Monitoring, database and information Resource requirements (before recosting): $2,572,900 4.36 The subprogramme is implemented by the Monitoring, Database and Information Branch, which will continue to provide objective, impartial and up-to-date information on multilateral disarmament issues and activities to its end-users: Member States, States parties to multilateral agreements, intergovernmental organizations and institutions, departments and agencies of the United Nations system, research and educational institutions, civil society, especially non-governmental organizations, the media and the general public. 4.37 Outreach activities carried out under this subprogramme cover all aspects of multilateral disarmament, with emphasis on the Department's substantive priority areas of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, particularly small arms and light weapons. The Branch will continue to carry out information and education activities in coordination with the other branches and departments, most notably the Department of Public Information, as well as with civil society organizations, especially non-governmental and academic organizations. The Department will continue to foster implementation by Governments, other United Nations organizations and civil society organizations of the recommendations of the 2002 United Nations study on disarmament and non-proliferation education, and increase its own activities in this regard. The subprogramme will continue to expand its use of the electronic medium for dissemination and exchange of information with specialized web pages and e-mailing lists.
