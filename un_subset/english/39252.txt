(Signed) Stefania Barbieri Head, Legal Department Registration of objects launched into outer space* SSETI Express Name of space object: COSPAR designator: 2005-043E Name of launching authority: European Space Agency (ESA) Date of launch: 27 October 2005 Location of launch site: Plesetsk, Russian Federation Orbital parameters Nodal period: 98.67 minutes Inclination: 98.19 degrees Apogee: 707 kilometres Perigee: 682 kilometres General description of the space object: SSETI Express is the first pan-European student microsatellite, built by a team of university students and radio amateurs distributed throughout Europe (within ESA's Student Space Exploration and Technology Initiative) and sponsored by the Education Department of ESA. The SSETI Express mission is an educational mission that will deploy CUBESAT pico-satellites developed by universities, take pictures of Earth, act as a test-bed and technology demonstrator for hardware of the complementary project -- the European Student Orbiter -- and function as a radio transponder for the rest of its mission duration. Venus Express 2005-045A ESA 9 November 2005 Baikonur, Kazakhstan Orbital parameters: Heliocentric transfer orbit to Venus Venus Express will study the Earth's nearest planetary neighbour. In particular, Venus Express will study the Venusian atmosphere and clouds in unprecedented detail and accuracy. GIOVE A 2005-051A 28 December 2005 840.98 minutes 56.05 degrees 23,281 kilometres 23,228 kilometres GIOVE A, or Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element A, is the first Galileo demonstrator in orbit, marking the very first step to full operability of Europe's new Global Navigation Satellite System.
