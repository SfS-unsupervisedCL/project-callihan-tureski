The review of Slovakia was held at the 11th meeting on 3 February 2014. The delegation of Slovakia was headed by Peter Javorčík, State Secretary, Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs. At its 17th meeting held on 6 February 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on Slovakia. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Slovakia: Ethiopia, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Slovakia: (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/SVK/1); (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/SVK/2); (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/18/SVK/3). A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Slovakia through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process A. Presentation by the State under review In its introductory remarks, the delegation of Slovakia expressed the view that the outcome of the universal periodic review provided national authorities with important guidance on how to enhance the protection of human rights, which was one of the main strengths of the review process. The delegation made a brief presentation of its national report, with a focus on how the recommendations from the first cycle of the universal periodic review had been addressed and on the main developments that had taken place in the last four years. As a follow-up to the first cycle, all recommendations had been subject to thorough consideration by the relevant national authorities. A number of legislative and practical measures had been adopted to implement those recommendations during the reporting period. While acknowledging the remaining challenges in some areas, the delegation expressed the commitment of the Government of Slovakia to continuing its efforts to achieve further progress in the institutional and legal framework related to human rights. Furthermore, the delegation reiterated the commitment of the Government to continuing the dialogue with civil society, including by involving its representatives in discussions on policies and programmes relating to human rights. The delegation reported that civil society was involved in the preparation process of the national report through the Government Council for Human Rights, National Minorities and Gender Equality. The draft national report was presented to members of the Council and was discussed by the Council at one of its sessions. In addition, civil society representatives and the public were given an opportunity to provide their comments on the consolidated version of the national report during the consultation process. The delegation also presented the main developments that had taken place since the first cycle of the universal periodic review. Some positive changes had been made in the institutional framework related to human rights. For example, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs had undertaken more responsibility in respect of human rights policies by taking on the role of coordinator of human rights policies and by chairing the Government Council for Human Rights, National Minorities and Gender Equality, which is a forum for regular discussions between Government representatives, civil society and human rights experts. The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs in its new coordinating role had served to ensure the effective division of tasks and responsibilities among the line ministries in the field of human rights and an efficient follow-up to the issues discussed. During the reporting period, important legislative amendments to the Anti-discrimination Act were adopted, with a view to further strengthening protection against discrimination, including widening the scope of the definition of indirect discrimination. By establishing the Committee for the Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Persons in October 2012, the Government responded to the need to ensure better awareness of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. As a multi-ethnic country Slovakia had made efforts to create a suitable environment for the preservation and protection of national minorities. In this respect, the Government had been actively engaged in a dialogue with international human rights monitoring bodies, in particular those of the Council of Europe, and had benefited from the invaluable expertise of those bodies when adopting and implementing national policies regarding the rights of national minorities. The dialogue with the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and with the Council of Europe Venice Commission on particular thematic issues served as a positive example in this regard. The Government Plenipotentiary for National Minorities had been established in 2012 to, inter alia, ensure adequate follow-up to recommendations made by regional human rights mechanisms on national minorities. Having in mind the absence of a comprehensive concept paper on human rights, the Government had initiated the drafting of a national strategy for the promotion and protection of human rights. In the preparatory stage, a broad discussion on further improvements in the situation of human rights had been initiated, involving various governmental and non-governmental actors. The Government was planning to complete the drafting of the strategy by June 2014. During the reporting period Slovakia had ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and its Optional Protocol and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (OP-ICESCR). As regards the question of ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CPED), the delegation stated that all necessary legislative amendments had been adopted and the national ratification procedure was under way. Slovakia had also ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure in December 2013. The delegation stated that Slovakia had started the process of ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse. The relevant legal process had been initiated for the ratification of the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which remained a priority, and the Government expected to complete the ratification of the amendments in 2014. The delegation stated that the situation on the rights of the Roma required further efforts to achieve satisfactory results from a human rights, social and economic perspective. In general, improving the situation of the Roma minority had been a long-term priority for the Government. The Strategy for Roma Integration up to 2020, which was adopted in 2012, represented the primary comprehensive policy paper for the social integration of the Roma and provided a basis for adopting the policies in four main areas of integration: health, employment, housing and education. As noted by the delegation, the Government acknowledged the need for a comprehensive approach to the process of integration of the Roma. Despite slow progress in this field, there had been several positive examples, in particular with regard to housing, health and employment. The delegation stated that a number of challenging tasks remained to be completed. The establishment of a national human rights institution in line with the Paris Principles had been among the most pressing objectives. Necessary legislative steps were expected to be taken in the near future. Finally, a procedure to establish a national independent institution for the rights of the child was under way and the first legislative draft was expected in the first half of 2014. B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review During the interactive dialogue, 67 delegations made statements. Recommendations made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. The Russian Federation noted the adoption of programmes to safeguard the rights of minorities and the enactment of legislation concerning non-discrimination.

It made recommendations. Albania noted the strengthening of human rights bodies within public institutions, the drafting of strategies and amendments to existing legislation, particularly in the key area of anti-discrimination. It commended the ratification of CRPD and its Optional Protocol and the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.

Austria commended Slovakia for the numerous efforts undertaken since the last review. It was, however, concerned about the pace of implementation of the Strategy for Roma Integration. Austria made recommendations. The delegation stated that the improvement in the situation of the Roma remained among the priorities of the Government. In 2012, the Strategy for Roma Integration up to 2020 was approved to address the challenges of social inclusion of Roma communities. The Revised National Action Plan of the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005 - 2015 (updated for 2011 - 2015) was considered as the action plan of the Strategy in four priority areas: education, employment, health and housing. The Strategy had envisaged cooperation with civil society, including cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working on the rights of the Roma. The Office of the Government Plenipotentiary for Roma Communities was assigned to supervise the implementation of specific policies, programmes and projects of the Strategy. Segregation based on ethnicity and discrimination was explicitly prohibited by the Anti-discrimination Act and by the School Act. The domestic legal framework provided full guarantees for the equal treatment of all children in education regardless of their ethnic or other origin. A number of systematic measures had been adopted to promote education, including free preschool education, specialized classes with compensatory and development programmes, financial assistance and subsidies for children of parents in material need. The Ministry of Education had adopted two internal regulations that clearly instructed schools and school facilities to refrain from any form of discrimination, exclusion or segregation of children. The delegation responded to a question regarding the court judgment concerning the segregation of Roma children in a school in eastern Slovakia. As a follow-up to the ruling of the court, concrete measures aimed, inter alia, at promoting the integration of children, in particular in school canteens and school yards, had been adopted. As regards the construction of so-called "anti-Roma" walls, the delegation indicated that Slovakia denounced and prohibited segregation and "ghettoization" of any kind. Municipalities and local authorities were systematically requested by the relevant national bodies to prevent the construction of walls that would separate parts of municipalities where the Roma lived from those where the majority population lived. Municipalities had been strongly encouraged to work actively with Roma communities. The delegation stated that housing was a major issue, as there were more households than housing units in Slovakia. With a 97 per cent rate of home ownership, it had been difficult for State bodies to intervene directly in the housing market to ensure that low-income families had access to housing. The Government had adopted measures to create the necessary conditions to ensure availability of housing for vulnerable groups, including the Roma. Due to the State programme for housing, subsidies for social rental housing had been allocated to municipalities to make housing rents affordable for low-income families, including Roma communities. Land ownership for the Roma remained a problem. In the countryside, property had been fragmented into small sections of private property and groups of Roma might be settled on land belonging to various owners. The delegation reported on the draft building code, which envisaged a plan for ensuring land ownership for the Roma. The new legislation on the provision of social benefits concerned only the provision of assistance in material form. A person might be entitled to this benefit on condition that he or she carried out some community services or work amounting to 32 hours a month. The projects entitled "Field social work in municipalities" and "Community centres" were among other activities aimed at reducing the level of poverty. A project on increasing employment and the employability of disadvantaged jobseekers with the objective of providing employment services to jobseekers from socially excluded communities was in progress. In 2013, the Government approved the National Action Plan for the Prevention and Elimination of Violence against Women for 2014 - 2019, which included solutions for institutional support for victims of violence against women and domestic violence. Additionally, in January 2014, the Government approved the National Strategy for the Protection of Children against Violence which aimed, inter alia, to establish a national coordination framework for addressing violence against children. Azerbaijan commended the signing and ratification of CRPD and its Optional Protocol.

Contraceptives and other methods of family planning were widely available throughout the country and the cost could be covered by public and private health insurance based on medical justification, which enabled an individual assessment of the health risks to be taken into account, as well as ensuring effective use of public health-care funds. In response to a question concerning lengthy court proceedings, the delegation referred to the resolution of 2012 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe related to judgements against Slovakia on violations of article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Committee of Minsters had emphasized that Slovakia had taken sufficient measures, including legal amendments in the period from 2007 to 2010, leading to a decrease in the length of civil proceedings since 2004. The delegation stated that several measures had been taken jointly by the Constitutional Court, the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court and the Bar Association to ensure the effective enforcement of orders by the Constitutional Court to other courts to expedite proceedings with significant delays. For example, the Constitutional Court had been maintaining a register of cases which had excessive lengthy proceedings. The Ministry of Justice and the courts had taken the responsibility of monitoring those cases. Disciplinary penalties could be imposed on judges and lawyers in such cases. Additionally, the drafting of a new civil procedure code had been initiated, with the objective of introducing new mechanisms to accelerate civil proceedings. The delegation provided information on the measures taken to address issues of transparency and corruption in the judiciary, including improvements in legal aid services and changes to the Law on Judges. The publication on the website of the Ministry of Justice of all decisions of the courts had become mandatory. In response to a query on delays in the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the delegation reported that Slovakia, as one of the first signatories of the Convention, had started the process of necessary legal amendments to enable the ratification of the Convention. The parliament had adopted a number of amendments to relevant laws that had been drafted based on the recommendations of international human rights mechanisms, including the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Slovakia had adopted the National Action Plan for the Prevention and Elimination of Violence against Women. A draft document on the proposal for ratification of the Convention had been submitted for broad consultation in September 2013. Bearing in mind that comments had been received from more than 100 NGOs, the Government had decided to continue discussion of the document. The delegation stated that the Constitution prohibited discrimination on any grounds and that the Anti-discrimination Act provided further protection from discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation. In 2012, the Committee for the Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Persons had been established with a mandate to contribute to further promotion of the rights of such persons. It was chaired by the Ministry of Justice and consisted of 24 members representing State bodies and NGOs. The Committee had been actively involved in human rights policymaking.

The Government was in the process of identifying suitable candidates for the Plenipotentiary for National Minorities in close consultation with the representatives of national minorities. Human rights training had been an important part of the measures undertaken to ensure that the police functioned in line with human rights standards. However, cases of excessive use of force by police had been still reported. The internal inspection structure within the Ministry of Interior had been in place to investigate such allegations, in addition to the investigations carried out by the Prosecutor's Office. Regarding the questions on combating extremism, the delegation stated that several steps had been taken. The necessary legislative amendments had been adopted with a view to enhancing the fight against extremism, including the 2013 amendments to the Criminal Code.
