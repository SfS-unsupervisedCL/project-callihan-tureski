Advisory services, technical cooperation and field activities Subprogramme 4. Supporting the Human Rights Council, its subsidiary bodies and mechanisms Legislative mandates 20.1 The overarching objective of the United Nations human rights programme is to promote and protect the effective enjoyment by all of all human rights. Its mandate derives from Articles 1, 13, 55 and 62 of the Charter of the United Nations; the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, including its principles and recommendations, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights and subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/121; Assembly resolution 48/141 establishing the post of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; international human rights instruments adopted by the United Nations; the outcomes of relevant United Nations conferences and summits; and the resolutions and decisions of policymaking bodies, including, in particular, Assembly resolutions 55/2 and 65/1 on the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 57/300 on strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for further change, 60/1 on the 2005 World Summit Outcome and 60/251 and 65/281 on the Human Rights Council and its review. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) will also be guided by international humanitarian law, as applicable. 20.2 The programme is guided by the principles of universality, objectivity, impartiality, indivisibility and non-selectivity in removing obstacles to the full realization of all human rights and in preventing the continuation of human rights violations, including with relevant parties. It undertakes to give practical effect to the will and resolve of the world community, as expressed through the United Nations, including in the Millennium Declaration, the 2005 World Summit Outcome and the 2010 High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, which acknowledged peace and security, development and human rights as interlinked and mutually reinforcing pillars of the United Nations system, providing foundations for collective security and well-being, and recognized that the respect for and promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of effective work towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The United Nations human rights programme has a role in making development equitable, sustainable and responsive to the needs of people and in relation to conflict prevention and resolution. 20.3 The programme falls under the leadership of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, entrusted with the principal responsibility for the human rights activities of the Organization, under the direction and authority of the Secretary-General and within the framework of the overall competence, authority and decisions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights acts as the central supportive structure for the programme. 20.4 Priority will continue to be given to emphasizing the importance of human rights on international and national agendas, combating poverty and countering discrimination on all internationally recognized grounds, including race, sex, language or religion, advancing the rights of children and women, raising awareness of human rights at all levels of education, responding to the needs of the vulnerable for protection and addressing situations of international concern, in particular gross and systematic violations of human rights, as identified by the Human Rights Council and other relevant United Nations organs. 20.5 The continued engagement of OHCHR with countries is essential to the realization of the programme in the framework of the enhanced partnerships at the national, regional and international levels. Increased support for human rights implementation will continue to be provided to requesting Member States through mutually agreed bilateral frameworks, outlining, inter alia, assistance to national systems of human rights protection, national capacity-building, technical cooperation, human rights education and learning and other relevant activities. The programme will continue to take gender issues fully into account in the development and application of norms and procedures so that violations against women and girls are clearly identified and addressed. 20.6 Strengthened and consolidated organizational support will be provided to the Human Rights Council and its subsidiary bodies and mechanisms, including the universal periodic review, special procedures, the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee and complaint procedure, as well as other relevant United Nations organs. The United Nations treaty-monitoring bodies, all serviced by OHCHR, will receive strengthened support and advice. 20.7 The programme strategy will be guided by the lessons learned from the biennium 2012-2013, in particular with regard to measurements of achievement that can be implemented realistically by OHCHR.
