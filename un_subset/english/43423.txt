In addition, in line with paragraph 4 of UNSCR 1737, New Zealand's Regulation will give New Zealand the discretion to prohibit the provision of any further items that New Zealand determines would contribute to Iran's enrichment-related, reprocessing or heavy water related activities, or development of nuclear weapons delivery systems, or other topics about which the IAEA has expressed concerns or identified as outstanding. 5 The New Zealand authorities are already exercising vigilance under commitments entered into as a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime to ensure that exports to Iran for these purposes does not take place.

Paragraph 17 All States to exercise vigilance and prevent specialized teaching or training of Iranian nationals, within their territories or by their nationals, of disciplines which would contribute to Iran's proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and development of nuclear weapon delivery systems 12 Paragraph 17 calls upon States to exercise vigilance and prevent specialised teaching or training within New Zealand or by New Zealanders of Iranian nationals of disciplines which could contribute to Iran's proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and development of nuclear weapon delivery systems. Persons applying to study in New Zealand in disciplines which could contribute to proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and development of nuclear weapon delivery systems are subject to rigorous screening procedures to ensure that such studies do not contribute to such activities.
