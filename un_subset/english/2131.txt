98-04772 (E) 250398 United Nations A/52/804 General Assembly Distr.: General 25 February 1998 Original: English Fifty-second session Agenda item 122 (b) Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in the Middle East: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon Report of the Secretary-General Summary The present report contains the financial performance report of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) covering the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, for which resources amounting to $125,722,800 gross ($122,665,800 net) were provided. Corresponding expenditures amount to $126,744,400 gross ($123,504,400 net), resulting in additional requirements of $1,021,600 gross ($838,600 net). Of the additional requirements, an amount of $639,356 relates to the incident at Qana and will be charged to the financial authorization granted under the terms of paragraph 7 of General Assembly resolution 51/233 of 13 June 1997. The remaining additional requirements in the amount of $382,244 gross ($199,244 net) are attributable mainly to the upward revision in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective 1 March 1997; the share of UNIFIL towards the financing of the United Nations Logistics Base, Brindisi; and the recording of certain expenditures pertaining to the financial period ending 30 June 1996 in the reporting period. The action to be taken by the General Assembly as contained in paragraph 12 of the report includes an additional appropriation and assessment of $382,244 gross ($199,244 net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997.

Authorized staffing and actual deployment of military and civilian personnel for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 1. The Security Council, by its resolution 1151 (1998) of 30 January 1998, extended the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to 31 July 1998. 2. The financial provision for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 to maintain the operation of UNIFIL was approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 50/89 B of 7 June 1996, which appropriated to the Special Account for UNIFIL the amount of $125,722,800 gross ($122,665,800 net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, and apportioned the same amount among Member States. 3. Column 1 of annex I to the present report sets out by budget line item the cost estimates for maintaining UNIFIL for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, as contained in annex I to the report of the Secretary-General of 20 February 1996 (A/50/543/Add.1). The apportionment of the appropriation of $125,722,800 gross ($122,665,800 net) provided under resolution 50/89 B is shown in column 2. Non-recurrent and recurrent expenditures are shown in columns 3 and 4, respectively. The expenditures recorded for the period are shown in column 5. Unliquidated obligations are shown in column 6. Variances, which reflect differences between the apportionment of resources and the actual expenditures, are shown in column 7 and result in additional requirements of $1,021,600 gross ($838,600 net) inclusive of the costs directly attributable to the incident at Qana on 18 April 1996 ($209,251) and costs related to the relocation of the Fiji battalion headquarters ($430,105). 4. Supplementary information on the financial performance report is presented by budget line item in annex II. The authorized staffing, incumbency and vacancy rates for civilian and military personnel for the reporting period are shown in annex III. 5. As shown in annex I, column 2, the total resources made available to UNIFIL for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $125,722,800 gross ($122,714,600 net). Expenditures recorded during the period (column 5) amount to $126,744,400 gross ($123,504,400 net). These include costs directly attributable to the incident at Qana as well as for the relocation of the Fiji battalion headquarters ($639,356) and the UNIFIL share towards the financing of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ($436,300). 6. Expenditures totalling $2,995,200 for the period ending 30 June 1996 were recorded in the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997. Details are contained in table 1. 7. The reported expenditures during the period under review, excluding costs related to the Qana incident, were higher than their estimated costs and resulted in additional requirements mainly as a result of the upward revision in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective 1 March 1997, an increase in the price of fuel, the share of UNIFIL towards the financing of the United Nations Logistics Base and the recording of certain expenditures pertaining to the prior financial period ending 30 June 1996. Table 1 Expenditures for the period ending 30 June 1996 Description Amount (United States dollars) Military personnel costs Contingent-owned equipment Transport operations Purchase of vehicles Spare parts Vehicle insurance Communications Communications equipment Other equipment Spare parts, repairs and maintenance Total 8. Reported expenditures during the period were less than their estimated costs and resulted in unutilized balances under military personnel costs, supplies and services, and air and surface freight. The unutilized balances were due mainly to more favourable rates obtained for both commercial and government aircraft for troop rotations, the transfer of supplies from other missions and global requisitioning of freight charges for the transfer of items from other missions. 9. The additional requirements of $3,179,400 , exclusive of Qana, were offset in part by unutilized resources of $2,797,200, resulting in actual additional requirements of $382,200 (gross). 10. In paragraph 7 of its resolution 51/233, the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for UNIFIL in the amount of $1,773,618 to cover the costs resulting from the incident at the Fiji battalion headquarters at Qana on 18 April 1996. In paragraph 8 of the resolution, the Assembly decided that the total amount of $1,773,618 should be borne by Israel. To date, no payment has been received. 11. Of the commitment authorization of $1,773,618, actual ($1,030,640) and estimated ($131,153) expenditures as at 5 February 1998 amount to $1,161,793, leaving an unencumbered balance of $611,825. As indicated in annex II.B, the portion of expenditures incurred in connection with the incident at Qana in April 1996 and charged to the UNIFIL account during the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $639,356 and included maintenance supplies ($185,985), construction/prefab buildings ($365,663), communications equipment ($43,635), spare parts and supplies for communications equipment ($40,663) and medical treatment and services ($3,410). Details of the expenditures, by period, is shown in table 2. Table 2 Expenditures associated with damages resulting from the incident at Qana on 18 April 1996 Financial period Expenditures directly attributable to the incident of 18 April 1996 Expenditures related to the relocation of the Fiji battalion headquarters Total expenditures 1 February – 30 June 1996 1 July 1996 – 30 June 1997 Subtotal 1 July 1997 – 30 June 1998 (Estimated) 12. The action to be taken by the General Assembly at its resumed fifty-second session in connection with the financing of UNIFIL includes an additional appropriation and assessment of $382,244 gross ($199,244 net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, exclusive of the amount of $639,356 for costs in connection with damages resulting from the incident at the Fiji battalion headquarters at Qana on 18 April 1996.

Standard troop cost reimbursement. The amount allocated has been fully obligated during the period. 3. Welfare. The unutilized balance of $121,300 resulted from the transfer of items such as trophies and medals from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPF). 4. Rations. Actual costs were lower than estimated, resulting in unutilized resources of $1,193,000. A comparison of the budgeted amount and actual costs is shown in table 1. Costs comparison for rations Cost estimates Actual cost Variances SSI/Fra*zer Dog rations Composite rations Local purchase 5. Daily allowance. The average troop strength of 4,509 during the period was slightly lower in comparison with the budgeted strength of 4, 513, resulting in unutilized resources of $13,000. 6. Travel and subsistence allowance. The unutilized balance of $20,000 was due to the reduction in the number of military police assigned to Netanya, from five to three in May 1996 and the lower number of UNIFIL personnel travelling in the Tel Aviv/Netanya area. 7. Emplacement, rotation and repatriation of troops. Of the apportioned amount of $7,577,000, expenditures totalled $5,211,000, resulting in unutilized resources of $2,366,000. This was mainly attributable to the more favourable rates obtained for the charter of commercial and government aircraft as well as a lower than estimated number of repatriation cases for medical and compassionate reasons. Of the unutilized resources of $2,366,000, the amount of $290,900 was provided towards the financing of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, resulting in net unutilized resources of $2,075,100. 8. Clothing and equipment allowance. The amount allocated has been fully obligated during the period. (c) Other costs pertaining to military personnel (1 123 200) 9. Contingent-owned equipment. The additional requirement of $1,123,200 was due to a number of obligations pertaining to the mandate period ending 30 June 1996 that were inadvertently recorded in the fiscal year 1996/97. 10. Death and disability compensation. The amount allocated has been fully obligated to cover potential claims. No related claim has been received to date. (a) Civilian police — 11. No provision was made under this heading. (b) International and local staff (1 430 000) 12. International staff salaries. As shown in annex III, the average vacancy rate during the period was 14 per cent, resulting in unutilized resources of $981,400. 13. Local staff salaries. Additional requirements under local staff salaries were mainly attributable to: (a) the increase in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective 1 March 1997; and (b) the payment of a non-pensionable bonus, equivalent to 5.56 months’ salary, based on the previous salary scale applicable to Naqoura, Lebanon. The authorized number of established local staff posts was 193. There was an average of 20 vacant posts during the period. The vacant posts were utilized to hire 20 local staff on special service agreement at an average rate of $920 per person per month. The breakdown of expenditures is shown in table 2. Expenditures incurred for local staff salaries 1. Apportionment 2. Expenditures Salaries, July 1996-March 1997 Retroactive salary, March 1997 Salaries, April-June 1997 Non-pensionable, 5.56-month bonus Less: Staff assessment 3. Additional requirements (1 less 2) 14. Overtime. The unutilized amount of $61,800 was due to the implementation of a policy to provide compensatory time off to local staff in lieu of overtime payment. Authorization for overtime payment was granted only under exceptional circumstances. 15. General temporary assistance. The authorized number of local staff under general temporary assistance was 151. Under this category, there was an average of 133 local staff on board during the period, resulting in an average vacancy of 18. During the period, an average of 109 local staff were hired under special service agreement at an average rate of $920 per person per month. The breakdown of expenditures is shown in table 3. Table 3 Expenditures incurred for general temporary assistance Bonus, 5.56-month Special service agreement salaries 16. Common staff costs. The additional requirement of $56,100 resulted from the increase in local staff salaries, as indicated in paragraph 13 above. 17. Other travel costs. The unutilized balance of $44,600 was due to the limitation of travel to the most essential requirements. 3. Premises/accommodation (536 700) 18. Rental of premises. The unutilized balance of $4,500 was mainly due to lower than estimated costs for the rental of premises, as shown in table 4. Table 4 Rental costs Location Budget (A/50/543/Add.1) expenditure UNIFIL House, Beirut Military Police, Natanya Recreation House, Nahariya 19. Maintenance supplies. Additional requirements were attributable to the repair of extensive damages throughout the UNIFIL area of operations resulting from the incident at Qana in April 1996. Major activities included, but were not limited to, the repair of damage to existing buildings and alterations to the boundaries of the current camp at Fiji battalion position 1-20 at Qana; preparation of the electrical distribution system at the site for a new Fiji battalion headquarters, which will be reallocated as a result of the incident, which highlighted the fact that it is no longer operationally acceptable to have a battalion headquarters in a location encompassed by a growing town; repair of damage to buildings and electrical distribution system at Nepal battalion position 5-18; and placement of bulletproof glass into observation posts and completion of miscellaneous repairs to a number of other locations in the Fiji battalion and Nepal battalion areas. Supplies totalling $185,985 were procured as follows: corrugated iron sheets ($20,850), plexiglass windows ($4,055), aluminum sliding windows ($9,450), aluminum corrugated sheets ($4,150), bulletproof glass ($46,896), fence pickets ($7,274), electrical cables ($39,985) and electrical materials ($53,325). The additional requirements detailed above were reduced by unutilized resources of $5,385 since actual costs of miscellaneous supplies were lower than estimated. The resulting additional requirements therefore amounted to $180,600. 20. Maintenance services. Actual costs were slightly lower than estimated, resulting in an unutilized balance of $5,200. 21. Utilities. Actual costs were slightly lower than estimated, resulting in an unutilized balance of $6,000. 22. Construction/prefabricated buildings. Additional requirements of $371,800 resulted mainly from operational decisions taken after the incident at Qana. It was decided that the Fiji battalion headquarters would be relocated from Qana to a new site, which involved the following construction works for the new headquarters: double-storey 21-room dormitory with shelter in the basement, an observation room on the roof and ablution facilities on each floor ($79,425), a single-storey 23-room dormitory with shelter/operations room in the basement and ablution facility ($66,485), a single-storey 12-room dormitory with ablution facility ($29,834), a double-storey 25-room dormitory with shelter in the basement and ablution facilities on each floor ($82,373) and asphalting of the new headquarters and the road leading to the new headquarters ($47,690), for a total of $305,807. There was also an operational decision to relocate Fiji battalion position 1-16A, which involved the following construction works: a dormitory, including kitchen/dining facility ($21,848), an ablution unit ($3,802), a shelter ($9,473) and electrical cables and fittings for new buildings ($11,004), for a total of $46,127. During the incident, it became obvious that under shelling United Nations troops were unable to conduct continuous observation because of the inadequate protection afforded by current observation posts. A concrete shelter/operations room was therefore constructed at Nepal battalion position 5-11AB ($19,856). Of the recorded expenditures of $990,800, an amount of $365,663 was incurred in connection with the incident at Qana, while the balance of $625,137 was incurred for budgeted construction projects and prefabricated units. 4. Infrastructure repairs — 23. No provision was made under this heading. 5. Transport operations (454 000) 24. Purchase of vehicles. Of the apportioned amount of $2,116,000, expenditures totalled $708,800, resulting in unutilized resources of $1,407,200. This was due to the transfer of 56 vehicles from other missions, as shown in table 5. However, the unutilized balance was offset in part by an amount of $145,400 provided for the financing of the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi and by recorded expenditures of $847,000 relating to the prior period ending 30 June 1996, resulting in a net unutilized balance of $414,800. Table 5 Vehicles received from other missions Model Quantity Bulldozer Loader, BackHoe Loader, front-end TFM RG-31 Nyala APC Toyota Crown saloon Toyota Hi-Ace, minibus Toyota Hi-Lux, ambulance 4x4 Toyota station wagon, HZJ80 Truck Truck, cargo Truck, recovery Truck, water, 4x4 Vibrator roller 25. Workshop equipment. The unutilized balance of $46,700 resulted from actual costs being lower than estimated. 26. Spare parts, repairs and maintenance. The additional requirement of $206,500 was due to a number of obligations pertaining to the mandate period ending 30 June 1996, which were recorded in the fiscal year 1996/97. 27. Petrol oil and lubricants. Additional requirements of $329,469 were due to the drastic increase in the price of fuel during the financial period. The breakdown of the budget and actual costs is shown in table 6. Table 6 Estimated fuel requirements Commodity Cost estimate Petrol, Benzine 96 Diesel, general Diesel, vehicles Lubricants Kerosene Fuel (Lebanon) In addition, disbursements in the amount of $35,338 relating to the prior financial period ending 30 June 1996 were recorded under the 1996/97 financial period. 28. Vehicle insurance. The additional requirement of $344,200 was due in part to an unexpected increase in worldwide third-party liability coverage for vehicles. A provision of $229,000 was made for insurance, but the actual cost was $403,700, resulting in additional requirements of $174,700. In addition, expenditures in the amount of $169,500 from the prior financial period ending 30 June 1996 were recorded in the 1996/97 financial period, resulting in total additional requirements of $344,200. Helicopter operations (166 200) 29. Hire/charter costs. The additional requirement of $171,400 was mainly due to the transfer of funds to the reserve account for third-party liability insurance of helicopters. 30. Aviation fuel and lubricants. Actual cost was slightly lower than estimated, resulting in an unutilized balance of $1,900. 31. Liability and war-risk insurance. Provision was made for liability and war-risk insurance for four helicopters at a rate of $2,000 per helicopter per annum. The actual premium for the period from 1 May 1996 to 29 January 1997 amounted to $9,200. Expenditures recorded during the reporting period amounted to $4,700, resulting in an unutilized balance of $3,300. 7. Naval operations — 32. No provision was made under this heading. (a) Complementary communications (297 800) 33. Communications equipment. Of the apportioned amount of $410,000, actual expenditures incurred totalled $713,400, resulting in additional requirements of $303,400. The move of the Fiji battalion headquarters to a new location necessitated the duplication of the equipment currently located at position 1-20. Position 1-20 provides communication links from Alyatun to the Fiji battalion and then by repeater to the Force Mobile Reserve. Rural links are also used to Fiji battalion positions 1-6 and 1-23. These links cannot be dismantled while new links are being installed, hence the need for duplicates. The following items in the total amount of $277,655, for which budgetary provision had not been made, were purchased for the above purpose: a Coral II telephone exchange ($22,770), one digital phone link ($10,231), five GM-300 radios ($1,840), one Canon fax, B340 ($1,044), one multiplex interface ($7,750), 159 intercom systems ($18,168), 53 power and RF amplifiers ($41,138), 204 cable assemblies ($9,064) and 182 crewman helmets ($53,326), fax switch ($77,984), 20 portable radios ($7,600), 40 mobile radios ($15,900) and five repeaters ($10,840). In addition, intercom systems were also purchased for armoured personnel carriers ($2,745) and expenditure in the amount of $23,000 pertaining to the period ending 30 June 1996 was recorded during the period under review. Of the total expenditures of $713,400 reported, the amount of $43,635 relates directly to the relocation of the Fiji battalion headquarters. 34. Spare parts and supplies. The apportioned amount was $335,000. Total expenditures amounted to $350,100, of which $309,437 was incurred for the purchase of communications spare parts and repairs, resulting in an unutilized amount of $25,563. This was offset by expenditures of $40,663 associated with the relocation of the Fiji battalion headquarters, resulting in additional requirements of $15,100. 35. Workshop and test equipment. Actual costs were higher than estimated, resulting in additional requirements of $800. 36. Commercial communications. Lower usage of telex services as a result of improvements in other commercial services, such as faxes and electronic mail, resulted in unutilized resources of $21,500. (b) Main trunking contract — 37. No provision was made under this heading. 9. Other equipment (296 400) 38. Office furniture. The unutilized balance of $19,000 was attributable to the transfer of office furniture from the United Nations Logistic Base at Brindisi. 39. Office equipment. The unanticipated replacement of the following worn-out office equipment resulted in additional requirements of $2,700: two facsimile machines ($970) and two time-stamp machines ($1,730). 40. Data-processing equipment. Additional requirements of $240,200 resulted from the need to replace worn-out equipment, to finalize linking the extremities of Naqoura Camp to the UNIFIL local area network, to upgrade personal computers and to purchase additional personal computers to implement a new Department of Peacekeeping Operations-wide field asset control system utilizing Lotus Notes. Additional expenditures were as follows: 34 serial mouse for personal computers ($414), one flatbed colour scanner ($1,140), one cable scanner tool ($4,950), 40 SMART UPS ($12,400), Network hardware - 24 transceivers ($2,880), two Cabletron SPIM-A repeaters ($255), four Cabletron MPIM-C repeaters ($3,371), two Cabletron MINIMAC repeaters ($1,705), 80 memory SIMMS for Pentium 60 MHZ personal computers ($1,600), 53 personal computers with 14-inch monitors for Windows ($79,468), 48 personal computers with 15-inch monitors for FACS ($75,216), two file servers for Lotus Notes ($52,900) and Data Link 3.0/3.5 ($3,882). 41. Observation equipment. Additional requirements of $66,600 were due to the replacement of 39 Lunos 4x4 binoculars ($48,400) and 25 searchlights ($18,200) for which budgetary provision had not been made. 42. Medical and dental equipment. Actual costs were lower than estimated, resulting in an unutilized balance of $2,200. 43. Accommodation equipment. The unutilized balance of $15,700 was due to the transfer of accommodation equipment from UNPF to UNIFIL. 44. Miscellaneous equipment. Additional requirements of $3,900 were due to the need to purchase specialized hand tools for the Warm and Cold Workshop in Naqoura in order to carry out efficient repairs to different types of kitchen, heating and cooling equipment ($3,575) and engineering tools ($325). 45. Spare parts, repairs and maintenance. Additional requirements of $19,900 resulted from the purchase of four flow meters for fuel trucks in order to have better control of fuel distribution ($3,200) and the recording of expenditures relating to the prior financial period ending 30 June 1996 ($16,700). (a) Miscellaneous services 5 700 46. Audit services. The provision has been fully obligated in order to cover the cost of the external audit conducted during the reporting period. 47. Contractual services. Actual costs for contractual services were lower than estimated, resulting in unutilized resources for garbage collection ($25,600) and for emptying of cesspit tanks ($62,000). The bidding process provided for more bidders, which resulted in lower prices for those services. 48. Security services. The additional requirement of $2,476 resulted from the fact that the cost of security services at Rosh Hanigra, Beirut, increased in June 1996 from $770 to $885.50 per month. This additional requirement was offset in part by an unutilized balance of $543 for the security service at Rosh Hanigra. 49. Medical treatment and services. Additional requirements of $50,800 resulted from medical examinations and hospitalization provided away from the UNIFIL hospital. Treatments provided by other hospitals are as follows: gunshot wound ($4,890), continuation of treatment from the incident at Qana for three Fijian soldiers ($3,410) and two soldiers with kidney dysfunction requiring dialysis ($42,500). 50. Miscellaneous other services. Additional requirements of $29,200 were due to claims for guard dog services relating to previous financial periods that were presented for payment during the period under review. (b) Miscellaneous supplies 506 700 51. Stationery and office supplies. Actual costs were lower than estimated, resulting in an unutilized balance of $1,500. 52. Medical supplies. The unutilized balance of $75,500 was due to the transfer of supplies from other missions and donations from the Government of Germany and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Medical supplies received during the period under review were as follows: 112 medical items valued at $48,800 from the Government of Germany, medicines and surgical materials from UNICEF ($13,500) and 14 medical items valued at $13,200 from UNPF. 53. Sanitation and cleaning materials. The standard ratio for sanitation and cleaning materials had been set at $5 per person per month for all personnel. For UNIFIL, this equates to $299,520. However, the estimates were based on expenditure patterns during previous periods. Additional expenditures of $38,600 were incurred owing to the fact that additional sanitation and cleaning materials were required to maintain a minimum level of hygiene and cleanliness in order to prevent epidemiological hazards that could become a health problem for the troops. 54. Uniform items, flags and decals. The unutilized balance of $254,400 was due to non-purchase of winter clothing ($132,800), the transfer of flak jackets from the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi ($60,800), items transferred from UNPF ($10,000) and sufficient stock from the previous mandate ($50,800). 55. Field defence stores. An unutilized balance of $159,200 was realized owing to the transfer of items from UNPF ($127,800) and actual cost being lower than estimated ($31,400). 56. Quartermaster and general stores. An unutilized balance of $54,600 was realized owing to the transfer of items from other missions and the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi. 11.
