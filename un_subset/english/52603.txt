General Assembly Sixty-fourth session Agenda item 10 Report of the Peacebuilding Commission Security Council Sixty-fifth year * Reissued for technical reasons on 23 July 2010. Letter dated 19 July 2010 from the President of the Security Council addressed to the Chairperson of the Peacebuilding Commission I have the honour to refer you to paragraph 12 of Security Council resolution 1645 (2005). In a letter dated 27 May 2010 addressed to the Secretary-General that was forwarded to the Security Council on 14 June 2010, the Permanent Representative of Liberia to the United Nations requested that Liberia be placed on the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission. The Security Council supports that request and invites the Peacebuilding Commission to provide advice on the situation in Liberia. The Security Council would welcome, first and foremost, the Peacebuilding Commission's advice and recommendations, following close consultation with the Government of Liberia, on the requirements necessary to help accelerate progress in meeting key benchmarks, such as those set out by the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), in the following areas: :: Strengthening rule of law; :: Supporting security sector reform; :: Supporting national reconciliation. The Security Council views Liberia's request as an important step on the country's, and indeed the region's, path to stability and lasting peace. We encourage the Peacebuilding Commission to consider where it might add value in the near term to critical peacebuilding concerns in Liberia. (Signed) U. Joy Ogwu President of the Security Council
