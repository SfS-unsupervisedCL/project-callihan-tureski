Letter dated 12 June 2000 from the Permanent Representative of Portugal to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General I have the honour to bring to your attention the statement on the situation in Kisangani issued on 9 June 2000 by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union (see annex). I should be grateful if you would have the text of this letter and its annex distributed as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Ant√≥nio Monteiro Permanent Representative of Portugal to the United Nations [Original: English and French] Statement on the situation in Kisangani issued on 9 June 2000 by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union The European Union expresses its utmost concern at the renewed fighting between Rwandan and Ugandan forces in Kisangani, which has resulted in the deaths of civilians and damage to property and has put the safety of the population and United Nations personnel at unacceptable risk. Those military actions occurring in the territory of a third country are quite intolerable and are incompatible with the Lusaka Agreement, the Kampala Disengagement Plan of 8 April and other bilateral commitments made by the belligerents. The European Union strongly urges Rwanda and Uganda to cease hostilities without delay, to take immediate steps to implement the ceasefire and the demilitarization plan previously agreed by them, and to withdraw from Kisangani. The Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union, the associated countries Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, and the European Free Trade Association countries members of the European Economic Area align themselves with this statement.
