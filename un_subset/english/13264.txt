Letter dated 1 August 2000 from the Permanent Representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council * The above-mentioned publications may be consulted at the Secretariat. United Nations and Specialized Agencies Collection, Room L-201. On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit herewith the following documents:* 1. Guidelines for the demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; 2. Programme to prepare for the demobilization and reintegration of vulnerable groups, known as the "Plan of Action 2000 DR-GV". These documents reflect my Government's reaction to the request which the Security Council addressed to States, in its resolution 1261 (1999) of 25 August 1999, to intensify their efforts to ensure an end to the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. The first document describes the various stages of the actual implementation of the process of demobilization and familial reintegration of minors and of vulnerable groups, both men and women, who are present in the Congolese armed forces or in any other public or private armed group anywhere in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The second document covers the initial stages of the implementation of the process of demobilization and reintegration of the most vulnerable former combatants, especially the children. I should be grateful if you would have the text of this letter and its annexes circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Andr√© M. Kapanga Ambassador Permanent Representative
