Fifty-eighth session Agenda item 32 Question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) Letter dated 13 January 2004 from the Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General In accordance with instructions received from my Government, I have the honour to refer to the letter dated 5 January 2004 from the Permanent Representative of Argentina to the United Nations addressed to you (A/58/671), transmitting in the annex thereto the text of a press release issued on 3 January 2004 by the Government of Argentina on the question of the Falkland Islands. The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has no doubt about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands and rejects as unfounded the claim by the Government of Argentina to sovereignty over those islands and the surrounding maritime areas and that the Falkland Islands are under illegal occupation by the United Kingdom. I should be grateful if you would arrange for the text of the present letter to be circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda item 32. (Signed) Emyr Jones Parry
