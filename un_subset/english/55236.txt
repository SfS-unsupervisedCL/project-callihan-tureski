Pursuant to article 4, paragraph 1, of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which states that States parties shall carry out their obligations under the Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States, the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime establishes the following mechanism to review implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto. I. Introduction 2. The mechanism for the review of implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (hereinafter "the mechanism") includes a review process that shall be guided by the principles contained in sections II and III and be carried out in accordance with the provisions contained in section IV. The mechanism shall be supported by a secretariat as set out in sections V and VI and be financed in accordance with section VII. II. Guiding principles and characteristics of the mechanism 3. The mechanism shall: (g) Base its work on clear, established guidelines for the compilation, production and dissemination of information, including addressing issues of confidentiality and the submission of the outcome to the Conference, which is the competent body to take action on such an outcome; (h) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, difficulties encountered by States parties in the fulfilment of their obligations under the Convention and its Protocols, as applicable, and good practices adopted in efforts by States parties to implement the Convention and, where applicable, the Protocols thereto; (j) Complement existing relevant international and regional review mechanisms in order that the Conference may, as appropriate, cooperate with those mechanisms and avoid duplication of effort. 4. The mechanism shall be an intergovernmental process. 5. In conformity with article 4 of the Convention, the mechanism shall not serve as an instrument for interfering in the domestic affairs of States parties but shall respect the principles of equality and sovereignty of States parties, and the review process shall be conducted in a non-political and non-selective manner. 6. The mechanism shall promote the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols by States parties, as applicable, as well as cooperation among States parties. 7. The mechanism shall provide opportunities to exchange views, ideas and good practices, thus contributing to strengthening cooperation among States parties in preventing and fighting transnational organized crime. 8. The mechanism shall take into account the levels of development of States parties, as well as the diversity of judicial, legal, political, economic and social systems and differences in legal traditions. 9. The review of implementation of the Convention is an ongoing and gradual process. Consequently, the mechanism shall endeavour to adopt a progressive and comprehensive approach. III. Relationship of the mechanism with the Conference of the Parties 10. The review of implementation of the Convention and the mechanism shall be under the authority of the Conference, in accordance with article 32 of the Convention. IV. Review process A. Goals 11. Consistent with the Convention, in particular article 32, the purpose of the review process shall be to assist States parties in their implementation of the Convention and its Protocols, as applicable. In this regard, the review process, inter alia, shall: (a) Promote the purposes of the Convention as set out in its article 1; (b) Promote the statements of purpose of the Protocols to the Convention, as set out in article 2 of each of the Protocols; (c) Provide the Conference with information on the measures taken by States parties in implementing the Convention and, where applicable, the Protocols thereto, as well as the difficulties encountered by them in doing so; (d) Help States parties to identify and substantiate specific needs for technical assistance and to promote and facilitate the provision of technical assistance; (e) Promote and facilitate international cooperation in the prevention of and the fight against transnational organized crime; (f) Provide the Conference with information on successes, good practices and challenges of States parties in implementing and using the Convention and its Protocols; (g) Provide the Conference with information on implementation trends and emerging issues, including regional successes, challenges and technical assistance needs (see sect. IV.C below); (h) Promote and facilitate the exchange of information, practices and experiences gained in the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. B. Country review 12. The mechanism shall be applicable to all States parties. It shall gradually cover the implementation of the entire Convention and its Protocols. 13. The review of all States that are parties to the Convention at the start of a review cycle should be completed before a new review cycle begins. In exceptional cases, however, the Conference may decide to launch a new review cycle before the completion of all reviews of the previous cycle. No State party shall undergo a review twice in the same review cycle, without prejudice to the right of a State party to provide new information. In the review cycle, review of a State party's implementation should include that State's implementation of the Convention and all the Protocols thereto to which it is a party. In order to organize the reviews, the review cycles should cover applicable thematic areas of the Convention and its Protocols. 14. The number of States parties from each regional group participating in the review process in a given year shall be proportionate to the size of that regional group and the number of its members that are States parties to the Convention. The selection of States parties participating in the review process in a given year of a review cycle shall be carried out by the drawing of lots at the beginning of each review cycle. A State party selected for review in a given year may, with a reasonable justification, defer participation to the following year of the review cycle. 15. Each State party shall provide to the secretariat the information required by the Conference on its compliance with and implementation of the Convention and its Protocols, as applicable, using the comprehensive self-assessment checklist as an initial step for that purpose. States parties shall provide complete, up-to-date, accurate and timely responses. 16. Assistance in the preparation of the responses to the checklist shall be provided by the secretariat to States parties requesting such assistance. 17. Each State party shall appoint a focal point to coordinate its participation in the review. Each State party shall endeavour to appoint, as a focal point, a person or persons with substantive expertise on the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto to which the State is party. 1. Conduct of the country review 18. Each State party to the Convention shall be reviewed by two other States parties to the Convention. The review process shall actively involve the State party under review. 18 bis. Regarding the review of the Protocols to the Convention, the reviewing States parties must be parties to the Protocols to which the State under review is a party. However, reviewing States parties may be parties to more Protocols to the Convention than is the State under review. 19. One of the two reviewing States parties shall be from the same geographical region as the State party under review and shall, if possible, be a State with a legal system similar to that of the State party under review. The selection of the reviewing States parties shall be carried out by the drawing of lots at the beginning of each year of the cycle, with the understanding that States parties shall not undertake mutual reviews. The State party under review may request, a maximum of two times, that the drawing of lots be repeated. In exceptional circumstances, the drawing of lots may be repeated more than twice. 20. A State party under review may defer serving as a reviewing State party that same year. That same principle, mutatis mutandis, shall apply to the reviewing States parties. By the end of a review cycle, each State party must have undergone its own review and performed a minimum of one review and a maximum of three reviews. 21. Each State party shall appoint up to 20 governmental experts for the purpose of the review process. Such experts should have expertise in relevant areas to be covered in the review cycle, including on issues corresponding to the Protocols to which that State is a party. The secretariat shall, prior to the drawing of lots to select the reviewing States parties, compile and circulate a list of such governmental experts, which shall include information on their professional background, their current positions, relevant offices held and activities carried out and their areas of expertise as required for the respective review cycle. States parties shall endeavour to provide information necessary for the secretariat to compile that list and keep it up to date. 22. The reviewing States parties shall carry out, in accordance with the guidelines for governmental experts and the secretariat in the conduct of country reviews (hereinafter "the guidelines"), a desk review of the response to the comprehensive self-assessment checklist by the State party under review. Such desk review shall entail an analysis of the response focused on measures taken to implement the Convention and on successes in and challenges of such implementation. 23. In accordance with the guiding principles set out in section II and in conformity with the guidelines, the reviewing States parties, supported by the secretariat, may request the State party under review to provide clarifications or additional information or to address supplementary questions related to the review. The ensuing constructive dialogue may be carried out, inter alia, by way of conference calls, videoconferences or e-mail exchanges, as appropriate. 24. The schedule and requirements of each country review shall be established by the secretariat in consultation with the reviewing States parties and the State party under review and shall address all issues relevant to the review. The reviews should ideally be designed to take no longer than six months. 25. The country review shall lead to the elaboration of a country review report based on the blueprint contained in appendix II to the present terms of reference. 26. The country review shall be carried out as follows: (a) The desk review shall be based on the responses to the comprehensive self-assessment checklist and any supplementary information provided by the State party under review; (b) In the context of the constructive dialogue between the governmental experts, the State party under review shall facilitate the exchange of information relevant to the implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto to which the State party under review is a party; (c) If the State party under review is a member of a competent international or regional organization whose mandate covers issues relevant to the review, the reviewing States parties may consider information relevant to the implementation of the Convention produced by that organization. 27. The State party under review shall endeavour to prepare its responses to the comprehensive self-assessment checklist through broad consultations at the national level with all relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, individuals and groups outside the public sector. The State party under review shall, where applicable, specify in its responses to the checklist the stakeholders that were included in the consultations and the relevance of those stakeholders, bearing in mind the specific provisions of the Protocols on the role of such stakeholders. 28. If agreed by the State party under review, the desk review should be complemented by any further means of direct dialogue, such as a country visit or a joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, in accordance with the guidelines. 29. States parties are encouraged to facilitate engagement with all relevant national stakeholders in the course of a country visit. Prior to the organization of a country visit, the State party under review shall propose to the reviewing States parties the stakeholders to be included in the visit and specify the relevance of those stakeholders to the subject matter of the review, bearing in mind the specific provisions of the Protocols on the role of such stakeholders. 30. The reviewing States parties and the secretariat shall maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of, or used in, the country review process. 31. The secretariat shall organize periodic training courses for experts who participate in the review process, in order to familiarize them with the guidelines and increase their capacity to participate in the review process. 2. Outcome of the country review process 32. The reviewing States parties shall, in accordance with the guidelines and the blueprint, prepare a country review report, including an executive summary of the report, in close cooperation and coordination with the State party under review and assisted by the secretariat. The report shall identify successes, good practices and challenges and make observations for the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. Where appropriate, the report shall include the identification of technical assistance needs for the purpose of improving implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. 33. The country review report, including the executive summary, shall be finalized upon agreement between the reviewing States parties and the State party under review. 34. The secretariat shall compile the most common and relevant information on successes, good practices, challenges, observations and technical assistance needs contained in the country review reports and include them, organized by theme, in a thematic implementation report and regional supplementary addenda, for submission to the open-ended group of experts and the Implementation Oversight Group. 35. The executive summaries of all finalized country review reports shall be translated into the six official languages of the United Nations and be made available as documents of the Implementation Oversight Group for information purposes only. 36. The country review reports shall remain confidential. However, the State party under review is encouraged to exercise its sovereign right to publish its country review report or part thereof. 37. In order to improve and strengthen cooperation and learning among States parties, States parties shall, upon request, endeavour to make country review reports accessible to any other State party. Where appropriate, the requesting State party shall fully respect the confidentiality of such reports. C. Expert analysis 37 bis. The country review process shall be complemented by a parallel expert analysis carried out by an open-ended group of experts that will strive to identify general implementation trends and relevant emerging issues, including regional successes, challenges and technical assistance needs. 37 ter. The open-ended group of experts shall be composed of those experts nominated by States parties and be included in the list referred to in paragraph 21 of the present terms of reference. The group of experts shall meet in Vienna once a year. 37 quarter. The expert analysis shall have the same thematic scope as the corresponding review cycle. The group of experts shall base its work on the executive summaries of the country review reports and on the compilation made by the secretariat of the most common and relevant information on successes, good practices, challenges, observations and technical assistance needs, as referred to in paragraph 34 of the present terms of reference. The executive summaries shall be made available for information purposes only. 37 quinquies. In addition, the open-ended group of experts may consider other relevant information or the views of other stakeholders only as may be relevant for the assessment of general trends and emerging issues related to the Protocols to the Convention. In no case shall the expert analysis embark upon a country-specific assessment of implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. 37 sexies. The open-ended group of experts shall produce a technical expert group report on the issues relevant to its mandate in each year of the cycle. The report may include appropriate recommendations for dealing with emerging issues and challenges of implementation, with specific attention to regional and technical assistance needs. 37 septies.

On the basis of its deliberations, the Implementation Oversight Group shall submit recommendations and conclusions to the Conference for its consideration and approval. E. Follow-up procedures 41. In the following review phase, each State party shall submit information in its responses to the comprehensive self-assessment checklist on progress achieved in connection with the observations contained in its previous country review reports. As appropriate, States parties shall also provide information on whether technical assistance needs requested by them in relation to their country review reports have been provided. 42. The Conference, through the Implementation Oversight Group, shall assess and adapt, where appropriate, the procedures and requirements for the follow-up to the conclusions and observations emerging from the review process, including follow-up to the recommendations on technical assistance. For such purposes, the Conference may decide to convene, at each regular session, working groups on the Convention and its Protocols. F. Conference of the Parties 43.

The costs associated with such participation shall be paid from available voluntary contributions. I. General guidance 1. Throughout the review process, governmental experts and the secretariat shall be guided by the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the terms of reference of the mechanism for the review of implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 2. In particular, governmental experts shall bear in mind article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention, which states that States parties shall carry out their obligations under the Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. 3. Furthermore, governmental experts shall carry out the reviews in full recognition of the purpose of the review process as specified in paragraph 11 of the terms of reference. 4. During all interactions within the review process, governmental experts shall respect the collective approach. Governmental experts are expected to act with courtesy and diplomacy, and shall remain objective and impartial. Governmental experts need to be flexible in their approach and ready to adapt to changes in schedules. 5. Governmental experts and the secretariat shall maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of, or used in, the country review process, as well as the country review report, as stipulated in the terms of reference. If there are serious grounds for believing that a governmental expert or a member of the secretariat has violated the obligation of confidentiality, the States parties concerned or the secretariat may inform the Implementation Oversight Group for appropriate consideration and action, including referring the matter to the Conference. 6. It is also expected that governmental experts are not to be influenced in their assessment of the implementation of the Convention. While information generated through competent regional and international organizations of which the State party under review is a member and whose mandates cover issues relevant to the review of the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols is to be taken into account, governmental experts shall make their own analysis of the facts provided by the State party under review in order to present findings that are in line with all the specific requirements of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto under review. 7. Throughout the review process, governmental experts are encouraged to contact the secretariat for any assistance required. II. Specific guidance for the conduct of the review 8. In accordance with the terms of reference and consistent with the importance of ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the review process, reviews shall be conducted in a spirit of constructive collaboration, dialogue and mutual trust. 9. States parties and the secretariat shall endeavour to adhere to the indicative timelines set out in the paragraphs below. 10. The governmental experts shall prepare themselves by: (a) Studying thoroughly the Convention and the terms of reference of the mechanism, including the present guidelines; (b) Familiarizing themselves with the Legislative Guide for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime as well as the Travaux Préparatoires of the Negotiations for the Elaboration of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, particularly those parts pertaining to the articles that are the subject of the relevant review cycle; (c) Reviewing the responses provided by the State party under review in its comprehensive self-assessment checklist and supplementary documentation and familiarizing themselves with the issues addressed by the State party under review; (d) Informing the secretariat if additional information and material are required and highlighting issues requiring further clarification. 11. The Secretariat shall organize periodic training courses for governmental experts who participate in the review process, so that they can familiarize themselves with the guidelines and increase their capacity to participate in the review process. 12. The secretariat, within one month after the drawing of lots, shall officially inform the State party under review and the reviewing States parties of the date of the beginning of the conduct of the country review, as well as of all relevant procedural matters, including the schedule for the training of experts and a provisional schedule for the country review. 13. The State party under review, within three weeks after being officially informed, shall appoint a focal point to coordinate its participation in the review, in accordance with paragraph 17 of the terms of reference, and inform the secretariat of that focal point. The secretariat shall assign a staff member to each review. 14. The secretariat shall undertake consultations with the State party under review and the reviewing States parties on the establishment of schedules and requirements of the country review, including the selection of working language or languages of the country review, in accordance with section VI of the terms of reference. The translation to and from those languages shall be provided by the secretariat within the whole review process. 15. The State party under review shall, within two months of being officially informed of the beginning of the conduct of the country review, provide to the secretariat the information required on its compliance with and implementation of the Convention, using the comprehensive self-assessment checklist as an initial step for that purpose. Assistance in the preparation of the responses shall be provided by the secretariat to the State party requesting such assistance. The secretariat shall, within one month of the receipt of the checklist response, submit that response for translation and circulate it to the governmental experts. 16. Within one month after the State party under review has been officially informed about the beginning of the conduct of the country review, governmental experts shall participate in a telephone conference or videoconference, to be organized by the secretariat for the purpose of an initial introduction of the reviewing States parties, the State party under review and the staff member of the secretariat assigned to the country review, as well as for general orientation, including a review of the schedule and requirements established for the review. 17. Governmental experts from reviewing States parties shall take a decision on how to divide tasks and issues among themselves, taking into account their respective fields of competence. 18. While governmental experts shall establish open lines of communication with the State party under review, the experts shall keep the secretariat abreast of all these communications. 19. Throughout the process, the governmental experts shall appropriately consider the information and material provided by the State party under review through the different means of communication as described in the terms of reference. 20. When seeking additional information and asking for clarification, governmental experts shall bear in mind the non-adversarial, non-intrusive and non-punitive character of the review and the overall goal of assisting the State party under review to reach full implementation of the Convention. 21. Within one month of the receipt of the response to the comprehensive self-assessment checklist and any supplementary information provided by the State party under review, governmental experts shall submit to the secretariat the outcome of the desk review, including requests for clarifications, additional information or supplementary questions, to be translated into the designated languages of the review and provided to the State party under review. 22. During the desk review, governmental experts shall avoid duplicating texts already contained in the comprehensive self-assessment checklist. The desk review is to be concise and factual and is to include solid reasoning for the outcome of the desk review. Objective and impersonal language will aid understanding. When abbreviations and acronyms are used, these shall be defined upon their first use. 23. After the State party under review receives the outcome of the desk review, the secretariat shall organize a telephone conference or videoconference bringing together the governmental experts of the reviewing States parties and the State party under review. During the conference call, governmental experts from the reviewing States parties shall introduce their parts of the desk review and explain the findings. The ensuing dialogue shall ideally last up to two months and consist of requests for additional information or specific questions from the governmental experts, to which the State party under review shall respond, using various means of dialogue including conference calls, videoconferences, e-mail exchanges or further means of direct dialogue as mentioned in paragraph 24 of the terms of reference and as specified below. 24. If agreed by the State party under review, the desk review should be complemented by any further means of direct dialogue, such as a country visit or a joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. The country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna shall be planned and organized by the State party under review. While the secretariat will facilitate all practical arrangements, governmental experts shall take all necessary measures from their side to participate in the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, bearing in mind paragraph 29 of the terms of reference. 25. During the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, governmental experts shall uphold the principles and standards outlined in the general guidance above. 26. Governmental experts are expected to actively and constructively participate in all meetings, including at internal debriefings at the end of each working day, or at the end of the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 27. Governmental experts are expected to be respectful and courteous in meetings, respecting time frames set in the programme and allowing time for all members to participate. At the same time, governmental experts are expected to be flexible, as the programme may change during the country visit or the joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 28. Questions should seek to complement information already provided by the State party under review and relate only to the review process. Governmental experts shall therefore remain neutral and not voice personal opinions during the meetings. 29. Governmental experts are expected to take notes during all meetings, which they can refer to for the production of the final country review report. They shall share their opinions and preliminary findings in writing among themselves and with the secretariat within two weeks after the country visit or the joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 30. At the final stage of the country review process and preferably within five months of the beginning of the review, based on the blueprint format, the governmental experts shall, with the assistance of the secretariat, prepare a draft country review report and send it to the State party under review in the designated language of the review.

Also attending the session were observers for States signatories to the Convention, non-signatory States, an entity maintaining a permanent observer mission to the United Nations, Secretariat units, United Nations bodies, funds and programmes, institutes of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network, specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and relevant non-governmental organizations not having consultative status with the Economic and Social Council that had applied for observer status. In accordance with rule 17 of the rules of procedure, the Secretariat circulated a list of relevant non-governmental organizations and no objection to that list was received. The list of participants is contained in document CTOC/COP/2010/ INF/2/Rev.1. In its decisions 3/2 and 4/2, the Conference encouraged Member States to work with existing regional networks and requested the Secretariat to facilitate communication between national authorities and to strengthen networking among authorities at the interregional level. Furthermore, in Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 19/7, entitled "Strengthening of regional networks for international cooperation in criminal matters", the Commission recommended that the Conference consider inviting existing regional networks to participate in its fifth session, with the aim of improving cooperation between regional networks. The Secretariat brought this issue to the attention of the Bureau and, at its request, circulated a list of such organizations to the Conference through the regional groups. At its 5th meeting, the Conference considered whether those intergovernmental organizations that had a regional component and that were present at the Conference could also attend the meetings of the Working Group on International Cooperation. The Conference decided that such organizations would be granted permission to attend the meetings of the Working Group on International Cooperation provided that that would not serve as a precedent in the future regarding the attendance of intergovernmental organizations at meetings of working groups. At the request of the Extended Bureau of the fifth session, the Secretariat circulated a list of intergovernmental organizations including both organizations that had received a standing invitation to participate as observers in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly and intergovernmental organizations that had been invited to attend sessions of the Conference in the past. At its 10th meeting, the Conference decided that the intergovernmental organizations contained in document CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.7, as orally amended, would receive a standing invitation under rule 16, paragraph 2, of the rules of procedure, to attend future sessions of the Conference.

"4.

According to rule 19 of the rules of procedure, the Bureau shall examine the credentials of representatives of each State party and the names of the persons constituting the State party's delegation and submit its report to the Conference. At the 10th meeting of the session of the Conference, on 22 October, the Rapporteur informed the Conference that the Secretariat had distributed to the Bureau, at its third, fourth and fifth meetings, the lists of (a) those States that had complied with requirements by submitting to the Secretariat original credentials either in the form of original credentials or in the form of notes verbales signed by the permanent representative; and (b) those States that had only submitted their credentials in the form of notes verbales, with only initials and stamp, or by e-mail. The Bureau recommended that the Conference adopt the oral report of the Bureau indicating that all States parties represented at the fifth session had complied with the credential requirements, with the understanding that those States that were not in compliance would be given until 29 October 2010 to submit their original credentials to the Secretariat.

Outcome and closing of the high-level segment In her introductory address, the President of the Conference recalled that the high-level segment was being held pursuant to General Assembly resolution 64/179, in which the Assembly recommended that the Conference organize a high-level segment during its fifth session to discuss new and emerging forms of crime and ways and means of enhancing the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto. Several speakers emphasized that the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Organized Crime Convention provided an opportunity for States to renew their collective and individual commitment to the fight against transnational organized crime and to assess the effectiveness of measures taken to date. Reference was made to the special high-level meeting on transnational organized crime held by the General Assembly on 17 and 21 June 2010, which provided significant political impetus to advancing the ratification and implementation of the Organized Crime Convention and the Protocols thereto. Several speakers expressed deep concern regarding the growing and multidimensional threat of organized crime. Organized crime had become a business of macroeconomic proportions, thus hindering legitimate economic activities and undermining democratic governance, security and development. The importance of the Convention and its Protocols as the principal international instruments for combating organized crime in all its forms and manifestations was underlined. Several speakers drew attention to the large number of States parties to the Convention and the importance of promoting universal adherence and comprehensive implementation. They also highlighted that concerted efforts were required to dismantle powerful international criminal networks. Many speakers noted that globalization and interconnectivity had contributed to the expansion of transnational organized criminal groups, allowing them to gain power, adapt their modus operandi and operate beyond national borders. A number of speakers made reference to trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants as two of the most heinous manifestations of organized crime. It was also stated that trafficking in firearms facilitated organized crime, thus requiring greater cooperation and action in that regard. Furthermore, speakers emphasized that criminal groups had also expanded their activities to include cybercrime, trafficking in cultural property, piracy, trafficking in natural resources, trafficking in counterfeit medicines and trafficking in organs. In that regard, many speakers underlined the great adaptability of the Organized Crime Convention, which provided a broad definition of serious crime. The Convention therefore constituted an invaluable and effective instrument in tackling new and emerging forms of crime. Speakers underlined the importance of developing adequate legislative and operational responses in order to prevent and combat emerging and re-emerging forms of crime. It was emphasized that comprehensive crime prevention policies were necessary to address the root causes of crime. In addition, speakers highlighted the devastating effects of cybercrime as illustrated by the phenomenon of child sexual exploitation. The issue of whether a new legal instrument targeting cybercrime should be developed was raised. Several speakers noted the steady increase in trafficking in cultural property, which was a serious form of organized crime. They emphasized that cultural property was a common heritage that needed to be preserved and protected and that effective international cooperation was needed to facilitate the return of stolen property. Several speakers also expressed their growing concern with regard to piracy and trafficking in natural resources. Most speakers underscored the importance of international cooperation as a key component of the Convention. They evoked the unique and comprehensive framework provided by the Convention, which established common mechanisms for extradition and mutual legal assistance and which would deny safe havens to criminals. Similarly, the ability to effectively carry out seizures and confiscations would ensure that criminal organizations were deprived of their illicit assets and deny them undue influence. Several speakers stressed that it would be essential, 10 years after the adoption of the Convention, to develop a mechanism that would help the Conference to better monitor the implementation of the Convention and highlight good practices. It was also noted that full implementation could be achieved only through the consistent and sustainable provision of technical assistance to requesting countries. Speakers expressed their appreciation for the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and called for a more stable and predictable funding of its activities in support of implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto. IV. General discussion At its 2nd and 3rd meetings, on 18 and 19 October 2010, the Conference took up agenda item 1 (f), entitled "General discussion". The sub-item had been included in the agenda to allow time for statements to be made on matters of a general nature that were related to the implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto and that might be of interest to the Conference. Based on the experience gained at past sessions of the Conference, the extended Bureau had decided that the organization of a general discussion would offer participants an opportunity to express their views in general terms in the plenary, while allowing more focused and interactive exchanges to take place under the substantive items of the agenda. The Conference heard statements by the representatives of Algeria (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of 77 and China), Sudan (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the African Group) and Sri Lanka (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Asian Group). Statements were also made by the representatives of Austria, the United States of America, Canada, Ecuador, Liechtenstein, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Yemen, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Mongolia, the Philippines, South Africa, Switzerland, Argentina, Belarus, Morocco, China, Kenya, Guatemala, Oman, Armenia, Norway, Israel, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Costa Rica, Peru, Panama and Egypt. The Conference also heard statements by the observers for the following signatory States: Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Republic of Korea and Viet Nam. The Conference also heard a joint statement by non-governmental organizations. Speakers underlined the importance of the Organized Crime Convention and its Protocols, stressed the need for universal ratification of those instruments and recalled the importance of international cooperation and technical assistance for such implementation. Several speakers reported on achievements made by their Governments in implementing the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto, including progress made in bringing national legislation in line with the requirements of the Convention and measures taken to enhance effective coordination at the national level and cooperation with other countries in combating transnational organized crime. Several speakers noted that one country alone could not tackle the threat of transnational organized crime and highlighted that improved international cooperation was key to effectively countering such criminal activities. Speakers noted that international instruments dealing with organized crime, corruption and terrorism contained provisions on exchange of information, data collection, mutual legal assistance and extradition and that efforts should be better coordinated in order to fully implement those provisions. Speakers stressed the importance of the technical assistance provided by UNODC to requesting States in order to assist them in meeting their obligations under the Convention and its Protocols and reaffirmed that technical assistance should be delivered on the basis of needs and priorities. Some speakers also noted that the Open-ended Working Group of Government Experts on Technical Assistance was an essential component of the Conference. Most speakers emphasized that organized crime was becoming increasingly varied and interconnected, and underlined the applicability of the Organized Crime Convention and its Protocols to both traditional and new forms of transnational organized crime. Some speakers stressed the need to fulfil the potential of the Convention before exploring the creation of supplementary protocols to address emerging forms of organized crime, while other speakers highlighted the need to create new instruments to deal with new threats, particularly those posed by cybercrime and trafficking in cultural property. Many speakers welcomed the outcomes of the Twelfth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the nineteenth session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, particularly with regard to the establishment of an open-ended intergovernmental expert group on cybercrime and the recommendations made by the open-ended intergovernmental expert group on protection against trafficking in cultural property. Many speakers noted with concern the lack of consistent and predictable funding available to UNODC and underlined the need to increase regular budget funding for core activities. Many speakers welcomed the adoption of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which was viewed as an important step in combating that particularly serious form of organized crime. In particular, speakers noted the importance of the establishment of the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, to provide adequate financial, social and other support to victims of trafficking in persons. Several speakers expressed their strong support for Conference decision 4/5, in which States parties were urged to consider the advisability of establishing an open-ended intergovernmental working group on the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. In addition, speakers called upon States parties to collaborate towards that end. Some speakers reported having taken steps to bring their national legislation into conformity with the requirements of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. A number of speakers welcomed the progress made by UNODC in developing a comprehensive self-assessment software ("the omnibus survey software") to facilitate data collection and dissemination, assist countries in monitoring progress made in the implementation of the Convention and help States better identify their technical assistance needs in that regard. Many speakers urged the Conference to move quickly to establish a formal mechanism to review the implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto, particularly in light of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention. Many speakers stressed that a formal review mechanism reflecting all aspects of the instruments would help to identify common and individual challenges, offer solutions for greater implementation and provide an opportunity to identify needs for technical assistance. Some speakers suggested that the recently adopted mechanism for the review of the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption could serve as a basis for further deliberations on that issue. V. Review of the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto A. United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime At its 4th meeting, on 19 October 2010, the Conference considered agenda item 2 (a), entitled "Review of the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto: United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime". For its consideration of the item, the Conference had before it the following: (a) Report of the Secretariat on the development of tools to gather information from States on the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto (CTOC/COP/2010/10); (b) Status of ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto and notifications, declarations and reservations thereto (CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.4); (c) Status of responses to the questionnaires and the checklist on the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto (CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.6). Two representatives of the Secretariat made an introductory statement and an audio-visual presentation. Statements were made by the representatives of Argentina, Chile (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Latin American and Caribbean Group), Croatia, Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka and Australia. The observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta also made a statement. 1. Deliberations Several speakers highlighted the fact that fighting transnational organized crime was a shared responsibility that required concerted and collective global action. They noted that national, regional and international efforts were required to fully implement the Convention and the need to better understand the root causes of transnational organized crime. Speakers provided practical examples demonstrating progress made by their Governments in implementing the Convention and the Protocols thereto, such as the adoption of national legislation and national legislative and programme initiatives related to the fight against transnational organized crime. Many speakers underlined the crucial importance of regional and international cooperation to better tackle transnational organized crime and to ensure the full use of the Convention. States were also encouraged to criminalize all the offences established by the Convention and its three Protocols, with a view to ensuring the effectiveness of international cooperation mechanisms such as for mutual legal assistance and extradition. Speakers underscored the need for technical assistance in order to assist States in preventing and combating organized crime and to better implement the Convention and the Protocols thereto. The importance of ensuring sustainable and predictable funding to enable UNODC to conduct such activities was underlined. It was noted that coordination among donors was essential in order to avoid duplication of efforts and the inefficient use of resources. Several speakers stressed the necessity of assessing the implementation of the Convention 10 years after its adoption and in that connection, mentioned the usefulness of the comprehensive self-assessment software (the "omnibus survey software"). Some speakers underscored that a strong and effective review mechanism would enable States parties to obtain reliable and consistent information concerning the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. Such a review mechanism could help identify gaps and highlight successful experiences and good practices, as well as technical assistance needs. It was noted that the Open-ended Working Group of Government Experts on Technical Assistance was an appropriate forum to exchange expertise and experience with regard to the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. 2. Action taken by the Conference At its 10th meeting, on 22 October 2010, the Conference adopted a revised draft resolution (CTOC/COP/2010/L.7/Rev.1) sponsored by Belgium (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, France, Guatemala, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Serbia and Switzerland. (For the text see chapter I, section A, resolution 5/1.) Prior to the adoption of the revised draft resolution, a representative of the Secretariat read a statement on the financial implications of such adoption. (For the text, see annex I.) B. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children At its 4th and 5th meetings, on 19 and 20 October 2010, the Conference considered agenda item 2 (b), entitled "Review of the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto: Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children". For its consideration of the item, the Conference had before it the following: (a) Report of the Secretariat on victim support, witness protection and participation of victims in the criminal justice system and other activities in support of the implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC/COP/2010/5); (b) Report submitted by the Chair of the Working Group on the activities of the Working Group on Trafficking in Persons (CTOC/COP/2010/6); (c) Report of the Secretariat on the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (CTOC/COP/2010/11); (d) Preliminary results of the independent evaluation of the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.3); (e) Status of ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto and notifications, declarations and reservations thereto (CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.4). The Chair of the Working Group on Trafficking in Persons presented the report of the Working Group (CTOC/COP/2010/6). The Director of the Division for Operations of UNODC made an introductory statement. The Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, also made a statement. Statements were made by the representatives of Chile (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Latin American and Caribbean Group), Croatia, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, the United States, Germany, Indonesia, Belarus, Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Norway, Mexico, Kenya and Chile. The observer for the signatory State Japan also made a statement. The observers for Lawyers without Borders and the Global Alliance against Traffic in Women also made statements. A number of speakers referred to trafficking in persons as a serious form of organized crime, affecting equally countries of origin, transit and destination, thus requiring a holistic approach that balanced criminal justice aspects with human rights. It was noted that a comprehensive approach should address the root causes and the demand side of trafficking in persons in all its forms. Several speakers reported on measures taken at the national level to combat trafficking in persons, including ratification of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and the adoption of legislation. Other actions included the adoption of national action plans; the establishment of national coordination mechanisms; the adoption of dispositions for the non-criminalization of victims of trafficking; the development of awareness-raising activities; the development of bilateral and regional agreements; and support mechanisms for victims of trafficking that addressed their needs in the course of the repatriation and reintegration processes. Some speakers also highlighted the importance of seizing and recovering assets that could be used to provide support to victims, including through funds for compensation. Speakers emphasized the need to exchange good practices, carry out targeted research and gather data on the crime of trafficking in persons in order to develop knowledge-based responses. Some speakers highlighted that there was an insufficient understanding of the definitions of trafficking in persons and related concepts such as exploitation. Several speakers emphasized the need to strengthen the coordination of efforts at all levels, within and between States and among all relevant stakeholders. Some speakers proposed the development of a plan for the effective implementation of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol so as to support the implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/293. In that context, it was recommended that the mandate of the Working Group on Trafficking in Persons be extended to work on such a plan to implement the Protocol. In that context, the recommendations of the Working Group were welcomed. Some speakers pointed out that the Trafficking in Persons Protocol constituted a road map for a comprehensive fight against trafficking in persons. It was noted that the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT) would, among other possibilities, make a good support platform for the implementation of the Global Plan of Action. Speakers also noted the possibility of extending UN.GIFT, and of discussing its management and governance, on the basis of the evaluation of the Global Initiative, in order to ensure the sustainability of its efforts. It was also suggested that more funding be dedicated to regional activities and support structures for victims. Some speakers highlighted the role of UNODC and other international organizations in providing technical assistance to combat trafficking in persons. Speakers expressed appreciation for the tools developed by UNODC and the cooperation between their Governments and UNODC. At its 10th meeting, on 22 October 2010, the Conference adopted a draft resolution (CTOC/COP/2010/L.5), as revised, sponsored by Argentina, Canada, Colombia, Guatemala, Israel, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, Switzerland and the United States. (For the text, see chapter I, section A, resolution 5/2.) Prior to the adoption of the draft resolution, as revised, a representative of the Secretariat read a statement on the financial implications of such adoption. (For the text, see annex II.) Following adoption of the resolution, the representative of Oman made a statement on behalf of the Group of Arab States, welcoming the adoption by States parties of paragraphs 9, 12 and 13 of the resolution, which dealt with a very important aspect of dealing with trafficking in persons, in particular trafficking in human organs, as defined in article 3 of the Trafficking in Persons Protocol. He noted that the Arab Group shared the serious concern with regard to that phenomenon and its extremely negative impact, in particular in countries under foreign occupation, and that agreement on the above-mentioned paragraphs had been successfully reached owing to the work of the group to maintain a spirit of consensus. The Arab Group would like to continue to cooperate with the expert group on trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal mentioned in paragraph 12 of the resolution. The speaker expressed the hope that that situation, in particular in occupied Arab territories, would be highlighted, as well as other aspects related to people in general, in particular women and children, who were in a vulnerable position due to poverty, lack of development and inequality of opportunities. The representative of Israel noted that his country had taken significant measures in the ongoing fight against transnational organized crime and trafficking in persons, as evidenced by the country's remarkable success, such as the great reduction in the number of victims of trafficking, and he was greatly saddened by the fact that the session on the Conference of the Parties to the Organized Crime Convention had been marred by those who repeatedly chose to politicize the forum and time and again put forward, in a distorted and non-factual manner, subject matters that had no place in that respected international forum. The representative reiterated the hope that that important forum would take every measure possible to thwart the hijacking of the important discussion of that forum in the future. C. Expert consultation on the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air At its 6th meeting, on 20 October 2010, the Conference considered agenda item 2 (c), entitled "Review of the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto: expert consultation on the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air". For its consideration of the item, the Conference had before it the following: (a) Report of the Secretariat on activities of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to promote and support the implementation of the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC/COP/2010/7); (b) Status of ratification of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto and notifications, declarations and reservations thereto as at 29 September 2010 (CTOC/COP/ 2010/CRP.4). A representative of the Secretariat made an introductory statement. Statements were made by the representatives of Chile (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Latin American and Caribbean Group), Algeria, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Chile, Indonesia, Argentina, the United States, Australia and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. The observer for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also made a statement. A number of speakers welcomed the holding of the expert consultation on the Smuggling of Migrants Protocol. Several speakers noted that their Governments had made progress in taking steps to implement the Smuggling of Migrants Protocol, including by adopting legislation, implementing national plans and strategies, and strengthening cooperation with regional and international organizations. A number of speakers stressed the need to fully implement the Protocol and for greater international cooperation, in particular among countries of origin, transit and destination. Some speakers stressed the need to address the connection between the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons, and the overlap between those crimes and other forms of transnational organized crime. A number of speakers highlighted the importance of targeting the organized criminal groups involved in, among other activities, the smuggling of migrants. Some speakers emphasized the use of fraudulent identity and travel documents in smuggling. It was stated that corruption was both a driving force and a product of the smuggling of migrants. Several speakers stressed the need to gather and exchange information regularly about trends, routes, modus operandi and other aspects of smuggling of migrants. Several speakers underscored the need to balance criminal justice aspects of the smuggling of migrants with a human rights approach that addressed root causes such as poverty and unemployment, while adequately protecting smuggled migrants from violence and xenophobia regardless of their immigration status. It was noted that smuggled migrants who were witnesses to crime had to be protected in order to ensure the successful prosecution of smugglers. It was noted that border control alone was insufficient to prevent the smuggling of migrants and that a balanced approach that also addressed the push factors of migration was needed. Speakers called for the criminalization of the smuggling of migrants in domestic legislation and noted that laws should be enforced and sanctions must reflect the gravity of the offence. Several speakers welcomed the publication of the Model Law against the Smuggling of Migrants as a tool that would assist States in strengthening legislation. Several speakers highlighted the need to develop a concerted approach to prosecution, prevention, protection and cooperation. In that context, it was noted that the technical assistance, training and policy development tools of UNODC were valuable in providing operational and practical guidance in the implementation of the Smuggling of Migrants Protocol. Some speakers also encouraged the Conference to establish an intergovernmental working group on the smuggling of migrants that could serve as a useful forum for exchanging information on experiences and challenges in addressing the smuggling of migrants with a view to strengthening implementation of the Protocol. At its 10th meeting, on 22 October 2010, the Conference adopted a revised draft resolution (CTOC/COP/2010/L.4/Rev.2) sponsored by Argentina, Australia, Belgium (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union), Canada, Guatemala and the United States. (For the text see chapter I, section A, resolution 5/3.) Prior to the adoption of the revised draft resolution, a representative of the Secretariat read a statement on the financial implications of such adoption. (For the text, see annex III.) D. Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition At its 5th and 6th meetings, on 20 October 2010, the Conference considered agenda item 2 (d), entitled "Review of the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto: Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition". For its consideration of the item, the Conference had before it the following: (a) Report of the Secretariat on activities of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to promote and support the implementation of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC/COP/2010/8); Statements were made by the representatives of Chile (on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Latin American and Caribbean Group), Argentina, Croatia, Zimbabwe, the United States, Italy and Mexico. The Coordinator of the International Small Arms Control Standards project of the Coordinating Action on Small Arms (CASA) mechanism made a statement. The observer for the World Forum on the Future of Sport Shooting Activities also made a statement. Several speakers considered that the Firearms Protocol, as the first legally binding global instrument on that issue, provided a broad cooperation framework for preventing and combating the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition. Some speakers welcomed those States that had recently ratified the Firearms Protocol, bringing the number of States parties to 82, while expressing regret that the total number of ratifications remained low compared with the Organized Crime Convention and the Trafficking in Persons Protocol and the Smuggling of Migrants Protocol, and urged States that had not yet done so to ratify and implement the Firearms Protocol. Several delegates expressed concern regarding the levels of harm and violence resulting from trafficking in firearms and related forms of crime, including drug trafficking, money-laundering and terrorism. The importance of monitoring the flow of firearms, including through adequate transfer controls, and of strengthening national legislation to prevent and combat such trafficking was stressed. Some speakers underlined the need for continued international cooperation efforts in that regard, including the exchange of intelligence, the conduct of joint and simultaneous operations and the adoption of enhanced border control measures. Some speakers described the progress that their States had made in seeking to address the issue of trafficking in firearms with regard to legislation, firearm marking, and import and export control. A number of speakers expressed support for the work that UNODC had carried out at the regional and global levels to promote and support the ratification and implementation of the Firearms Protocol. They welcomed, in particular, the development of a model law on firearms, which they considered to be a valuable tool to assist Member States of different legal traditions in strengthening their legislation to effectively implement the Protocol. Speakers also encouraged the Secretariat to continue to make efforts to coordinate and cooperate with regional organizations and noted that important lessons could be learned from the implementation of similar instruments developed by those organizations. Several speakers requested the Conference to establish an open-ended intergovernmental working group on firearms that would promote the exchange of experiences and assist the Secretariat in identifying gaps and challenges in the implementation of the Firearms Protocol. A number of delegates asked UNODC to develop technical assistance activities to strengthen the capabilities of Member States in relation to firearms. The Coordinator of the International Small Arms Control Standards project of the CASA mechanism highlighted the relevance of the development of the Standards, whose purpose was to provide clear and comprehensive guidance to practitioners and policymakers on aspects of small arm and light weapon control in support of the Protocol. At its 9th meeting, on 22 October 2010, the Conference adopted a revised draft resolution (CTOC/COP/2010/L.3/Rev.2) sponsored by Chile, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria and Peru. (For the text, see chapter I, section A, resolution 5/4.) Prior to the adoption of the revised draft resolution, a representative of the Secretariat read a statement on the financial implications of such adoption. (For the text, see annex IV.) VI. Consideration of possible mechanisms to review implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto At its 6th meeting, on 20 October 2010, the Conference considered agenda item 3, entitled "Consideration of possible mechanisms to review implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto". For its consideration of the item, the Conference had before it the following: (b) Progress report and lessons learned from the pilot programme to review implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto (CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.1); The Deputy Director of the Division for Treaty Affairs made an introductory statement. Statements were made by the representatives of Chile (on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group), the Russian Federation, Ecuador, South Africa, Indonesia, Australia, the Philippines, Chile, Mexico, Romania and Argentina. The Conference also heard statements by the observer for the signatory State Japan. The observers for the Council of Europe and Legal Support for Children and Women also made statements. A. Deliberations Speakers acknowledged that the Organized Crime Convention and its Protocols provided an effective and comprehensive framework for combating organized crime. Many speakers stated that, as 10 years had passed since the adoption of the Convention, an effective and strong mechanism to review the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols was needed as soon as possible. Some speakers emphasized that the review of the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols, pursuant to article 32 of the Convention, was a key mandate of the Conference. Some speakers considered that discussion about other possibilities should be carried out carefully and progressively. Some speakers noted the work of the open-ended intergovernmental meeting of experts on possible mechanisms to review implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. They made reference to the experts' recommendation that the Conference establish a working group, inter alia, to prepare terms of reference for a possible review mechanism. Speakers noted that as long as there was commitment to the idea of such a mechanism, specific details and terms of reference could be agreed upon later. Many speakers recounted their positive experience in the pilot programme established as a technical assistance project to assist States parties in reviewing, on a voluntary basis, their implementation of the Convention. In general, they highlighted the cooperative spirit that had prevailed during the reviews and emphasized that the pilot programme had been an exercise in confidence-building, mutual learning and in-depth dialogue in a positive climate of respect and trust. It was underlined that the pilot programme demonstrated that a review mechanism could be a tool for cooperation rather than an instrument of control. Speakers stressed that a review mechanism for the Convention and its Protocols would lend credibility to the instruments, assist in advancing their implementation, identify gaps and inform technical assistance needs. Some speakers recalled the essential principles underlying a review mechanism, such as inclusiveness, transparency, openness, efficiency, impartiality and the importance of avoiding duplication. Other speakers emphasized that experiences that had led to the adoption of a review mechanism for the United Nations Convention against Corruption might be instructive in the context of the Organized Crime Convention and its Protocols, and the possibility of using other models would require careful consideration. While several speakers were supportive of a peer review model, it was acknowledged that adapting such a model to the unique elements of the Organized Crime Convention and its Protocols would require careful consideration. Several speakers noted that adopting a review mechanism would entail a number of challenges, such as how to review four separate legal instruments bearing in mind the scope and variety of their provisions, the large number of experts required for the review process and the disparate ratification status of each instrument. Many speakers emphasized that funds from the regular budget of the United Nations should be used to finance any review mechanism adopted in order to ensure its predictability and objectivity. Some speakers underlined the important role that civil society should play in any possible review mechanism. Many speakers felt that, in view of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention, the current session of the Conference represented an excellent occasion to agree on the principle of a review mechanism for the Convention and the Protocols. Speakers emphasized that progress should be made during the current session of the Conference towards the adoption of a review mechanism. B. Action taken by the Conference At its 10th meeting, on 22 October 2010, the Conference adopted a revised draft resolution (CTOC/COP/2010/L.6/Rev.1) sponsored by Argentina, Australia, Belgium (on behalf of the European Union), Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Finland, Guatemala, Israel, Italy, Kuwait, Mexico, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Switzerland and the United States. (For the text, see chapter I, section A, resolution 5/5.) Prior to the adoption of the revised draft resolution, a representative of the Secretariat read a statement on the financial implications of such adoption. (For the text, see annex V.) VII. Technical assistance At its 6th and 7th meetings, on 20 and 21 October 2010, the Conference considered agenda item 4, entitled "Technical assistance". For its consideration of the item, the Conference had before it the following documents: (a) Working paper prepared by the Secretariat on technical assistance programmes, proposals and future programmes envisaged in the priority areas determined by the Conference and the Working Group of Government Experts on Technical Assistance (CTOC/COP/2010/4); (b) Note by the Secretariat on technical assistance requested for the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto (CTOC/COP/2010/9). The Chair of the Open-ended Working Group of Government Experts on Technical Assistance briefed the Conference on their deliberations and presented the recommendations of the Working Group for consideration by the Conference. Statements were made by the representatives of Chile (on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group), the Russian Federation, Ecuador, South Africa, Indonesia and Australia. The Conference also heard statements by the observers for the following signatory States: Japan and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Speakers expressed appreciation for the efforts of UNODC to deliver high-quality technical assistance and noted that such assistance was crucial in helping States parties to implement the Convention successfully. In particular, the programme approach taken by UNODC was commended because of its improved strategic positioning, its consistency with United Nations reform and system-wide coherence efforts and its potential to support and promote oversight of technical assistance by Member States. A number of speakers noted the importance of the five priority areas for technical assistance: (a) raising awareness and promoting the ratification of the Convention, which should continue to be seen as the primary starting point for any technical assistance; (b) the collection of data to ensure targeted and relevant technical assistance according to national priorities; (c) the pooling and sharing of data both for the development of regional and national programmes and with other actors delivering technical assistance in this area in order to ensure coordinated responses and avoid duplication; (d) strengthening of judicial cooperation and development of approved frameworks for the protection of victims and witnesses; and (e) the development of national and regional strategies to enhance capacity and promote international cooperation. Speakers welcomed the work of UNODC in developing and piloting the comprehensive self-assessment software ("omnibus survey software"), which should contribute to more detailed and focused set of national priorities for technical assistance. The need to continue gathering information and ensuring that technical assistance moved forward on a strong evidence-based platform was emphasized as a priority. Some speakers called upon the Secretariat to produce the software in all six official languages of the United Nations in order that the tool might be used with maximum efficacy and to continue to refine and improve the software during the intersessional period, with a view to possibly adopting it at the next session of the Conference. It was noted that effective legal frameworks and that harmonization of legislation across a region were critical to ensuring an effective response. The Secretariat's work to develop model laws and other tools was noted with appreciation, as were the efforts to provide custom-tailored support to States within the framework of their own national legislative frameworks. A number of speakers commented on the need for effective technical assistance to enhance the capacity of law enforcement institutions presenting successful national, bilateral and regional initiatives carried out in their own countries. In particular, those speakers highlighted the importance of building capacity for international cooperation in technical assistance. Regional initiatives were welcomed by a number of speakers, and it was noted that UNODC should coordinate its delivery of technical assistance with the efforts of other international organizations in order to avoid duplication of efforts. Speakers also emphasized the need to ensure that national priorities and needs for technical assistance were taken into account. Speakers expressed concern regarding the increasing number of cases of maritime piracy, counterfeit medicine, environmental crime, trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking in organs and the use of cybercrime and new technology for identity-related crimes. Given the prevalence of identity-related crimes, one speaker requested that the Secretariat build national capacity in digital evidence management. UNODC was encouraged to continue strengthening knowledge, capacity and collaborative approaches of Member States in order to tackle these threats. Speakers emphasized that the Conference should consider those new types of crime and that the Organized Crime Convention was sufficiently robust and dynamic to meet the complex new manifestations of transnational organized crime. A number of speakers called on States to recognize the need for sustained and predictable funding for UNODC to ensure that technical assistance programmes were effective and sustainable over the long term. Upon request, the Secretariat reviewed the status of funding for the Organized Crime Convention component of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund, which was established under article 30, paragraph 2, of the Convention to support the delivery of technical assistance. The generous donations of a number of Member States were welcomed, although it was also noted that there remained a shortfall of $2.9 million in the Fund to meet requests for assistance. It was stated that general-purpose funding had decreased by more than one third, and the Conference was urged to exercise caution by ensuring that adequate resources were available when calling upon UNODC to undertake additional tasks. At its 10th meeting, on 22 October 2010, the Conference adopted a draft resolution (CTOC/COP/2010/L.9) sponsored by Kenya and Nigeria. (For the text, see chapter I, section A, resolution 5/6.) Prior to the adoption of the draft resolution, a representative of the Secretariat read a statement on the financial implications of such adoption. (For the text, see annex VI.) VIII. Expert consultation on the use of the Convention for combating emerging forms of crime At its 8th meeting, on 21 October 2010, the Conference considered agenda item 5, entitled "Expert consultation on the use of the Convention for combating emerging forms of crime". For its consideration of the item, the Conference had before it the following documents: (a) Note by the Secretariat on activities of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to address emerging forms of crime (CTOC/COP/2010/3); (b) Note by the Secretariat on the use of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime for protection against trafficking in cultural property (CTOC/COP/2010/12). A representative of the Secretariat made a presentation outlining the applicability of the Convention, given its broad scope and definitions, in addressing emerging crimes such as cybercrime, piracy, environmental crime and trafficking in human organs, counterfeit medicines and cultural property. It was noted that most of the so-called "emerging" crimes were not necessarily new phenomena but, rather, were known offences that were becoming increasingly evident. Statements were made by the representatives of Chile (on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group), the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, South Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Ecuador, Norway, Australia, Algeria, Argentina, Canada, the Dominican Republic and Chile. The observers for the signatory States Japan and Viet Nam also made statements. The representative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the observer for Greenpeace also made statements. Several speakers recommended that the issue of emerging crimes should be retained in the agenda of future sessions of the Conference. Speakers emphasized that the broad scope of application of the Organized Crime Convention permitted its provisions on international cooperation to be effectively utilized for new and emerging forms of crime, and called upon States to fully ratify and implement the Convention and its Protocols. Many speakers addressed the threat posed by cybercrime and the challenges faced by the international community in combating a crime unhindered by borders. Some speakers underlined that many States had to continue to make progress in terms of policy formulation and legislation, while others described their countries' efforts to strengthen national legislation and establish specialized agencies to deal more effectively with cybercrime offences. Speakers called for closer cooperation in information security, training and the sharing of good practices to address cybercrime and related offences. Speakers welcomed the conveying of an open-ended intergovernmental expert group in 2011 to conduct a comprehensive study of the problem of cybercrime and responses to it taken by Member States, the international community and the private sector, with a view to examining options for strengthening existing national and international legal and other responses to cybercrime and proposing new such responses. Some speakers stressed the importance of ensuring equitable geographical representation among participants in that exercise. Others stressed the need for harmonized legislative approaches to cybercrime and welcomed the consideration of a possible new legal instrument on cybercrime. Concern was expressed at the growing incidence of piracy and its development into a highly lucrative industry, thus threatening the lives of seafarers and adversely impacting upon international commerce. It was suggested that States should participate in and support national, regional and international efforts to criminalize and prosecute crimes of piracy, and make the best use of the Organized Crime Convention to promote greater international cooperation in fighting piracy. Some speakers also acknowledged the efforts of UNODC in providing technical assistance to assist States in investigating and prosecuting piracy cases. Several speakers expressed their concern regarding environment-related crimes such as illegal logging, illegal fishing and wildlife trafficking, in which organized criminal groups threatened biodiversity in their quest for profits. Illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing was not only an environmental threat but also an organized criminal activity, as it diverted revenue from Governments, which regulated the legal fishing industry. The serious consequence of unemployment arising from illegal mining of and trafficking in precious metals were also noted, as was the fact that such criminal groups were involved in other forms of criminality, such as illicit trafficking in drugs and firearms. Many speakers underlined that the involvement of organized crime in environment-related trafficking was leading to potentially devastating outcomes for forests, fish species and the communities that relied on those resources. However, other speakers expressed the view that the criminalization of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing as a transnational organized crime needed to be considered carefully, because of the legal and practical impact that such criminalization might have. Several speakers stressed that counterfeiting of medicine was a growing problem in their countries and expressed concern at the threat that it posed to public health and the damage caused to holders of intellectual property that were engaged in the development of new medicines. Delegates requested UNODC to cooperate with other relevant international organizations such as the World Health Organization and make full use of their expertise. Speakers acknowledged that trafficking in human organs was an emerging form of crime that needed to be addressed in a coordinated effort by the international community. Many speakers noted with concern the growing phenomenon of illicit trafficking in cultural property and the increasing involvement of organized criminal groups in such trafficking. Some speakers emphasized the importance of protecting cultural heritage. The sophisticated nature of that crime and its links to other forms of crime were noted. Speakers emphasized the need to make trafficking in cultural property a serious criminal offence, with a view to countering the criminal networks involved in its illicit traffic. Many speakers underlined the importance of strengthening international cooperation, specifically through extradition and mutual legal assistance, and facilitating the recovery and return of cultural property. Speakers welcomed Economic and Social Council resolution 2010/19, in which the Council welcomed the note by the Secretariat containing the recommendations of the expert group on protection against trafficking in cultural property. Some speakers recommended that the group explore possible new legislative developments, such as a new protocol to the Organized Crime Convention, while others considered that States should make more effective use of the existing instruments, including the Organized Crime Convention. Speakers encouraged UNODC to work closely with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and to develop guidelines in the area of crime prevention. At its 10th meeting, on 22 October 2010, the Conference adopted a revised draft resolution (CTOC/COP/2010/L.8/Rev.1) sponsored by Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), China, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).

Prior to the adoption of the revised draft resolution, a representative of the Secretariat read a statement on the financial implications of such adoption. (For the text, see annex VII.) IX. International cooperation, with particular emphasis on extradition, mutual legal assistance and international cooperation for the purpose of confiscation, and the establishment and strengthening of central authorities At its 8th meeting, on 21 October 2010, the Conference considered agenda item 6, entitled "International cooperation, with particular emphasis on extradition, mutual legal assistance and international cooperation for the purpose of confiscation, and the establishment and strengthening of central authorities". For its consideration of the item, the Conference had before it the following: (a) Report of the Secretariat on activities of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to promote the implementation of the provisions on international cooperation in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC/COP/2010/2); (b) Working paper prepared by the Secretariat on technical assistance programmes, proposals and future programmes envisaged in the priority areas determined by the Conference and the Working Group of Government Experts on Technical Assistance (CTOC/COP/2010/4); (c) Note by the Secretariat technical and legal obstacles to the use of videoconferencing (CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.2); (d) Catalogue of cases involving extradition, mutual legal assistance and other forms of international legal cooperation requested on the basis of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.5 and Corr.1). The Chair of the third meeting of the open-ended working group of government experts on extradition, mutual legal assistance, and international cooperation for the purposes of confiscation presented a summary of the outcome of the meeting. He reported that the working group meeting provided a great opportunity for experts from different regions to meet and engage in substantive discussions on the provisions of the Organized Crime Convention related to international cooperation. The Chair also mentioned that, throughout the meeting, experts had provided many interesting and relevant examples of the hundreds of cases in which the Convention and its Protocols had been used for confiscation, extradition and mutual legal assistance requests. The Chair highlighted that, as in the past, the working group meeting had been an important forum for national experts to address challenges and share best practices relating to international cooperation. The Chair presented the recommendations of the working group aimed at strengthening international cooperation, which had been formulated by experts on the basis of the discussions held during the third meeting of the working group. Statements were made by the representatives of Chile (on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group), Romania, China, Canada and Argentina. Several speakers highlighted the importance of using the Convention for extradition, mutual legal assistance and international cooperation for the purposes of confiscation, either as the sole legal basis for such action or in conjunction with other international cooperation treaties. The need to fully implement the Convention in order to combat transnational organized crime was stressed. Speakers highlighted that the use of the provisions on international cooperation of the Convention in combating a large number of crimes, including cybercrime, asset recovery, money-laundering and the confiscation of illicit assets. Many speakers expressed appreciation for the legal tools developed by UNODC, such as the Mutual Legal Assistance Request Writer Tool, now available in 10 languages, and the Legislative Guides for the Implementation of the United Nations Organized Crime Convention and the Protocols Thereto. Some speakers also underscored the usefulness of workshops to train practitioners on how to use the Mutual Legal Assistance Request Writer Tool to draft mutual legal assistance requests. It was noted that it would be useful to have a single unified directory that also included the central authorities under the Convention against Corruption. Speakers underlined the need for training and technical assistance to reinforce capacities of national authorities and to permit the efficient use of the Organized Crime Convention and its Protocols in dealing with extradition, mutual legal assistance and confiscation requests. It was also noted that the catalogue of cases involving extradition, mutual legal assistance and other forms of international legal cooperation (CTOC/COP/2010/CRP.5 and Corr.1) was a very important tool. Some speakers emphasized the usefulness of technology in facilitating international cooperation. Online networking and videoconferencing, especially when used to obtain oral testimony of witnesses, were mentioned in that regard. Several speakers underlined the importance of cooperation at the international level, as well as at the subregional and regional levels, at which the homogeneous nature of legal systems could facilitate cooperation. Practitioners were also encouraged to share best practices in order to combat organized crime more effectively. At its 9th meeting, on 22 October 2010, the Conference adopted a revised draft resolution (CTOC/COP/2010/L.2/Rev.1) sponsored by Belgium (on behalf of the European Union), Guatemala, Israel, the Russian Federation and Serbia.

The representative of Chile (on behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean Group) made a statement. The Conference also heard a statement by the observer for the signatory State Islamic Republic of Iran. Some speakers expressed their concern with regard to the financial situation of UNODC and its excessive dependence on extrabudgetary resources, highlighting that the situation of the funding of the Conference was not different from the financial situation of UNODC. Speakers recognized the efforts of the open-ended working group on governance and finance and encouraged it to follow up on the development of thematic and regional programmes and look for a specific financing mechanism for the implementation of the Convention. Speakers also expressed their concern about the widening gap between the mandates given to UNODC and the resources provided to the Secretariat to fulfil those mandates, and suggested that either a greater amount of regular budget resources should be requested from United Nations Headquarters or Member States should be requested to increase their voluntary contribution to support the Conference.

With regard to resource requirements for 2012-2013, they would be reviewed in the context of established budgetary procedures. 6. With regard to the request contained in operative paragraphs 6 and 7, it is estimated that additional extrabudgetary resources in the amount of $800,000 to $1,200,000 would be required for the translation and distribution of the "omnibus tool" (from 600 to 900 pages in six languages, 800 copies). 7. Should the additional extrabudgetary resources mentioned in the paragraphs above not be provided, the activities will not take place. 9. Hence, adoption of revised draft resolution CTOC/COP/2010/L.6/Rev.1 would not entail any additional appropriation under the programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011.

Under the terms of subparagraphs (f), (g), (k) and (l) of the annex to the draft resolution, the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime would: (a) Note that the comprehensive self-assessment software ("omnibus survey software") shall be used as a tool to facilitate the gathering of information on the implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto, and request the Secretariat to further improve that software, including by making it available in all the official languages of the Conference, to continue to consult with States parties and signatories with a view to finalizing it as soon as possible and to submit it to the open-ended intergovernmental working group established by the resolution for its consideration; (b) Request the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to continue to share information gathered on technical assistance needs with other possible providers of technical assistance, in particular information on needs at the country level, in order to coordinate assistance activities with beneficiary countries; (c) Request the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to provide technical assistance to help Member States to apply, where appropriate, the provisions of the Convention to new forms and dimensions of transnational organized crime that fall within the scope of the Convention and that are of common concern to States parties, and to report to the Conference at its sixth session on progress made on this matter; (d) Request the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to consider, in consultation with Member States, the development of specific tools, such as best practices, legislative guidelines and model provisions, that would help Member States to apply, where appropriate, the provisions of the Convention to new forms and dimensions of transnational organized crime that fall within the scope of the Convention and that are of common concern to States parties. 3. The request contained in the draft resolution would be subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources. UNODC will implement such activities subject to the availability of assistance from States parties and signatory States. 4. With regard to the request contained in operative paragraph (f), it is estimated that additional extrabudgetary resources in the amount of $800,000 to $1,200,000 would be required for the translation and distribution of the "omnibus software" (from 600 to 900 pages in six languages, 800 copies). 5. Should the additional extrabudgetary resources mentioned above not be provided, the activities will not take place. 6. The attention of the Conference is drawn to the provisions of section VI of General Assembly resolution 45/248 B, in which the Assembly reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters; and reaffirmed also the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. The attention of the Conference of the Parties is also drawn to paragraph 67 of the first report of the Advisory Committee on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 (A/54/7), in which the Committee notes that the use of the phrase "within existing resources" or similar language in resolutions has a negative impact on the implementation of activities. 7. Hence, adoption of draft resolution CTOC/COP/2010/L.9 would not entail any additional appropriation under the programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011.

This report will be part of the background documents for the sixth session of the Conference. The resource requirements for the biennium 2012-2013 will be reviewed in the context of established budgetary procedures. 4.
