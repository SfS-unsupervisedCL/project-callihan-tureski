Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General; 2. Reaffirms that the United Nations has a central role in promoting international cooperation for development and in promoting policy coherence on global development issues, including in the context of globalization and interdependence; 3. Recognizes that only through broad and sustained efforts at all levels, including policies and measures at the national and global levels to create a shared future based upon a common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable and thus have a positive impact on development; 4. Reaffirms the need to improve mutual supportiveness by fulfilling the commitments made, as agreed, at all United Nations conferences and summits, including those of the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 in order to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the context of globalization and interdependence; 5. Underlines that in order to make globalization work for all, it is essential to invest in basic economic and social infrastructure, social services and social protection, including education, health, nutrition, shelter and social security programmes, which take special care of children and older persons and are gender-sensitive and fully inclusive of the rural sector and all disadvantaged communities and are vital for enabling people, especially people living in poverty, to better adapt to and benefit from changing economic conditions and opportunities; 6. Also underlines the critical need to reinforce national efforts in capacity-building in developing countries and countries with economies in transition in such areas as institutional infrastructure, human resource development, public finance, mortgage finance, financial regulation and supervision, basic education, public administration, social and gender budget policies, early warning and crisis prevention, and debt management; 7. Stresses the need for the United Nations system to continue to address the social dimension of globalization, and in that regard encourages the International Labour Organization's work on the social dimension of globalization; 8. Recognizes the right of countries to choose independently their own paths to development and national poverty reduction strategies; 9. Reiterates that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends, inter alia, on good governance within each country and at the international level. Sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and employment creation. Transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and the commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system are equally essential; 10. Notes that important international efforts are under way to reform the international financial architecture, emphasizes that those efforts need to be sustained with greater transparency and the effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and that one major objective of the reform is to enhance financing for development and poverty eradication, and underscores the commitment, set forth in paragraph 53 of the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development,2 to sound domestic financial sectors, which make a vital contribution to national development efforts, as an important component of an international financial architecture that is supportive of development; 11. Takes note of the communiqu√© of the joint International Monetary Fund/World Bank Development Committee of 28 September 2002, in particular paragraph 10, on the need to identify pragmatic and innovative ways to further enhance participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in international decision-making and norm-setting, and encourages all relevant international financial institutions to take concrete measures to that end; 12. Welcomes the commitment by all countries to promote national and global economic systems based on the principles of justice, equity, democracy, participation, transparency, accountability and inclusion, as contained in the Monterrey Consensus; 13. Calls for the integrated consideration of trade, finance, investment, technology transfer and developmental issues, and to that end re-emphasizes the urgency of coherent action by the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization, as appropriate, along with the action of Governments, to promote equitable and broad sharing in the benefits of globalization, taking into account the specific vulnerabilities, concerns and needs of developing countries; 14. Expresses its concern about the adoption of a number of unilateral actions that are not consistent with World Trade Organization rules, harm the exports of all countries, in particular those of developing countries, and have a considerable bearing on the ongoing World Trade Organization negotiations and on the achievement and further enhancement of the development dimension of the trade negotiations; 15. Stresses the special importance of creating an enabling international economic environment through strong cooperative efforts by all countries and institutions to promote equitable economic development in a world economy that benefits all people, and in that context invites developed countries, in particular major industrialized countries, which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth, when formulating their macroeconomic policies, to take into account whether their effects in terms of the external economic environment would be favourable to growth and development; 16. Also stresses the need to promote corporate responsibility and accountability, including through the full development and effective implementation of intergovernmental agreements and measures, international initiatives and public-private partnerships, and appropriate national regulations, and to support continuous improvement in corporate practices in all countries; 17. Further stresses the role of the United Nations in addressing the digital divide in the context of globalization and the development process of developing countries and in promoting coherence and synergies between various regional and international initiatives, including the Information and Communication Technologies Task Force and the Digital Opportunities Task Force; 18. Urges developed countries to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition in narrowing the digital divide, creating digital opportunities and harnessing the potential of information and communication technologies for development, through technology transfer on mutually agreed terms and the provision of financial and technical support, and in that context to support the World Summit on the Information Society; 19. Encourages developing countries to continue to pursue appropriate development policies to promote economic development and poverty eradication, and in that regard invites the international community to pursue strategies that support those policies through continued efforts to address the problems of market access, persistent external debt, transfer of resources, financial vulnerability and declining terms of trade; 20. Strongly urges the international community to take all necessary and appropriate measures, including support for structural and macroeconomic reform, foreign direct investment, enhanced official development assistance, the search for a durable solution to the external debt problem, market access, capacity-building and the dissemination of knowledge and technology, in order to achieve sustainable development and promote the participation in the global economy of all African countries, as well as the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and small island developing States; 21. Emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the specific concerns of countries with economies in transition so as to help them to benefit from globalization, with a view to their full integration into the world economy; 22. Reaffirms its resolve to give greater opportunities to the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society in general to contribute to the realization of the goals and programmes of the United Nations and thereby to maximize opportunities and mitigate the negative economic and social consequences of globalization; 23. Emphasizes the importance of understanding the regional dimension in efforts to enhance global economic governance, inter alia, by fully utilizing the potential of regional commissions to facilitate the sharing of experiences and best practices, within their respective mandates; 24. Invites the international community to provide increased technical assistance and financial resources to developing countries in support of their efforts to build institutional capacities; 25. Calls upon the United Nations system to enhance its support at the country level for capacity-building activities in developing countries and to strengthen coordination of its efforts in that regard; 26. Invites all countries, as well as the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization, within their respective mandates, to continue to strengthen interactions with civil society, including the private sector and non-governmental organizations, as important partners in development; 27.
