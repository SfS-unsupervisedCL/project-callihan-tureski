civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council Promotion of a democratic and equitable international order The Human Rights Council, Recalling all previous resolutions of the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on this issue, in particular Assembly resolution 65/223 of 21 December 2010 and Council resolutions 8/5 of 18 June 2008, 18/6 of 29 September 2011 and 21/9 of 27 September 2012, Reaffirming the commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments relating to human rights and international law, Affirming that the enhancement of international cooperation for the promotion and protection of all human rights should continue to be carried out in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and of international law as set forth in Articles 1 and 2 of the Charter and, inter alia, with full respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence, the non-use of force or the threat of force in international relations and non-intervention in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State, Recalling the Preamble to the Charter, in particular the determination to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, Reaffirming that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized, Reaffirming also the determination expressed in the Preamble to the Charter to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, to practice tolerance and good neighbourliness, and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, Stressing that the responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social issues, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally and that, in this regard, the central role must be played by the United Nations as the most universal and representative organization in the world, Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter, including promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity, Recognizing that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights is essential for the full achievement of the purposes of the United Nations, including the effective promotion and protection of all human rights, Considering that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, Reaffirming that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives, Recognizing that the promotion and protection of human rights should be based on the principle of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the capacity of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all human beings, Emphasizing that democracy is not only a political concept, but that it also has economic and social dimensions, Recognizing that democracy, respect for all human rights, including the right to development, transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society, and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development, Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, the inequitable distribution of wealth, marginalization and social exclusion, Reaffirming that dialogue among religions, cultures and civilizations could contribute greatly to the enhancement of international cooperation at all levels, Underlining the fact that it is imperative for the international community to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people and that only through broad and sustained efforts, based on our common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable, Deeply concerned that the current global economic, financial, energy and food crises, resulting from a combination of several major factors, including macroeconomic and other factors, such as environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of financial resources and the technology necessary to confront their negative impact in developing countries, particularly in the least developed countries and small island developing States, represent a global scenario that is threatening the adequate enjoyment of all human rights and widening the gap between developed and developing countries, Stressing that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level that correspond to the needs of developing countries and countries with economies in transition and are formulated and implemented with their effective participation, Stressing also the need for adequate financing of, and technology transfer to, developing countries, in particular landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, including to support their efforts to adapt to climate change, Having listened to the peoples of the world, and recognizing their aspirations to justice, to equality of opportunity for all, to the enjoyment of their human rights, including the right to development, to live in peace and freedom and to equal participation without discrimination in economic, social, cultural, civil and political life, Resolved to take all measures within its power to secure a

Also reaffirms the need to continue working urgently for the establishment of an international economic order based on equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest and cooperation among all States, irrespective of their economic and social systems, in order to correct inequalities and redress existing injustices, make it possible to eliminate the widening gap between developed and developing countries and ensure steadily accelerating economic and social development and peace and justice for present and future generations; 12.
