UNITED NATIONS Distr. GENERAL S/1998/416 20 May 1998 ORIGINAL: ENGLISH LETTER DATED 18 MAY 1998 FROM THE CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES A.I. OF THE PERMANENT MISSION OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL Upon instructions from my Government, I have the honour to transmit a copy of a note verbale, with an enclosure, dated 5 January 1998, from the Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Washington, D.C., to the Embassy of Pakistan to be forwarded to the United States Department of State on the violation of territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the forces of the United States of America in the Persian Gulf region. It would be highly appreciated if the present letter and its annex were circulated as a document of the Security Council. (Signed) Majid TAKHT-RAVANCHI Ambassador Chargé d'affaires a.i. English Page Annex Note verbale dated 5 January 1998 from the Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Washington, D.C., addressed to the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, D.C. The Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Washington, D.C., presents its compliments to the Embassy of Pakistan and has the honour to transmit the attached message received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is respectfully requested that the text be transmitted to the United States Department of State and that our office be informed of its response. Appendix According to information received from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, on 16 August 1997 a United States Seahawk SH/60B LAMPS-type helicopter belonging to the United States warship Rentz, at the position of N29527 and E49542, crashed into the Islamic Republic of Iran's internal waters. Following this incident, other United States helicopters present in the area rescued the crew members of the crashed helicopter. Then three United States warships, including an army tugboat (ocean cruiser), Cataba, with the direct assistance of a Dutch tugboat, Smith Cyclone, tried to salvage the wreckage of the submerged helicopter by violating the internal waters of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran protests such unjustifiable actions by United States warships and insistent demands that such actions, being contrary to the principles of international and regional seafaring laws and which consequently violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran, be stopped at once.
