General Assembly Sixty-seventh session Agenda item 36 The situation in the Middle East Security Council Sixty-eighth year Identical letters dated 3 June 2013 from the Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council On instructions from my Government, I wish to inform you that the Israeli air force has continued to violate Lebanese airspace, intensifying its incursions over Lebanon, including flights at low altitude over Beirut, the capital, in the last few days. Such activities are a blatant violation of my country's sovereignty and the relevant international resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). They are also a clear infringement of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles and provisions of international law. On behalf of my Government, I call on the Security Council to condemn those violations in the strongest possible terms and prevail on Israel to end its violations of Lebanese sovereignty, whether in the air, at sea or on land, and fulfil all of its obligations under Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). I also take this opportunity to reiterate my Government's commitment to its obligations under international resolutions. I should be grateful if you would circulate the present letter as a document of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, under agenda item 36, and of the Security Council. (Signed) Nawaf Salam Ambassador Permanent Representative
