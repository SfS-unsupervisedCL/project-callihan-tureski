Sixty-eighth session Agenda items 42 and 76 Question of Cyprus Oceans and the law of the sea Letter dated 25 April 2014 from the Permanent Representative of Turkey to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General With reference to the letters of the Greek Cypriot representative dated 17 October 2013 (A/68/537-S/2013/622), 29 October 2013 (A/68/555-S/2013/634), 12 November 2013 (A/68/593-S/2013/662), 5 December 2013 (A/68/644-S/2013/720) and 13 February 2014 (A/68/759), I would like to bring to your attention the following considerations. The outer limits of Turkey's continental shelf in the maritime areas in the eastern Mediterranean that are west of longitude 32º 16′ 18″E were defined in the Turkish notes verbales No. 2004/Turkuno DT/4739, dated 2 March 2004, and No. 2013/14136816/22273, dated 12 March 2013. Moreover, Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus signed a Continental Shelf Delimitation Agreement on 21 September 2011. Geographical coordinates that draw the outer limit of Turkey's continental shelf in that part of the Mediterranean Sea and a map depicting the delimitation line are transmitted herewith (see annex). The areas claimed by the Greek Cypriots in the previously mentioned letters, in the north of the above-mentioned outer limits, fall entirely within Turkey's continental shelf. Therefore, Turkey refutes all the allegations contained in those letters. The other areas claimed by the Greek Cypriots in the above-mentioned letters that are in the south of the delimitation limits defined in the Continental Shelf Delimitation Agreement of 21 September 2011 between Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus fall within the jurisdiction of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. I would be grateful if the present letter and its annex could be circulated as a document of the General Assembly, under agenda items 42 and 76, and published in the next Law of the Sea Bulletin.
