Letter dated 22 July 2002 from the Chairman of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) concerning counter-terrorism addressed to the President of the Security Council I refer to my letter of 27 December 2001 (S/2001/1297) transmitting a report from the European Union submitted to the Counter-Terrorism Committee pursuant to paragraph 6 of resolution 1373 (2001). The Counter-Terrorism Committee has considered the report carefully with the assistance of its experts and has written to the European Union through the Permanent Representative of Spain to the United Nations to set out its preliminary comments. The European Union has been requested to provide a response in the form of a supplementary report by 2 September 2002. I should be grateful if you could arrange for the present letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council.
