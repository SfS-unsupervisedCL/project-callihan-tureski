提供 国家 内 不同 区域 贫困 状况 的 图表 。 应该 更加 强调 具体 区域 地方级 别的 评估 。 能否 获得 市场准入 应该 被视为 贫困 的 一个 重要 形成 因素 ， 因此 也 应 被 视为 土地 退化 的 一个 重要 因素 。 贫困 的 定性 和 量化 指标 都 应该 加以 考虑 。 不仅 成功 的 事例 ， 而且 失败 的 教训 ， 都 应该 作为 吸取 的 经益 。 贫困 / 土地 退化 存在 相互 联系 。 贫困 既 是 土地 退化 的 原因 ， 也 是 其 后果 ， 因此 造成 了 一 种 恶性循环 ， 对 此 需要 予以 考虑 。 目标 对象 应该 很 好 地 确定 。 社区 行动 和 社区 参与 对 具体 解决 土地 退化 与 贫困 之间 的 关系 至关重要 。 在 评估 贫困 与 土地 退化 之间 的 关系 时 ， 专家组 基准 和 指标 分组 就 评估 土地 退化 的 基准 和 指标 进行 的 工作 ， 可以 考虑 加以 分析 和 利用 。 应该 编制 一 份 关于 方法 和 可以 达到 的 目标 的 简明 文件 。 文件 的 设计 应该 简明 ， 让 利害 关系 方 易于 理解 。 9. 委员 会 不妨 鼓励 缔约方 考虑 在 制订 针对 各个 国家 的 方法 时 ， 在 国家 一级 采用 上述 建议 。 Annex [ ENGLISH ONLY ] Report of the Fourth Meeting of the Group of Experts Joint Research Centre of the European Commission Ispra , Italy , 19-23 September 2005 I.Introduction 1.The main objective of the GoE is to develop and complete concrete proposals as a product that can be forwarded to COP 7 for consideration , bearing in mind the mandate of the GoE established by the COP.Following further consultations , and in an effort to envisage the best way for a feasible process through which concrete results can be delivered within the time frame , the GoE selected a number of topics that would enable it to produce tangible results.The TOR for the GoE were based on the proposals and recommendations from the third GoE meeting in Beijing , China , in October 2004 , which identified expected concrete outputs and products.Efforts were focused on three priority issues ; outcomes would be considered by the GoE , for eventual presentation to the CST during the seventh session of the COP ( COP 7 ) in October 2005 in Nairobi , Kenya.II.Opening of the meeting ( Agenda item 1 ) 2.As host of the fourth meeting of the GoE , the representative of the European Commission , Mr.Luca Montanarella , presented a welcoming address and introduced a number of observers from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission ( JRC ).The Director of the JRC Institute for Environment and Sustainability ( IES ) , Mr.Manfred Grasserbauer , who officiated during the opening session , welcomed the participants and presented the policy objectives of the European Commission , the governance structure of the JRC and the research objectives of the Centre.He pointed out that there is a pressing need to make available the results of the scientific community as they provide the credible basis for policy decisions within the European Community(EC ) and elsewhere.The primary role of the JRC is one of policy support and a strategy for sustainable development.3.Mr.Ndegwa Ndiang'ui , representative of the UNCCD secretariat , welcomed the GoE on behalf of the Executive Secretary of UNCCD.He thanked the European Commission for generously offering to host this meeting.He recalled that the GoE had the vision to support ways and means of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the CST in the short and long term.While pointing out that the ToR of the GoE had been considered by the COP , he said that the GoE is expected to assist the CST in providing tangible and actionable well-directed products.These should be products that can be presented to COP 7.4.The Chairperson of the CST , Mr.Riccardo Valentini , recalled the expectations of the work programme of the GoE which were emphasized during the third session of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention ( CRIC 3).The CRIC reporting on B&I , traditional knowledge and best practices , has recognized the need for improving the scientific content of the reports.Through its work programme the GoE is expected to forward recommendations to the COP/CST on topics related to the scientific content of these reports.He commended the GoE for its hard work.5.The Chairperson of the GoE , Mr.David Mouat , welcomed the members and underlined the importance of this meeting that is at the crossroads for the future activities of the Group.He said that he was looking forward to a fruitful exchange of ideas during the five days , with a view to fulfilling the mandate of the GoE as set out by the COP.III.Adoption of the agenda and organization of work ( Agenda item 2)6.The Group adopted the agenda ( appendix VI ) and discussed the organization of the work.The experts stated that for improved working efficiency , a better exchange of information and transparency in decision-making and reporting were important elements.The secretariat reiterated its commitment to facilitate the work of the CST and its GoE.It was further stated that the GoE should be more proactive and should present a message to the COP/CST , shifting from an approach by proposals to an advisory capacity.IV.Development of a communication strategy : web glossary , thematic network THEMANET ( an Internet-based system of exchange of data and information ) ( Agenda item 3 ) ( Coordinator : Mr.Maurizio Sciortino ) 7.The presentation was well received.The following suggestions were made : Agriculture as a topic may not be enough.It may be more appropriate to expand it to agriculture and rural development.Monitoring and evaluation may be included as a topic.THEMANET should be as user-friendly as possible.It should be a high profile database with cutting edge technology and be different from what is being done elsewhere.Most of the topics contain exhaustive knowledge and databases.As such it would be very difficult to put such vast information on the Internet.This should be kept in mind and an appropriate strategy developed.Some topics may be integrated if possible. Separate pages for glossary , methodology and tool kit may be considered.Considering the time constraint , it was also suggested to identify some of the most important topics and to develop them for presentation at Nairobi.THEMANET may have GoE members as editors.An expert in programming is also required to contribute to the development of the system and it was agreed that a proposal be put to the European Commission to provide support for hiring a programmer.The system should be interactive so that it can be used as a strong tool for empowerment.Mr.Sciortino also requested members to suggest additional topics for coverage on THEMANET.8.A working group was set up to discuss further the objectives and topics and finalize the proposal ( appendix I).Four main topics were defined for consolidating the issue areas to be covered by THEMANET : (i)improvement of living conditions in drylands ; (ii ) natural resource management ; ( iii ) technology development application and transfer ; and(iv ) monitoring and assessment.These topics are intended to represent the uniqueness of the UNCCD process in addressing issues relevant to desertification.9. It was agreed that the website should be designed for an audience of decision-makers but that it should not be restrictive in its use and participation should be open to all stakeholders.An important part of the added value will be in empowering the users.The tool could also be used for effective implementation of the decisions of the COP.1 0.The budget that had been previously developed for THEMANET during the third meeting of the GoE is shown in appendix II below for consideration by the seventh session of the CST ( CST 7).1 1.It was agreed that THEMANET should be presented to CST 7.A presentation may be organized as a side event in order to promote this initiative to country Parties.V.Development of an integrative assessment methodology for poverty and land degradation ( Agenda item 4 ) ( Coordinator : Mr.Anders Hiort-af-Ornas ) 12.In the discussions that followed the presentation made by the coordinator , it was agreed that the approach has been appropriate.The following suggestions were made : Deliverables should be listed along with outlines of the methodology.Criteria for defining priority should be properly reflected in the methodology because poverty cannot be defined based on income alone but must also take into account the interlinkage between poverty and land degradation which evolves over time.Poverty charts for different regions may be given.More emphasis should be given to local-level assessment in specific areas.Access to the market should be considered as an important driver of poverty and therefore also of land degradation.Both qualitative and quantitative indicators of poverty should be considered.Not only success stories but also failures should be considered as lessons learned.Poverty/ land degradation is a nexus.Poverty is both a cause as well as a consequence of land degradation , and thus creates a vicious circle that needs to be kept in mind.The target audience should be well defined.Community action and community participation are vital for concretely addressin the land degradation-poverty relationship.It may not be possible to organize workshops on some issues.Communication with stakeholders is already under way at various levels under different programmes.The GoE has to rely on second-hand information.Work done by the B&I subgroup of the GoE on B&I may be considered for analysis and use in the assessment of the poverty-land degradation relationship.A simple and concise document should be prepared on the methodology and deliverables.The design should be simple and easily understood by the stakeholders.The methodology should be applicable to the CST/COP.1 3.A working group was constituted to consider the discussions that followed the presentation and suggestions were made on how to develop a strategy and approach for carrying out this task.1 4.The small group presented the results of its discussions.Several points were raised and included ( appendix III).It was agreed that after COP 7 , a budget for the methodology could be prepared.VI.Effective methodology for the assessment of desertification and drought impacts-its synthesis and the progress of pilot studies ( Agenda item 5 ) ( Coordinator : Mr.K.Takeuchi ) 15.In the discussions that followed the presentation on this topic , it was agreed that good efforts have been made to present case studies carried out in various countries , but a specific statement on methodology and deliverables has yet to be adequately spelled out.It was decided that a working group would look into the entire effort and draw up an appropriate strategy to link it with similar work carried out in other countries/regions so that a tangible product can be presented to the CST/COP.It was also agreed that the group should consider whether the short time frame is adequate.The results of the small group were later presented ( appendix IV).1 6.Several comments were made on the text and concerns were expressed on the how far the detailed TOR could be covered within the time frame ; what an effective methodology should include ; whether work should address and evaluate existing assessments including Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands ( LADA ) and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment ( MA ) , and focus on elements for guidelines ; and what would be the added value of the work for the CST and the COP.1 7.The GoE decided that more work was needed on this agenda item in order to arrive at concrete proposals for transmission to the CST.of the Group of Experts ( Agenda item 10 ) 18.The secretariat will provide , as soon as possible , the draft report of the fourth meeting of the GoE for consideration by the Group.VIII.Presentation of a strategic plan and suggestions for future activities ( Agenda item11 ) 19.A first draft of a strategic plan was presented by Ms.Mary Seely on behalf of the Chairperson of the GoE ( appendix VI).It recalled the framework that has been developed for examining landscapes from a cultural , socio-economic and biophysical point of view , with a number of questions that could be considered.The draft also identified key issues for the activities of the GoE and underlined the necessity to be proactive.It was recalled that the GoE had been established in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the CST and that a sound scientific background is mandatory for supporting the implementation of the Convention.IX.Discussion on financial support to the work of the Group of Experts ( Agenda item12 ) 20.There have been constraints to the work of the GoE , financial support being a major concern.It is the Parties'responsibility to ensure that an enabling environment is created for the Group that they established.The experts have volunteered and committed themselves to work hard to deliver as requested by the CST and they need more substantial financial support.2 1.There has been no financial planning to provide budgetary resources for the work of the Group.A formalized partnership , however , is necessary in order to support the work of the GoE in a sustainable way.It was also agreed that decisions made by the CST should be backed by budgetary allocation to facilitate the work envisaged.2 2.Scientists from the JRC made presentations on various aspects of the work undertaken by the Centre that is of relevance to the work of the GoE and the CST in general.2 3.The meeting was adjourned at 12.30 p.m. on Friday , 23 September 2005.Appendix I Consideration of a strategy to improve communication and information Working Group members : Mr.Maurizio Sciortino ( Chairperson ) , Mr.Ahmed Al-Amoud , Observer : Mr.Luca Montanarella Introduction The review and synthesis of the recommendations made by the Parties and relevant organizations on the work programme of the GoE , issued on 29 April 2002 , defined the terms of reference for the activity of the GoE , including , among other issues , the development of a mechanism , such as a thematic data net , which would facilitate coordination activities and exchange of data , experience and results , to ensure a sufficient flow of information between national coordinating bodies(NCBs ) in the period between COPs.In accordance with these terms of reference , the GoE prepared a proposal to develop a mechanism for an interactive and thematic data/metadata network ( THEMANET ) and reported its results to COP 6 in document ICCD/COP ( 6 ) / CST/3.After the presentations and the ensuing debate during the CST at COP 6 , the COP , by its decision 15/COP.6 on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the CST , requested the GoE to prioritize the work plan as contained in the framework annexed to that decision , in the light of the comments , observations and recommendations made by the CST at its sixth session , and in particular on the basis of feasibility and relevance to implementation of the Convention and to carry out the priority work plan for the next two years based on sound financial planning.The proposed strategy takes into account the comments and recommendations made by the CST , and sets the milestones and the objectives towards the implementation of the network.The main objectives of THEMANET are : (a) To implement the information and communication mechanism ; (b) To improve NCBs information and communication activities at national and international levels ; (c) To facilitate exchange of data , experiences and results among NCBs ; and(d) To facilitate efficient information flow among NCBs and the roster of independent experts.The preparation of THEMANET has been carried out in the following three phases : Development of a proposal by the GoE Development of the website prototype Presentation of the THEMANET proposal to the CST.The main milestones of THEMANET are : (a) Awareness-raising and information dissemination(b) Development and testing of the THEMANET website(c) Direct input from the experts of the Roster and national focal points and thematic programme networks ( TPNs ) and other relevant entities(d) Development of indicators of performance of THEMANET ( number of hits , uploaded and downloaded documents , etc. ) (e)Evaluation of the performance of THEMANET(f) Transfer to the secretariat for full implementation The annexed flow chart shows the main elements of the communication strategy.Conclusions and recommendations The THEMANET strategy has been reviewed and approved by the GoE as an important tool for the effective exchange of information among Parties on topical scientific and technological issues that will foster better ways of implementing their activities.The members of the GoE recognized the strategic relevance of setting up the network for the dissemination of information and committed themselves to participate in the network.After considering this proposal on a communication and information strategy , the GoE reached the following conclusions and recommended that they should be put forward for consideration by the CST : The implementation of THEMANET would require the active involvement of the roster of independent experts.Parties should be invited to use THEMANET as a communication tool.Parties should be invited to provide the means to develop and maintain THEMANET which will be hosted by the secretariat once fully operational.Parties should be invited to make use of the scientific information included in THEMANET for improving their national reports.Appendix II Estimated budget for establishing the THEMANET feasibility phase The assessment of costs refers only to the feasibility phase of the THEMANET project.United States dollars : : Administrative costs of the coordination ( post , telephone , coordination 5,000 of team ) : : Travel and accommodation costs and daily subsistence allowance of five members of the team for two meetings of two days ( US$2,000 per person ) 20,000: : Preparation of the questionnaire and elaboration of the answers to the questionnaire ( 183 country Parties ) 10 , 000: : Preparation of an information and communication technology strategy and a master plan for a pilot phase of THEMANET to be submitted to the COP through the CST 20,000 Total cost 55,000 III Consideration of the development of an integrative assessment methodology for addressing poverty and land degradation Working Group members : Mr.Anders Hiort-af-Ornas ( Chairperson ) , Mr.Alejandro Leon ( Rapporteur ) , Mr.Mohamed Badraoui , Mr. Gustavo Febles , Mr.Harish Singh , Ms.Elena Abraham , Observers : Ms.Monica Berti This report targets the Convention , promoting local-level action and community participation.It recommends that Parties should carry out literature reviews on the eight activities requested from the GoE by the COP.The proposal was reviewed and approved by the GoE on 22 September 2005 prior to being presented to the COP in Nairobi in October 2005.The proposal identifies"actionable"tasks to be performed by the Parties.The end product from the working group is a recommended methodology to be used by Parties for assessing the link between poverty and land degradation.The recommendation is therefore that Parties should use an approach in preparing a consistent methodology dealing with land degradation and poverty reduction that will lead to the formulation and maintenance of an interactive manual.While the meaning of land degradation is given by the Convention ( that is , meaning land degradation in drylands ; desertification ) , Parties need to specify clearly which working definition of poverty is being used.Based on decisions 17/COP.5 and 18/COP.5 , the following eight activities have been handed to the Working Group : Specific objective : To develop an integrative assessment methodology for poverty and land degradation. Activity 1 : Review literature which addresses social , economic and natural driving forces and pressures on land and the impacts of land degradation on society ( poverty ). Activity 2 : Assess the knowledge gaps and systematize existing research on stakeholders at different levels , connecting their activities with land use. Activity 3 : Analyse case studies to test proposed methodology of filling the gap based on an interaction process ( different stakeholders and decision-makers). Activity 4 : Develop criteria assessment for stakeholders at community level listing priorities regarding desertification and poverty issues. Activity 5 : Suggest ways of reaching community level stakeholders and local decision-makers , and strategies for building consensus , understanding vulnerability and risk , and defining priorities and solutions.Carry out a review of the scientific and technical tools that have been used for poverty assessment. Activity 7 : Analyse the interrelationships/interlinkages between poverty and land degradation in the world. Activity 8 : Develop a training manual/handbook on lessons learned ( from workshops , pilot experiences , recommended actions ) which addresses interlinkages between poverty and land degradation.Output 1 : A poverty reduction methodology and assessment report which identifies , analyses and provides recommendations for eliminating knowledge gaps.Output 2 : A study on the interlinkages between poverty and land degradation.The eight activities are dealt with in a systematic manner , by recommending that Parties should address how linkages are expressed , provide examples , list the methodologies used , and scrutinize lessons learned.The approach is provided through the matrix below.Details can be presented in an annexed discussion paper ( based on the discussion paper of the GoE meeting in Ispra).The following small adjustments to the activities have been suggested and approved by the GoE : Activity 6 is moved up to follow activity 1 since both activities are reviews that feed into the "old"activity 2 The "old"activity 2 has been reformulated in the matrix below in accordance with the above adjustment Activity 7 has been clarified in that the expression" in the world" is omitted The specification in activity 8 of lessons learned is reflected in the reporting of the results.The matrix follows the activities so that it reviews literature ( 1 ) and scientific/technical tools ( 2 ) with regard to knowledge gaps ( 3 ).These gaps need to be filled ( 4 ) , both so that stakeholders can carry out assessments ( 5 ) , and policy can reach stakeholders ( 6 ).All activities reflect the work of the Parties at the global , regional and subregional levels ( 7 ) towards the preparation of a manual that contributes to the learning process ( 8 ).The first column in the matrix summarizes the activities.The step-by-step approach to each activity in the matrix suggests that Parties first survey how the linkages poverty/ land degradation are dealt with in each activity ( column 2 ) , then to raise key issues by scrutinizing examples ( column 3 ) , followed by an understanding of how linkages are addressed ( column 4 ) , and in the final column account for lessons learned ( column 5).Matrix summarizing the Activities 1 Outputs and activity 2 How are the linkages between poverty and land degradation expressed ( focus on the linkage ) ? 3 Empirical example(s) when applicable ; few cases aiming at illustrating key phenomena 4 Methods utilized 5 Lessons learned from the assessment of poverty and land degradation ; focus on the inter-relation between these two concepts 1 Review literature which addresses social , economic and natural driving forces and pressures on land and the impacts of land degradation on society ( poverty ) Survey projects/actions , etc. ;

Purpose : Develop a framework for integrated desertification assessments.The role of UNCCD in this regard might be to serve the broad user community by promoting assessments that consider a rational and basic set of criteria for their development.We present a summary of criteria that should be considered in the development of assessments.The criteria address rationale , scales , users , methodologies , and key concerns and constraints. Rationale for conducting assessments : To provide answers to questions related to cultural , socio-economic and/ or biophysical land-use issues.To assess whether or not national and international strategic policies , plans , and programmes are having their intended impacts or benefits.To assess whether or not human development trajectories are showing a positive or negative trend.To provide tools to guide decision makers to establish and evaluate policy and programmes.To enable communities and local decision makers to determine whether or not local land use practices are sustainable.To provide a subnational to global overview on the status and trends in the socio-economic and biophysical condition of the land.To provide a baseline for the projection of future land use and land-use conditions.Scales ( and relationships among scales ) : Spatial : Assessments are made at the local , subnational , national , subregional , regional , and global spatial scales.Temporal : Assessments tend to be static and they must be considered in the context of monitoring , forecasting and projecting ( for planning purposes ) , the development of early warning systems(EWS ) , etc.They should be dynamic.Users : Users of assessments include but are not limited to farmers , ranchers ( and other household level resource users ) , community organizations and administrative units , non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) /ministry decision makers , national policy makers , national , regional and international organizations and institutions.For each of these end-users , why should assessments be made , and how can they be used ? Assessments must have a user community ( user communities ) clearly identified.Guidelines for methodologies : Ensure that assessments are undertaken at the lowest appropriate level.Encourage local-level assessments wherever relevant.Focus on sustainable ( social , economic and ecological ) development factors.Develop methodologies appropriate to the scale of the assessment ( e.g .strategies based on land survey and data collection at the local level ; and strategies based primarily on remote sensing ( RS ) and geographic information system ( GIS ) at national to global levels).RS for subnational ( watershed scale ) or lower.Identify and involve end-users at all relevant stages or steps in the assessment process.Establish communication strategies between the end-users/end-user groups and assessment communities for the dissemination of results at all relevant steps and levels and with attendant feedback mechanisms.Establish strategies for integration of assessments to ensure availability of information that is developed at one scale can also be used for assessments at other scales ( e.g .information that is developed for a local area assessment may be integrated with other spatially-based data to develop an assessment at a broader scale).Involve the user ( and/ or the affected community ) in assessment planning , data collection and interpretation where possible.Select a few appropriate benchmarks and indicators for the question being asked , based on accepted criteria ( consider benchmarks and indicators used by other conventions ) .Use traditional knowledge , where appropriate , to develop the assessment including the benchmarks and indicators.Encourage the use of " simple"assessments rather than complex ones.Take advantage and learn from ( possibly through" THEMANET" ) existing methodologies , approaches , reports , and other information relevant to the assessment.Stress this more-consider the work that has been done by other groups , especially at international level.Provide a guide to assessment methodology ( methodologies).Communication in the development of assessments between those who develop them and end-users may be difficult or non-existent.It is proposed that the end-users need to be identified prior to assessments so that clear assessment communication can be followed.The science/research community tends to conduct assessments in the absence of the user community involvement.A two-way communication strategy must be developed to implement demand-driven assessments.Assessments all too often are addressed at inappropriate scales.At all levels , baselines are frequently not considered or available.People affected , who need , or could benefit by , an assessment , are often not asking for it.In addition , those developing assessments do so in the absence of communication with people affected.It is essential that assessments be made in open and full communication among the user communities ranging from the local to the global , taking into account the need for partnerships where parties should have mutual benefits.Current assessment methodology regarding the integration of multi-scalar information for the development of assessments at different scales is not a straightforward proposition.The questions that lead to the need for an assessment are either vague or not asked.Focal points should work towards making data available and accessible.Data needed for assessments is often not readily available or accessible.Consideration of risk assessments is important.Appendix V Consideration of elements for a strategic plan for the Group of Experts of the Committee on Science and Technology ( Chairperson of the GoE : David Mouat ) The purpose of this presentation is to describe what the GoE is , what it does , and what it might do in the context of not only the needs of the CST and the UNCCD , but also of the needs of the global community to improve understanding of the process of desertification as it affects the socio-economic and biophysical landscape at varying scales , including the communities of those landscapes and especially the people who occupy those communities.The GoE was created by the CST of UNCCD in order to address tasks given to it by the CST through a defined" Work Programme" ( decision 17/COP.5 ).In considering the issue of desertification , I think that we should follow the framework that has been developed for examining landscapes from a cultural , socio-economic and biophysical point of view.This framework asks a number of questions that could be considered : What is desertification ? Where does it occur ? Who are affected ? How are they affected ? ( This includes the number of people affected , the places that are affected. ) What are the processes of desertification ? How do these processes operate ? How is desertification ( i.e .the status and trends in the condition of desertification ) changing ? How might it change ? What would be the impacts of such change on the people affected ? And on the biophysical system ? What might be done to mitigate the problem ? How might we implement suggestions to mitigate the problem ? The key issues for the GoE , as I see them , were articulated by Ms.Mary Seely , the Executive Director of the Desert Research Foundation of Namibia , a little over two years ago and they include : How do we communicate our work ( and , indeed the work of scientists throughout the world ) to the user groups ( and be sure to recognize that user groups start with community user groups and continue through the spectrum to international user groups ) ? -including media , policy makers at all levels in addition to the local users.How do we translate the results , conclusions , and recommendations of this work for understanding and use by the ultimate users ? How do we incorporate the user groups ( especially the community-based user groups ) into our work ( e.g .identification of questions ; application of results ) ? We must take the responsibility in executing the tasks that have been assigned to us to"translate"our work into a form that is useful.We must use our capabilities to figure out , that is , to develop strategies that will lead directly to improving the long-term maintenance of human well-being of people affected by desertification throughout the world.We must recognize that the GoE was established for a number of reasons.These include , among others , the ability to recognize issues , potential issues and problems as they occur and before they occur.To provide ( 1 ) independent scientific expertise , ( 2 ) owned by all categories of stakeholders , ( 3 ) building on existing information and ( 4 ) addressing desertification using a broad approach.As such , we should recognize that our mandate demands that we be proactive rather than carry on business as usual.agenda of the fourth meeting Sunday , 18 September 200518 : 00-20:00 Registration of participants and cocktail reception Monday , 19 September 200509:00-09 : 30 Registration of participants 09 : 30-10:00 Item 1.Opening of the meeting by the representative of the JRC Welcoming remarks by the Representative of the European Commission Statement by the Chairperson of the GoE Statement by the Chairperson of the CST Statement by the representative of the UNCCD secretariat Chairing of meeting by the Chairperson of the GoE 10 : 00-10 : 15 Item 2.Adoption of the agenda and organization of work Review of the expectations by the CST and the COP ( secretariat ) 10 : 30-12 : 30 Item 3.Report from Task Assignment 1 Development of a communication strategy : web-based glossary ; thematic data network ( Sciortino ) 14:00-15 : 30 Continuation of consideration of Item 315 : 45-17 : 30 Continuation of consideration of Item 317 : 30-18:00 Discussion Tuesday , 20 September 200509:00-10 : 30 Item 4.Report from Task Assignment 2 Development of an integrative assessment methodology for poverty and land degradation ( Ornas ) 10 : 45-12 : 30 Continuation of consideration of Item 414:00-15 : 30 Continuation of consideration of Item 415 : 45-17:00 Item 5.Report from Task Assignment 3 Proposing effective methodologies for the assessment of desertification at the global , regional and local levels ( Takeuchi ) 17:00-18:00 Continuation of consideration of Item 5 Wednesday , 21 September 200509:00-10 : 30 Continuation of consideration of Item 510 : 45-12 : 30 Item 6.Chairperson's Working Groups sessions 14:00-15 : 30 Continuation of consideration of Item 615 : 45-18:00 Item 7.
