The Romanian Government would like to inform the UN Special Rapporteurs that a right to reply has been sent to and published by the New York Times , following the publication of the article of David Johnston and Mark Mazzetti ( namely" Interrogation inc : A window into CIA' s embrace of secret jails" ). Since the Romanian authorities rejected the allegation , we would appreciate that the report of the UN Special Rapporteurs will include the position expressed.c. In particular , the Romanian Government would appreciate if the UN Special Rapporteurs would split the para 112 , just after the reference to the New York Time article of August 200 9.In our opinion , there are two different aspects contained in the same paragraph.We would appreciate if the information based on the testimony of several former detainees of the CIA program would be kept separate from the allegations regarding the Romanian involvement in this program.d. In para 118 , the report quotes the conclusions of the inquiry made by a Romanian NGO , the Organization for the Defense of Human Rights(OADO ).The report of the Romanian NGO-OADO is annexed to the Report of the Romanian Parliamentary Inquiring Committee.Therefore , we would appreciate if the report of the UN Special Rapporteurs will include the final conclusions of the Romanian Parliamentary Inquiring Committee ( chapter 6 ) , namely : "1.The Committee answers" Negative"to the question if there are/there were secret American bases in Romania.2. The Committee answers" Negative"to the question if there were in the period under investigation , facilities for detaining prisoners , other than the penitentiary ones ( real , secret , ad-hoc , off-hand buildings used with that aim , eventually in the neighborhood of Timisoara , Bucharest-Otopeni or Baneasa and Constantza airports).3. The Committee answers" Negative"to the question if there are/there were detained individuals , with or without documents , in the penitentiary system of Romania who could be assimilated as prisoners.4.The Committee answers" Negative"to the question if there could be some weaknesses in the overall traffic control system ( civil or military ) or if , as a consequence of negligence , some flights could have been overlooked by the recording or monitoring systems or without applying ground procedures provided by international conventions.5. The Committee answers" Negative"to the question if it would have been possible that certain Romanian institutions consciously participated ( or participated by omission or negligence ) in operations of illegal transport of prisoners through the airspace or on the Romanian airports.6.The Committee answers" Negative"to the question if American or any other state civil flights could have transported , gotten off or taken on board individuals that could be considered as imprisoned , on the Romanian territory or under the responsibility of the Romanian authorities , according to the international regulations.7.The Committee answers" Positive"to the question if there was an in-depth parliamentarian investigation aimed at establishing the media allegations on the existence of some detention centers and of some flights with illegal prisoners in Romania.8.With regard to the question about the aim of the stopovers in Romania of the flights mentioned in Chapter 5 , the Committee has strong arguments to reply that they had nothing in common with any possible illegal transports of prisoners on the Romanian territory." e.Based on the Romanian authorities'verifications , a number of airplanes that proved to be rented by the CIA made stopovers on Romanian airports.The national investigations concluded that those stopovers had a mere technical purpose.There is no data whatsoever that detainees were on board of those airplanes.
