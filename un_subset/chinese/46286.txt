AUGUST 2008 ： Russian Policy Toward Georgia in the Months Before the Invasion Key points ： The Days Before , During& After Russia's Invasion of Georgia Detailed Chronology ： he Days Before , During& After Russia's Invasion of Georgia Russian ESCALATION 2004-July 2008 ： Key Developments in the Russian Military& Political Escalation Before the Invasion of Georgia Georgian peace proposals repeatedly rejected by Russia ( 2004 onwards ) ： Beginning in 2004 , the Georgian Government has repeatedly proposed to launch a genuine peace process for South Ossetia and Abkhazia.Years of stalemate had left all ethnic populations in both conflict zones impoverished and without any effective protection of basic rights ； Georgians in particular were targeted and persecuted on ethnic grounds.The Russian Federation and separatist leaders have rejected Georgia's peace initiatives each and every time they have been proposed--even when the international community backed the initiatives.As a result , South Ossetia and Abkhazia have become hubs for acute criminal activity , including kidnapping , extortion , counterfeiting , smuggling of arms and drugs.At least one case of nuclear smuggling has been confirmed ( Annex 1).Russia gains stranglehold over separatist governments ( 2005 onwards ) ： In recent years , Moscow has been exerting an increasingly strong hold over the separatist governments ； since 2005 , Russian military and civilian officials seconded from Moscow effectively have been governing South Ossetia ( Annex 2).Russia builds illegal base near Tskhinvali ( 2006 ) ： In spring 2006 , Russian forces illegally build of a forward military base in the strategically located town of Java ( north of Tskhinvali).The base has capacity for 2 , 500 soldiers , and includes substantial fuel-storage capabilities for tanks and other armored vehicles.CIS arms/economic embargo lifted illegally by Moscow ( March 2008 ) ： In March , the Russian Federation unilaterally--and illegally--withdraws from a CIS economic and arms embargo imposed in 1994 on the secessionist region of Abkhazia , Georgia. International community condemns Russia's legal recognition of S.Ossetia&Abkhazia ( April 2008 ) ： On April 16 , Moscow sharply escalates tensions by decreeing the establishment of legal links between Russia and the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia ； this is a form of de facto annexation of Georgian territory and draws sharp rebukes from the entire international community--including the EU , the US , the OSCE , and others , who call for the immediate reversal of this Russian decision.United Nations confirms Russia downs Georgian aircraft over Georgian airspace ( April 2006 ) ： On April 20 , a Russian fighter jet downs an unarmed Georgian drone ( MIA ) over Georgian airspace ( near Ganmukhuri ) ， an act of aggression confirmed by formal UNOMIG and OSCE investigative reports. ( Annex 3 ) Russia increases troop strength& introduces paratroopers into Abkhazia ( May/June 2008 ) ： In the following weeks , Russia continues to unilaterally increase its troop strength in Abkhazia , without fulfilling its legal obligation to seek the consent of Georgia ； among other moves , it deploys paratrooper units , which are incompatible with the existing format for peacekeeping.Russia moves illegal heavy weaponry& offensive forces into Abkhazia ( May/June 2008 ) ： In direct contravention of all peacekeeping norms and agreements , Russia introduces additional offensive military troops and heavy weaponry in Abkhazia , verified by UNOMIG.Russian railroad troops sent to Abkhazia to prepare rails for invasion ( May 26 , 2008 ) ： On May 26 , Russia sends more than 400 hundreds of Ministry of Defense"railroad troops"into Abkhazia to reinforce the rail infrastructure needed for military action ； these troops do not belong to any peacekeeping unit.As peace plan advances , Russian provocations move to S.Ossetia ( July 2008 ) ： In July , as the efforts by Georgia and the international community to advance peace proposals for Abkhazia are gathering pace , the focus of Russian provocations suddenly shifts to South Ossetia. Separatists attempt to assassinate S.Ossetian unionist leader ( July 3 , 2008 ) ： On July 3 , South Ossetian separatists attempt to assassinate Dimitry Sanakoyev , the Head of the Temporary Administration of South Ossetia ； three policemen are injured.Russia defiantly acknowledges violating Georgian airspace ( July 10 , 2008 ) ： On July 9 , Four Russian military aircraft violate Georgian airspace on the eve of US Secretary of State Rice's visit to Georgia.Although Russia continually violates Georgian airspace , this is the first time Moscow acknowledges it has done so deliberately.Russia undertakes large-scale military exercises near S.Ossetia：&Abkhazia ( July 2008 ) ： Russia launches large-scale military exercises ( July 15- August 2 ) in the immediate vicinity of Georgia's northern border ； they are named" Caucasus 2008." The Russian Defense Ministry claims that the exercises , involving over 8,000 troops and 700 pieces of military hardware , are aimed at preparing for"special peace enforcement operations "in the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.During the exercise , anti- Georgian leaflets are distributed entitled" Know Your Enemy".Russian troops fail to redeploy ( August 22008 ) ： Russian troops participating in the exercise do not re-deploy from the region when the exercises are finished. Separatists reject German-mediated peace plan ( July 18 , 2008 ) ： On July 18 , Abkhaz separatists reject a German-mediated peace plan and refuse to attend peace talks scheduled in Berlin.EU organizes peace talks , separatists fail to appear ( July 22-24 , 2008 ) ： On July 22-24 , the EU tries to hold talks in Brussels between representatives of the Government of Georgia and the South Ossetian separatists , with the participation of the Russian Federation.The separatists refuse to participate , initially objecting to the title of Minister Yakobashvili--"Minister for Reintegration." In response , the Georgian Government appoints Mr.Yakobashvili as a Special Envoy for Conflict Resolution.The separatists once again refuse to attend the talks on unspecified grounds.OSCE proposes peace talks , separatists reject proposal ( late July 2008 ) ： OSCE Chairman in Office , Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb , proposes talks in Helsinki in early August between South Ossetian separatists and the Georgian Government.The separatists reject the proposal.KEY POINTS：The Days Before , During& After Russia's Invasion of Georgia July 3 ： One month before Russia's invasion into Georgia , separatists try to assassinate Dimitri Sanakoyev , Head of the Temporary Administration of South Ossetia.A remote control road bomb exploded while Mr Sanakoyev's cortege was passing by.Five policemen accompanying Mr. Sanakoyev were wounded.Mr. Sanakoyev--a former separatist fighter and defense minister in the separatist government-laid down his arms in 2006 to promote the peaceful re-integration of the region with the rest of the country under a broad autonomy arrangement.Mr. Sanakoyev was elected in democratic elections and administered up to 50% of the territory of the region.July 29 ： For the first time since last major hostilities , separatist militia begin intensively shelling ethnically mixed villages under Georgian control , including those of them where the Georgian peacekeepers held their check-points , with large-caliber artillery ( greater than 82 mm ) which is prohibited by existing agreements.This fact is formally acknowledged by the Head of " Peacekeeping Forces , "Russian General Marat Kulakhmetov on August 4 ( he makes specific reference to the shelling on villages under Government control on August 1 and 2 with high caliber artillery ).Shelling of this magnitude continues on a regular basis through August 7 , in advance of the Russian land invasion into Georgia.1 August ： A pickup truck carrying six police officers of MIA of Georgia is hit by two remote-control explosive devices ( IED ) on the Eredvi-Kheiti bypass road , close to the Government controlled enclave north of the city of Tskhinvali.Five policemen are severely wounded.3 August ： Russian media outlets report the large-scale mobilization of volunteers across the Russian North Caucasus , including pledges by Cossacks to deploy mercenary troops into Georgia.4 August ： The separatists announce the evacuation of the civilian population from Tskhinvali and from the separatist controlled villages of the region.5& 7 August ： At the request of President Saakashvili , Special Envoy Temur Yakobashvili twice attempts to negotiate with separatists , but his requests are rebuffed.7 August ： The Special Envoy of Russia's Foreign Ministry , Yuri Popov , fails to mediate preliminary agreed talks on a ceasefire , citing refusal by the separatists , while shelling of Villages under Government control continues.General Kulakhmetov , during the meeting in Tskhinvali with Special Envoy Yakobashvili , declares that he cannot contact the separatist leaders , and that Russian"peacekeepers"cannot stop the separatist attacks ； General Kulakhmetov admits that the separatists were shooting from the vicinity of Russian"peacekeeping " posts.In spite of casualties among Georgian peacekeepers and civilians killed by separatist fire , President Saakashvili orders an immediate ceasefire and calls for negotiations.He reaffirms the Government's proposal to grant broad" European standard"autonomy to the region , and offers Russia to serve as a guarantor.President Saakashvili also announces an unconditional amnesty for separatists who agree to cease hostilities.Despite the ceasefire declared by President Saakashvili , the separatists intensify their shelling of villages under Georgian control and Georgian peacekeeper posts.Approximately 150 armored vehicles and military trucks of the Russian regular army stream into the Roki Tunnel and head towards Tskhinvali.In response to the entry of Russian armed forces into Georgian territory , the Georgian military enters the conflict zone in the region.Russia claims that its forces entered Georgian territory only after a purported" surprise Georgian assault"on Tskhinvali ； however Russia continues to refuse to make public the time at which it launched its invasion into Georgia.8 August ： The Ministry of Defense of Russia and various senior officials claim that Georgian forces"have killed 2,000 civilians"in Tskhinvali.11 August ： Human Rights Watch representative say that Russia purposely exaggerated casualty figures in Tskhinvali , leading to revenge killings against the ethnic Georgian population ( Annex 4).21 August ： The Russian Prosecutor General's Office reports significantly lower civilian casualty figures in the South Ossetia region at 133.There is a strong likelihood that the majority of these casualties were separatist militiamen , as local officials frequently refer to non-Russian servicemen as civilians ( Annexes 5 and 6).9 - 24 August ： Following the retreat of Georgian armed forces towards Tbilisi , the Russian armed forces and paramilitary groups conduct widespread atrocities , including the burning , looting , kidnapping , raping , and summary executions of Georgian civilians inside and outside the zone of conflict.Within the zone of conflict , entire villages of Eredvi , Avnevi , Nuli , Kurta , Achabeti , Tamarasheni , Kekhvi , Disevi , etc. ， are deliberately burned and destroyed , resulting in the ethnic cleansing of Georgians.Many of these events are confirmed in reports issued by international human rights organizations.

Georgian artillery and aviation conducted a targeted attacks on the Gupta bridge , where Russian armed columns where entering Tskhinvali.Outskirts of Tskhivali and Inside Tskhinvali Tskhinvali is a small regional town , located in a river valley , approximately 75 kilometers from Tbilisi.Immediately prior to the conflict , the population was approximately 7,000 , based on local intelligence estimates and on-the-ground reports.Following the mass evacuation on August 3-5 , the number of residents decreased substantially.Several Georgian positions were under attack from points on the outskirts of town , specifically from Verkhny Gorodok ( the location of the Russian"peacekeepers" on the non-residential southwest portion of the city ) .This was the first position in the immediate vicinity of Tskhinvali that Georgian forces targeted using GRAD multiple-rocket launching systems , following repeated warnings to the Russian"peacekeeping " forces not to allow their positions to be used for attacks.Soon thereafter , Georgian artillery ( again using GRADs ) targeted stockpiles of munitions and fuel depots located on the western part of the city--outside civilian areas--and military barracks in the northwest part of Tskhinvali--also outside civilian areas.At approximately 11 ： 00 , once Georgian forces had secured the heights around Tskhinvali , Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior forces entered the city of Tskhinvali.These forces came under fire from positions around the main government compound , located in the center of Tskhinvali.In response , Georgian forces employed precise artillery system Dana ( not GRAD ) against the ministries of defense , interior , intelligence ( KGB ) ， and the main government building of the separatists.Russian aviation bombed Georgian positions on a continuous basis inside and around Tskhinvali once Government forces began advancing on the town.Russian aviation continued bombing in and around Tskhinvali for the next two days ( until late in the day on August 10 ) .At approximately 14：00 , Georgian forces took control of most of Tskhinvali.At 15：00 , Georgian forces declared a 3-hour ceasefire to establish a humanitarian corridor. Georgian forces began a phased retreat from Tskhinvali during the evening of August 9.Forces re-positioned themselves south of the city.During the two days that Georgian forces were in control of separatist controlled villages ( from August 8 ) there were no credible reports of looting or abuse of civilian populations , according to international human rights organizations.The ethnic Ossetian population in the conflict zone was not displaced , unlike the ethnic Georgian population under the Russian occupation.The only village that sustained severe damage was the village of Khetagurovo due to the location of substantial amounts of military equipment and forces around the villa After Government forces seized Khetagurovo , there was no cruel or degrading treatment of the civilian population , as documented by Human Rights Watch ( Annex 11 ).Russian Attacks&Invasion Outside the Conflict Zone Ethnic Cleansing of Georgian Villages Beginning on August 8 at 09 ： 45 , Russian aviation bombed a series of civilian and military targets across Georgia , outside the zone of conflict in South Ossetia , damaging infrastructure and causing significant civilian casualties.
